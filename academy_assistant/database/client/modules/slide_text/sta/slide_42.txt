Force Actuators vs Angular-momentum Actuators

• Angular-momentum actuators (e.g., reaction wheels) can apply torques to a spacecraft
    • Internal torques
    • System angular momentum is constant: rotating wheel in one direction makes spacecraft rotate in the opposite direction
    • They require only electrical power (no expendables)
    • Momentum accumulates over time so it needs to be “dumped” periodically ➔ need external torquers for that (e.g., magnetic torquers)

• Force actuators (e.g., thrusters) can apply forces and torques to a spacecraft
    • Torques are “external”
    • System angular momentum is not necessarily constant
    • They enable simultaneous control of mass-center position and attitude
    • Most require mass expulsion (propellant, an expendable)
