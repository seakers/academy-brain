Main considerations

- **Fitting in the launch vehicle** – Launch vehicle fairing dimensions
- **Static loads** – All critical loads including buckling must be above loads seen during launch and operations
- **Dynamic loads** – Natural frequencies including fundamental bending mode must be above those encountered in the environment (launch vehicle)
- **Material selection**
  - Stiffness, strength, weight (density), ductility, coefficient of thermal expansion, fatigue, outgassing
- **Mass**
  - Cost driver
