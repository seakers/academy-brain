Thermal Subsystem Functions

- Control the temperature of spacecraft and its components by:
  - Dissipating excess heat (typically passive radiators)
  - Cooling down certain components (e.g., instrument focal planes)
  - Heating up certain components (e.g., sometimes batteries)
- Spacecraft have to survive in extremely hot and cold environments
- They have to withstand extreme temperature changes in short amounts of time
