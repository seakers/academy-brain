Bit Error Rate (BER)

• The Bit Error Rate is the probability that an error will be made in one bit when decoding a symbol.
• It is a measure of quality of the communications, and one of the main requirements of a communications system
    • The other one being the data rate (i.e. the quantity of data)
• Typical BER are on the order of \(10^{-5}\)
    • Lower BERs can be accepted for non-critical applications
• BER depends on two main parameters:
    • The signal to noise ratio (typically expressed in terms of \(E_b/N_0\))
    • The modulation chosen: for example, for the same BER, BPSK and QPSK require 3dB less of \(E_b/N_0\) than 8PSK.
