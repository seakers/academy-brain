Spacecraft fundamental frequency

- Example: Spacecraft on launch vehicle (k bending stiffness of "cantilever beam")
\[ \omega = 2\pi f = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad k = \frac{3EI}{L^3} \]

- Where \( L \) is the distance from launch adapter to spacecraft center of mass, \( E \) is the Young's modulus \([Pa]\) and \( I \) is the area moment of inertia \([m^4]\)

- This fundamental frequency is often on the order of tens of Hz for typical spacecraft (see empirical data).

- It must be greater than a threshold provided in the launch vehicle guide. For Falcon 9:
  - Fundamental bending mode > 10Hz
  - Fundamental axial mode > 25Hz
