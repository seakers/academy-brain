3-axis control based on thrusters

TABLE 11-1. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

| Type | Pointing Options | Attitude Maneuverability | Typical Accuracy | Lifetime Limits |
|------|------------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Gravity-gradient (Earth only) | Earth local vertical only | No constraints | 45 deg (3 axes) | None |
| Gravity-gradient and Momentum Wheel (Earth only) | Earth local vertical only | Very limited | 45 deg (3 axes) | Life of wheel bearings |
| Passive Magnetic | Not seriously constrained by slew rate | Very limited | 25 deg (3 axes) | None |
| Pure Spin Stabilization | Internally fixed high propellant any direction except with momentum vector | High propellant and momentum vector | ±1 deg to ±10 deg in spin axis; proportional to spin rate | Thruster propellant or propellant |
| Dual Spin Stabilization | Limited only by despin platform momentum | Momentum vector same as above. Despin platform constrained by its own geometry | Same as above for spin axis. Despun platform dictated by its pointing | Thruster propellant or spin axis bearings |
| Bias Momentum (1 wheel only) | Best suited for nadir pointing | Momentum vector same as above. Wheel precess to other planes, conserving momentum | ±0.1 deg to ±1 deg | Propellant (if required); Life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (thruster only) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.1 deg to ±0.5 deg | Propellant |
| Zero Momentum (3 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±0.1 deg | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (4 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±0.1 deg | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |

*Thrusters may be used for slewing and momentum dumping at all altitudes. Magnetic torques may be used from LEO to GEO.

Thrusters used for changing attitude
High torque so great for good satellites, but not great for fine attitude maneuvers
Spend propellant which is a consumable so that limits lifetime
