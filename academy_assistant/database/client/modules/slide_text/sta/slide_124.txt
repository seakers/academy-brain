Input/output

• Data bus
  • Reserved for high-speed data transfers (>33MHz or >500Mbps)
  • Processor bus: usually 16, 32 or 64 bit wide
  • Spacecraft bus: usually 16, 32 or 64 bit wide
    • Usually VME, PCI (older: ISA)
• Digital I/O
  • Usually interfaced through the processor bus directly to the CPU
    • Mapped I/O: programs address this I/O directly as part of the CPU
  • Enables direct control of parallel digital signals
    • Usually 1-bit or 1-byte at a time, but can have custom size
• Custom I/O
  • A/D
  • Ports (UART, I²C, USB)
