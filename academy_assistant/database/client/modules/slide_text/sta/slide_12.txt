Power budget

- An even more detailed version of a power budget would provide power requirements over time for each component for a representative “day in the life” of the spacecraft


The slide also contains two graphs. The first graph shows power requirements for different activities (Driving Cycles, Communication, Thinking Cycles) over time, with three cases labeled \( P_{sa, \text{case 1}} \), \( P_{sa, \text{case 2}} \), and \( P_{sa, \text{case 3}} \). The second graph shows power consumption over time for different components (payload, platform, spacecraft).
