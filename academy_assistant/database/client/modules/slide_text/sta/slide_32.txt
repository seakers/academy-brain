They must be elongated
Basic gravity gradient cannot control yaw
➔ Add momentum wheel on pitch axis

[Table 11-4: Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.]

Type: Gravity-gradient
Pointing Options: Earth local vertical only
Attitude Maneuverability: Very limited
Typical Accuracy: ±5 deg (2 axes)
Lifetime Limits: None

Type: Gravity-gradient and momentum
Pointing Options: Earth local vertical only
Attitude Maneuverability: Very limited
Typical Accuracy: ±5 deg (2 axes)
Lifetime Limits: Use of wheel bearings
