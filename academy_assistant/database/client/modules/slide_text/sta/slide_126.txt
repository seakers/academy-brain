Radiation hardening

• Radiation affects electronic components due to particle momentum, EM fields, and electrostatic charges
• High energy neutrons cause structural damage in solid state materials
• Charge on gates of metal-oxide semiconductors can change their state – single event upset (SEU)
    • Magnetic components (HD’s, ROM) can be unintentionally reconfigured
• High energy charged particles generate clouds of electrical charges
    • Digital logic slows down
    • Op Amp offset voltages change
    • Current capability is reduced
    • CMOS can latch up across the power supply
        • Power dissipation increases
• Electronic components are covered with materials to minimize these effects, adds a lot to cost
