Central Processing Units (CPU)

- **General purpose vs custom** instruction sets (Can influence cost)
- **Micro-controller Units (MCU)**
  - Small, dedicated processor to perform very specific tasks
    - 1-100MHz, <16MB RAM, ROM storage (no HD/Mass storage)
- **Digital Signal Processors (DSP)**
  - Specifically designed to manage embedded digital systems
  - High processing/power ratio (e.g., 1GIPS @ <6W)
    - 100MHz - 1GHz, 16MB to 2GB RAM, ROM storage, FLASH storage
- **Microprocessors (μP)**
  - Intel architecture, Power PC instruction set most common
  - Most powerful processors; but high power consumption
    - >1GIPS, 50-200W, 4GB+ RAM, ROM storage, HD’s, CD-ROM’s, etc.
  - General purpose instruction set (available commands)
