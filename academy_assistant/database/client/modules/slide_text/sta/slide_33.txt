TABLE 11-4. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

*Thrusters may be used for slewing and momentum dumping at all altitudes. Magnetic torquers may be used from LEO to GEO.

Very limited for purely passive, more useful if we add magnetic torquers. Only useful close to Earth and for small sats.
