Module: Spacecraft Technologies and Architectures
Slide Number: 63
Slide text:
- There are 2 main types of thermal control systems:
  - Passive (usually cheaper)
  - Active (requires more energy)
- Materials and coatings
  - Use paints, mirrors, silvered plastics...
  - Play with \(\frac{\alpha_{VNIR}}{\epsilon_{TIR}}\)
- Multi-layer insulation
  - Used to isolate S/C from thermal environment
  - Multiple layers of aluminized Mylar or Kapton with a thin net of material between them
  - Without air, primary coupling is radiation, not conduction
  - High reflectivity, low emissivity \(\Rightarrow\) very little transfer between layers
