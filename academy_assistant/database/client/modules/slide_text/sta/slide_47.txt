Example Delta V budget for a GEO satellite

• GTO-GEO transfer: 1,500 m/s
• Station keeping: 50 m/s/yr * 15 yrs = 750 m/s
• Evasive maneuvers: 50 m/s
• Attitude control: 2 m/s/yr * 15 yrs = 30 m/s
• Deorbiting: 20 m/s
• Total: 2,350 m/s

• Sometimes, a dedicated engine is used for the GTO-GEO transfer and then jettisoned but the same engine can be used too if all other requirements are compatible.
