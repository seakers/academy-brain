Processing Architectures

• Centralized
  • One processor designated as the master unit which provides all housekeeping and data handling
  • All commands are processed and routed through this central unit

• Distributed (multi-processor) architectures
  • Multiple processors divide the avionics tasks: two possible configurations:
    • Distributed Computing
      • Executive tasks are shared by all processors
      • Dedicated processors assigned to each sub-system
      • Communicate through the spacecraft bus
    • Redundant processing
      • Multiple processors can assume the role of master
      • Tolerates faults well
