Dual-spin satellites

TABLE 11-1. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

| Type | Pointing Options | Attitude Maneuverability | Typical Accuracy | Lifetime Limits |
|------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Gravity-gradient | Earth local vertical only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | None |
| Gravity-gradient and Momentum Bias Wheel | Earth local vertical only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | Life of wheel bearings |
| Passive Magnetic | North/south only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | None |
| Pure Spin Stabilization | Inertially fixed spin axis (often aligned with momentum vector) | High propellant usage for any change in momentum vector | ±1 deg to ±3 deg (1 axis proportional to spin rate) | Thruster propellant or gas supply |
| Dual-Spin Stabilization | Limited by despin platform and payload | Momentum vector same as above for spin stabilization | Same as above for spin stabilization | Thruster propellant or gas supply, life of despin bearings |
| Low Momentum (1 wheel) | Best suited for inertial pointing | Momentum vector can be changed to any plane, considering wheel momentum | ±0.1 deg to ±1 deg (3 axes) | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Low Momentum (3 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±0.1 deg (3 axes) | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (3 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±0.1 deg (3 axes) | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |

*Thrusts may be used for slewing and momentum dumping at all altitudes. Magnetic torques may be used in LEO to GEO.

Allows the payload to stay fix while the rest of the satellite rotates
Also very common in old GEO satellites
