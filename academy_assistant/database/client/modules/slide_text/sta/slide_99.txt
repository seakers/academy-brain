Design process

1. Allocate mission and system requirements
   • Establish functional requirements of avionics system: what and why?
   • Evaluate candidate architectures: how?
   • Partition by function: develop block diagrams
   • Determine feasibility: risk vs capabilities
   • Develop non-intrusive testing methodologies: “black box” testing

2. Define the computer system’s operational modes and states
   • Develop state diagram consistent with functional requirements
   • Model different operational stages as different states
   • Ensure degradation/failure states are modeled
   • Consider effects on ground/ops for all states
