From Delta V to propellant

• Delta V is important because it determines the amount of propellant needed in the spacecraft
• The rocket equation captures the relation between ΔV and propellant mass for a given technology ($I_{sp}$)
\[ \Delta V = g_0 I_{sp} \ln \left( \frac{m_i}{m_f} \right) \]
    • Where $m_i$ is the initial mass with propellant and $m_f$ is the final mass after the maneuver (without the propellant)
• Rearranging terms:
\[ \frac{m_{prop}}{m_{dry}} = e^{\frac{\Delta V}{g_0 I_{sp}}} - 1 \]
• Thus, the ratio of propellant mass to “dry mass” increases exponentially with ΔV
    • This is the rocket equation “wall”
        • Note that the total mass of the propulsion system also scales with propellant mass
• For a given ΔV, the amount of propellant needed strongly depends on $I_{sp}$
