Spin-stabilized satellites

TABLE 11-4. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

| Type | Pointing Capabilities | Attitude Maneuverability | Typical Accuracy | Lifetime Limits |
|------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Gravity-gradient (Earth only) | Earth local vertical only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | None |
| Passive Magnetic (Earth only) | North only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | Life of wheel bearings |
| Pure Spin Stabilization | Nominally fixed high precision attitude with respect to spin momentum vector | ±1 deg to ±10 deg (proportional to spin rate) | None | Thruster propellant or propeller |
| Bias Spin Stabilization | Limited by 3-axis platform | Momentum vector despin allows 3-axis platform control by gyroscopically stiff platform | Same as above for spin axis, ±1 deg to ±10 deg for platform | Thruster propellant or propeller, life of bearings |
| Single Momentum Wheel (3 wheels) | Best suited for single axis pointing | Momentum vector despin allows 3-axis platform control by gyroscopically stiff platform | ±0.1 deg to ±1 deg | Propellant, life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (2/3 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±1 deg | Propellant, life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (4 wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±1 deg | Propellant, life of sensor and wheel bearings |

Whole satellite rotates about an axis
Imager uses satellite rotation to sweep the Earth (not ideal)
Very common in old GEO satellites but not anymore
