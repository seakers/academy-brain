Functions of the A(O)DC subsystem

- **Navigating:** Taking measurements of spacecraft
  - Attitude (orientation)
  - Position

- **Guiding:** Computing
  - Attitude and position corrections based on navigation and goals
  - Commands for the actuators based on those corrections

- **Controlling:** Executing commands that change position/attitude

- **Note:** ADCS focuses on attitude. Propulsion subsystem usually handles orbit changes but sometimes ADCS thrusters are used for orbit control as well
