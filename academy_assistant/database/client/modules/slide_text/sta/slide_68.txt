Slide text:
- The simplest communications architecture of a mission consists of the satellite and a single ground station
- We distinguish between the uplink (commands) and the downlink (telemetry and science data), primary cost drivers for the system
- Downlink typically drives sizing
- Sometimes, different comm systems handle TM/TC vs science data
- Data rate is also primary cost driver for the system along with mass
