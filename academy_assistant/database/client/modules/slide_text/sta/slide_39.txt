3-axis control based on control moment gyros

TABLE 11-1. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities. As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

| Type | Pointing Options | Attitude Maneuverability | Typical Accuracy | Lifetime Limits |
|------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Gravity-gradient Earth local vertical only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | None |
| Gravity-gradient plus Wheel | Earth local vertical only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | Life of wheel bearings |
| Passive Magnetic | North/south only | Very limited | ±5 deg (2 axes) | None |
| Pure Spin Stabilization | Spin axis fixed inertially (or with momentum wheel despin) | High propellant cost for spin axis reorientation | ±1 deg (1 axis) | Thruster propellant or gas jets |
| Dual-Spin Stabilization | Spin axis fixed inertially (or with momentum wheel despin) | High propellant cost for spin axis reorientation | ±1 deg (1 axis) | Thruster propellant or gas jets |
| Momentum Bias (1 Wheel) | Momentum vector fixed inertially or along platform | Same as above for momentum vector reorientation | ±1 deg (1 axis) | Thruster propellant or gas jets |
| Base Momentum (1 Wheel) | Best suited for nadir pointing | Momentum vector reorientation by wheel torque, considering platform constraints | ±0.1 deg to ±0.5 deg | Propellant for initial spin-up, life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (3 Wheels) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.01 deg to ±0.5 deg | Propellant for initial spin-up, life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (3 Magnetic Torquers) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.01 deg to ±1 deg | Propellant for initial spin-up, life of sensor and wheel bearings |
| Zero Momentum (4 CMG) | No constraints | No constraints | ±0.001 deg to ±1 deg | Life of sensor and wheel bearings |

*Thrusts may be used for slewing and momentum dumping at all altitudes. Magnetic torquers may be used from LEO to GEO.

Highest performance (and cost) configuration
CMGs provide high torques and high accuracies
