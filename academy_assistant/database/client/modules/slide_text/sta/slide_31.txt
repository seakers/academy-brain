**ADCS Configurations**

- Passive configurations exist that take advantage of nature (e.g., gravity gradient, magnetic field) to make the spacecraft naturally stable around a desired attitude
- These configurations are very cheap, but they also have poor performance (5-10 deg control accuracy) and impose heavy constraints on the spacecraft shape or ConOps (e.g., the spacecraft must be elongated, or must be spinning all the time around some axis)
- Continuously spinning either the whole satellite or just a wheel inside it provides some stability but also limits agility
- Nowadays, most satellites use reaction wheels or similar actuators to very finely control the attitude of the spacecraft in 3 axes.

**TABLE 11-4. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities.** As requirements become tighter, more complex control systems become necessary.

*Thrusters may be used for slewing and momentum dumping at all altitudes. Magnetic torquers may be used from LEO to GEO.
