Batteries

• Batteries are arrays of electrochemical cells connected in series/parallel that transform chemical energy into electricity
• Each cell has a cathode and an anode connected by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations.
• Electrons travel from anode to cathode through redox reactions.
• Each cell produces 1-3V. Sizing:
    • #cells in series determines V
    • #cells in parallel fixes I, current

Example, for Ni-Cd battery, using KOH as electrolyte, during discharge:
    Anode (oxidation): Cd + 2OH^- \rightarrow Cd(OH)_2 + 2e^-
    Cathode (reduction): 2NiO(OH) + 2H_2O + 2e^- \rightarrow 2Ni(OH)_2 + 2OH^-
