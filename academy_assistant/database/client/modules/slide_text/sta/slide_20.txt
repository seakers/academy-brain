Basic solar array sizing

- Estimate solar array mass
\[ m_{SA} = A \cdot \rho_s = \frac{P_{sa}}{M_{sp}} \, [\text{kg}] \]

  - \(\rho_s\) is the surface density of the solar array (mass per unit area), typically \(2.3-2.8 \, \text{kg/m}^2\)
  - \(M_{sp}\) is the specific power of solar array (power per unit mass), typically \(90-110 \, \text{W/kg}\)

- Define the configuration of the solar panel(s): #panels, orientation, body-mounted vs deployable, articulation, etc.
  - Deployable solar panels are more expensive than body-mounted ones
  - Articulated solar panels that can track the sun in 1 or 2 degrees of freedom are more expensive than fixed ones
