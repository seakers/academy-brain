Types of functions

- Operating system vs Application software
  - OS Manages the computer’s resources
    - input/output devices, memory, and scheduling of application software
  - Application includes mission-specific software which does work required by the user or the mission rather than in support of the computer
    - Payload management

- Hard vs Soft real-time processing
  - Hard real-time requires precise timing to achieve correct results – missing a time boundary has severe consequences
    - ADCS, telemetry
  - Soft real-time requires that the tasks be performed in a timely manner – missing a time boundary results in degraded but continuous performance
    - Orbit control, orientation of solar panels, payload management
