Slide text: 
- The capacity of a battery is the total energy stored,
  - Typically measured in Wh or Ah
  - Sized to power spacecraft during eclipse
- Depth of Discharge (DOD) of a battery is the percentage of capacity that is used in each charge-discharge cycle
- Battery life (# cycles) decreases with DOD
  - GEO (few cycles): 60% DOD
  - LEO (many cycles): 30% DOD
- Total battery capacity needed:
  \[
  C_r = \frac{P_e T_e}{DOD \cdot n}
  \]
- where \( n \approx 90\% \) is the battery efficiency

Example: DOD=60%, we get 987.65Whr which assuming 50Whr/kg weigh 19.75kg
