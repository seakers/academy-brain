Propulsion Requirements and Key Parameters for Earth Satellites

• ΔV: From ΔV budget. Drives total mass and cost.
• Thrust (F, in Newton), a measure of agility, which dictates how quickly a maneuver can be performed.
• Specific impulse (I_sp in seconds): A measure of fuel efficiency of the propulsion system, namely the thrust it can provide for a given propellant burn rate \(\dot{m}\)
\[ I_{sp} \equiv \frac{F}{\dot{m} g_0}, \text{ where } g_0 = 9.80 \, \text{m/s}^2 \]
• Minimum impulse bit: The smallest amount of delta V the system can provide (a measure of controllability)
• Burn time
• Storage time, mission lifetime
• Thrust-to-weight ratio (important for rockets but not really for satellites)
• Influential cost drivers
  • Dry mass
  • Apogee kick motor
• Others
  • Safety and security (e.g., toxicity of the propellants)
  • Mass, power, volume, cost…
  • Reliability, design lifetime
