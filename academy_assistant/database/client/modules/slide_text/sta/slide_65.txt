**Thermal control technologies**

- **Doublers**
  - Passive aluminum plates that increase heat exchange surface area
- **Heat pipes**
  - Transport heat from source to sink using evaporation and condensation of a fluid
- **Thermoelectric coolers**
  - Electrical current induces cooling of junction of 2 different materials
- **Cryocoolers**
  - Use thermodynamic (e.g., Stirling) cycle (careful with vibrations!)
  - Or just cryogenic liquids
