Slide text:
- Structures are not rigid bodies – they deform under stress
- They can be modeled as spring-mass-damper systems.
- Most simple model (ignores damping):
\[ m\ddot{x} + kx = F(t) \]
- Solving homogeneous equation in Laplace domain (s = jω), we get:
\[ ms^2X(s) + kX(s) = 0; \]
\[ x(t) = A \cos \omega t \]
\[ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \]
- This is the fundamental (lowest) natural frequency
- For K, M matrices we get
\[ |K - \omega^2 M| = 0 \] (eigenvalue problem)
