Basic solar array sizing

- Compute power density at EOL considering cell degradation over time
  \[
  P_{EOL} = P_{BOL}(1 - D)^t \left[ \frac{W}{m^2} \right]
  \]
  - \( D \) is the degradation of performance of the solar cells per unit time (e.g. \( D \approx 3\%/year \) for Si, 0.5%/yr for triple junction).
  - \( t \) is the spacecraft design lifetime (e.g., 5 years)

- Estimate required solar array area
  \[
  A_{sa} = \frac{P_{sa}}{P_{EOL}} [m^2]
  \]
