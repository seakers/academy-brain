- Ensures that all loads receive the voltage and current they need
- Main functions:
  - Voltage converter: Generate all necessary voltages from main bus voltage (e.g. 55V, 28V, 12V, 5V) typically using DC-DC converters
  - Power regulator: Ensure voltage and current levels are constant over time to avoid equipment damage
  - Power distribution: Wiring needed to bring power to equipment
  - Excess power disposal: Dispose of excess power generated by solar arrays (e.g., using shunts)
  - Fault protection: Isolate power lines of components so that a problem in one component doesnâ€™t affect other components (e.g., switches, relays, circuit breakers)
- Usually about 20-30% of power subsystem mass
