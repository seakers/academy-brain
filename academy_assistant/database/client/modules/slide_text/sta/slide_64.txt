Thermal control technologies

- Electric heaters
  - Essentially resistors that produce heat through Joule effect
  - Controlled by thermostats

- Radiators
  - Heat exchanger on outer surface to radiate excess heat into cold space

- Louvres
  - Shield radiator surfaces to moderate heat flow to space

- Cold plates
  - To cool down electronics
  - May use fluids for convective heat transfer
