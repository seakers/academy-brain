Delta V budget

- The main function of the propulsion system is to impart the necessary $\Delta V$ to achieve mission success.
- The $\Delta V$ budget provides the breakdown of the total necessary $\Delta V$.
- The $\Delta V$ budget is the main driving requirement for the propulsion system.
- Typical $\Delta V$ budget for Earth-based satellites include:
  - Orbit insertion (correct for launch vehicle injection errors)
  - Orbit transfers (e.g., from a Geostationary Transfer Orbit to GEO)
  - Deployment (e.g., space out satellites evenly within the orbital plane)
  - Orbit maintenance/station keeping
    - Raising orbit to compensate for drag
    - Staying in orbital slot in GEO
    - Maintaining specialized orbits (e.g., SSO)
  - Attitude control (e.g., for large/fast attitude maneuvers and desaturation of reaction wheels)
  - Evasive maneuvers
  - Deorbiting
