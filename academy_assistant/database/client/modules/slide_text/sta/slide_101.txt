Estimating avionics requirements

1. List all **applications and functions** allocated to the computer
2. Estimate **memory space** needed
   - Either by analogy or bottom-up estimate
3. Estimate **throughput**
   - Determine the frequency of execution of each function (execs/s)
   - Estimate \#instructions per execution for each function
   - Multiply by \#cycles per instruction (for each function)
   - Sum for all functions
4. List all utility functions, determine OS requirements
   - Determine requirement for concurrent processes, interrupts, RT tasks
5. Determine margins for growth / spare capacity
