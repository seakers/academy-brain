Design process

3. Functionally partition and allocate the computational requirements
   • Consider the following areas to allocate functions:
     • Space or ground, payload, spacecraft bus (avionics, other sub-systems)
     • Distinguish between hardware and software requirements

4. Evaluate internal and external interfaces
   • Determine Input/Output requirements for the avionics subsystem with respect to the other subsystems and payload

5. Select the baseline architecture
   • Centralized or distributed processing
   • If distributed, what type?
   • Need redundancy?

6. Form the baseline system specification
   • Detailed design
   • IA&T strategy
