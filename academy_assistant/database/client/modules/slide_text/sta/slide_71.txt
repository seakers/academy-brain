Modulations

- Information between satellite and ground station is transmitted by changing some property (amplitude, frequency or phase) of a high-frequency carrier signal \( c(t) \) in a way that encodes the information in the message \( m(t) \).
  - This is called modulation.

- Why do we need modulation? Why canâ€™t we just transmit our low frequency train of pulses (bits) \( m(t) \)?
  - Low frequency signals are reflected off the ionosphere
  - Low frequency signals would require extremely large antennas
