Buckling

- Buckling is a failure mode of a structure due to a dynamic instability.
  - Affects slender structures under a compressive stress \( P \)
  - Sudden sideways deflection \( w \)

- Deflection of a beam \( w \) is related to its bending moment \( M \)
  \[
  M = -EI \frac{d^2 w}{dx^2}
  \]
  - \( M \) is bending moment \([Nm]\)
  - \( w \) is the deflection or vertical displacement \([m]\)
  - \( E \) is Young’s modulus \([Pa]\)
  - \( I \) is area moment of inertia \([m^4]\)

- \( M = Pw \) for a beam with pinned end. From there, we can compute Euler’s critical load (elastic buckling):
  \[
  P_c = \frac{\pi^2 EI}{L'^2} \quad [N]
  \]
  - \( L' = KL \) is the effective length
  - \( K \) here is not stiffness but rather effective length factor, driven by boundary conditions (pinned, fixed), varies between 0.5-2 (1 for pinned)
