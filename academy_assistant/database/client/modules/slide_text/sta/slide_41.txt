**ADCS components**

- **Actuators**
  - Momentum wheels
  - Reaction wheels
  - Control Moment Gyros
  - Magnetic Torquers
  - Thrusters
- Choice driven by control accuracy requirement and torque needs from slewing (agility) requirements, disturbance torques

- **Sensors: Often a combination of**
  - Sun sensors: Need sunlight, mostly for sun-oriented S/C or insertion/contingency modes.
  - Star sensors/trackers: Highest accuracy (<0.01deg), most typical
  - Horizon sensors: Mostly for Earth-pointing S/C or insertion/contingency modes (~0.1deg acc.)
  - Magnetometers: Cheap and reliable, ~1deg acc.
  - IMU: Precise but suffer from drift so need external reference
  - GPS: Mostly for navigation but also attitude through differential GPS
