Module: Spacecraft Technologies and Architectures
Slide Number: 30
Slide text:
- Spacecraft mass and shape drives the **moments of inertia**, which captures the distribution of mass around the center of mass.
  - More massive spacecraft have higher moments of inertia
  - Spacecraft with mass concentrated along a certain direction can have dissimilar inertias for each axis
- Moment of inertia dictates how much torque is needed to achieve a certain angular acceleration
  - Higher moments of inertia $\Rightarrow$ larger actuators
- They also drive the natural stability of the spacecraft
- Example: symmetrical spacecraft (e.g., sphere or cube) donâ€™t suffer (or benefit) from gravity gradient disturbance torques
