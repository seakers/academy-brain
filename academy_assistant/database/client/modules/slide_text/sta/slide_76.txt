RF Link Budget Equation

• The link budget equation is the fundamental relationship driving the design of the communications architecture
• It links together the requirements (data rate, BER, spectral efficiency) with the main design parameters of both the satellite TT&C subsystem and the ground segment:
    • How big should the antennas be?
    • How much power should we transmit?
    • How much noise can we accept on the receiver?
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_t G_t G_r L_a L_l \lambda^2}{(4 \pi R)^2 k T R_b} > \frac{E_b}{N_0}_{\text{min}} \quad (\text{BER}, \eta)
\]
• Note that this is a single equation linking 9 parameters, so there are multiple possible combinations of values that can satisfy the requirements
