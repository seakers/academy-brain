Antennas – Types of antennas

• Antennas are circuits (wires, apertures) that interact with EM waves by transforming electrical fields into currents (and vice-versa)
• There are different types of antennas
    • Wire antennas (dipoles)
    • Apertures (e.g. parabolic, patch)
    • Others (e.g. helical, Yagi)
• An omni-directional antenna radiates isotropically in all directions, but most antennas are directional, i.e., the intensity of the radiated power depends on the direction.
• Antennas are important for communications but also for remote sensing (radiometers, radars, and even telescopes are antennas!)
