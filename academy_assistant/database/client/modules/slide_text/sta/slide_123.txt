Mass storage

• Hard Drives
  • Operation: Mechanical/magnetic rotating discs
  • Most common available technology; largest storage capacities (>200GB)
  • Concerns: reliability, angular momentum, and vibration

• Magnetic/optical/digital tapes
  • Operation: Rotating mechanical system
  • Highly reliable data storage
  • Stack structure (First in, last out) leads to slow data access
    • Normally not useful for operating system or programs
  • Concerns: momentum, start/stop torques, vibration

• Bubble memory (old)
  • Operation: Solid state, non-volatile, no moving parts
    • Patterns in magnetic permalloy and rotating magnetic field cause bubbles to move under read/write head
  • Persists in a magnetic bias field
  • Concerns: high mass, power dissipation, unwanted magnetic fields
