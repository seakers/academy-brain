Memories

- Read Only Memory (ROM)
  - **Not volatile**: data remains regardless of power or reset
  - **Slow write**, interfaces to CPU only for read purposes
  - Usually dedicated to “firmware” - software that will not change
  - Can be re-programmed with special instructions/voltages

- Random Access Memory (RAM)
  - **Volatile**: data is lost when power is removed and/or after a reset
  - **Fastest** memory available (over 1000MHz)

- Non-Volatile Random Access Memory (NVRAM)
  - **Non-volatile**
  - Between ROM & RAM **mid-speed memory** which can be easily read and written
  - Usually stores “software/firmware” that is expected to be updated, but otherwise does not change during normal operations
  - Most common type is **flash** memory (very common in recent space applications)
