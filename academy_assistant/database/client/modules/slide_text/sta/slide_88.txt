Module: Spacecraft Technologies and Architectures
Slide Number: 88
Slide text:
- Vibration loads are often the cause of structural failures for what we call secondary structures (appendages) and tertiary structures (avionics, etc.)
- Vibrations at different frequencies are seen during launch
  - Sine, up to 100Hz or so
  - Acoustic, up to ~10kHz
  - Shocks, up to 10kHz+
- Some frequencies see higher loads than others.
- Vibration environment often provided in terms of $g$ for sine, power spectral density ($g^2/Hz$) for higher frequencies.
