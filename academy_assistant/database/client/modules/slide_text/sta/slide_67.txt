The TT&C subsystem

- The TT&C subsystem has three main functions that drive requirements:
    1. Send payload data to ground (mission)
    2. Send spacecraft data (e.g. health, position, attitude) to ground (operations)
    3. Receive commands from ground (operations)
- To accomplish these functions, the TT&C subsystem consists of:
    - Antennas
    - Transceivers (oscillators, mixers, filters, amplifiers...)
