ADCS requirements

- The driving requirement for the ADCS are typically pointing accuracy and agility
- Pointing accuracy is the accuracy with which the spacecraft can determine or control its attitude
  - Can be different requirement for determination (knowledge) vs control. For example, itâ€™s ok to point a bit off as long as I know where I am pointing
  - Can be different for different axes
  - Pointing accuracy is a cost driver because highly accurate sensors such as star trackers and actuators such as control moment gyros are expensive
- Agility is a measure of how quickly the satellite can change its attitude.
- Example: 60 deg in 30 seconds
  - Agility is very operationally desirable for IS&R missions
  - Agility is a cost driver because high agility requires large and expensive actuators such as control moment gyros
- Other requirements
  - Jitter: Amplitude and spectral characteristics of high-frequency variations
  - Drift: Limits on low-frequency variations
  - Transient response: Max settling time or overshoot for slew maneuvers
  - Range: Angular motions over which other requirements must be met
  - Reliability
