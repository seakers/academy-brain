Types of propulsion systems

- The main choices for spacecraft propulsion systems are chemical propulsion vs electrical propulsion.
  - In chemical propulsion, the energy comes from the molecular bonds of the propellant
  - In electrical propulsion, the energy typically comes from accelerating particles through electromagnetic fields

- In general, chemical propulsion provides higher thrust but is less efficient than electric propulsion (i.e. it requires more propellant for the same Delta V)
