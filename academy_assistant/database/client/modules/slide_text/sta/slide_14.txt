Power generation technologies

• Most Earth satellites use solar panels as the primary source of power since they are affordable and sunlight is widely available.
• Rockets use primary batteries
• Distant exploration satellites with stringent power requirements must use other power sources
    • Nuclear reactors
    • Radioisotopes


The slide also contains an image titled "Power Source Comparison" with a graph comparing different power sources (Chemical, Solar, Nuclear Reactor, Radioisotope) based on electric power and time at power.
