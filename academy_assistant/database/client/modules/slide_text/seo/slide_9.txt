Vacuum â€“ Outgassing

- **Outgassing** is the release of gas that was trapped in some material
  - adhesives, insulators, thermal coating, electrical shields
- Vacuum facilitates outgassing due to decreased sublimation and evaporation points.
- Outgassed material tends to condense onto cooler surfaces.
  - Optical elements, radiators, solar cells
- Reaction with UV radiation results in dark stains that may affect performance of instruments or solar panels.
- Some materials outgas more than others in vacuum (e.g., Cd, Zn, Mg, paints, etc.)
- Spacecraft manufacturers have lists of low outgassing materials
