Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 19
Slide text:
- In summary, the total dose of radiation comes from:
  - Sunlight (mostly UV photons)
  - Solar flares (EUV and X-rays)
  - Solar wind (low energy protons)
  - CME (medium-high energy protons)
  - Radiation belt (protons and electrons)
  - Galactic Cosmic Rays (relativistic heavy nuclei)
- Spacecraft must shield against this radiation
  - Ex: Thick layer of aluminum, or water for human spaceflight.
- The more total radiation dose expected during the missionâ€™s lifetime, the thicker the layer of aluminum must be.
