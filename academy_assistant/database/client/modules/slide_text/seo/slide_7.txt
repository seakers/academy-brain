Atmospheric drag â€“ Orbit/attitude disturbance

- We care about atmospheric density mostly because it affects the drag (D) seen by the satellite, which may lead to orbital decay and disturbance torques.

\[ D = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_D A \]

  - \(\rho\) is the atmospheric density (varies exponentially but very small in orbit)
  - \(C_D\) is the drag coefficient (~2-4 are typical values for spacecraft)
  - \(V\) is the orbital velocity
  - \(A\) is the drag area

- Atmospheric drag is strong up to ~500km, negligible after that
  - A CubeSat at 400km has a lifetime of 1-9 months
  - A CubeSat at 600km has a lifetime over 25 years
