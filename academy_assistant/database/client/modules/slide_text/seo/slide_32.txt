Orbit perturbations – Effect of J2

- In the absence of any perturbations, the orbital parameters \(a, e, I, \omega, \Omega\) would stay constant over time
  - The orientation of the orbital plane would stay “fixed” independent of the motion of the Earth

- In reality, the plane rotates over time primarily because the Earth is not a perfect sphere.
  - This is nodal precession, a change in RAAN over time \(\dot{\Omega} \neq 0\)
  - The Earth’s shape is modeled using spherical harmonics with many coefficients terms
  - The largest coefficient is the oblateness of the Earth which is captured by the so-called \(J_2\) parameter

- Rate of nodal precession is different for different orbits:
  \[
  \dot{\Omega} = -\frac{3}{2(1-e^2)^2} n \frac{J_2 (R_E)^2}{a^2} \cos i
  \]
  - Where \(n = \frac{2\pi}{T}\) is called the mean motion

- \(J_2\) also causes the argument of the perigee to rotate within the orbital plane \(\dot{\omega} \neq 0\), which is called apsidal precession
