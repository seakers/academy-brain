Slide text:
- Average total solar irradiance (energy per unit time and area) is about 1366 W/m\(^2\)
- However, there are periodic variations on the order of \(\pm 0.5 \, \text{W/m}^2\)
- These fluctuations have a period of ~11 years (solar cycle)
- Can be observed through variations in solar spots
- Thus, the timing of launch within solar cycle affects atmospheric drag and amount of radiation
