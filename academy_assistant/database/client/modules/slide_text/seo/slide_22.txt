Module: Space Environments And Orbits

- Spacecraft Thermal Environment
  - Spacecraft receive heat from
    - the Sun (direct and reflected off Earth),
    - the Earth,
    - internal sources (e.g., electronics)
  - Variations in these contributions along a spacecraft’s orbit can result in fast and extreme temperature changes
    - When a spacecraft has large surface areas directly exposed to the Sun, it can get pretty hot
    - When a spacecraft is behind Earth (there is no sunlight), we say it is in eclipse – it gets cold pretty quickly
  - To manage this heat, spacecraft rely primarily on radiation
    - No convection in space (e.g., heat doesn’t rise)
  - To control radiation, spacecraft often use coatings such as paints and thermal insulators with radiative properties specially designed for the mission
    - More on this in the spacecraft subsystems module!
