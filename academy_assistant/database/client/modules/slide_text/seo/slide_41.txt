Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 41
Slide text:
- The Molniya orbit is very common in satellites from northern regions (e.g., Russia)
- 12h period
- Highly elliptical orbit spends most of time over apogee
- Special high inclination of 63.4 deg is such that there is no apsidal precession (frozen apogee)
- Thus, the satellite spends ~11h a day moving very slowly over a certain northern region that is always the same
- Useful for communications and regional coverage in high-latitude countries like Russia
