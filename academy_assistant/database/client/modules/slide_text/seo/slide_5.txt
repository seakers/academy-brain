"Microgravity"

- Objects are in “free fall”, not absence of gravity!
  - Gravity compensated by centrifugal force due to orbital speed
- Near absence of gravity (~$10^{-6}$ g) means that:
  - Objects don’t fall
  - Bubbles don’t rise
  - Particles don’t settle in a solution
  - No convection (eliminates an important heat transfer mechanism!)
- This presents challenges, mostly for astronauts…
  - Bone loss
  - Muscle loss
  - Cardiovascular problems
  - Immune system
- …but also opportunities
  - Formation of large crystals
- The effects on traditional Earth satellites are relatively benign (e.g., lower structural stresses when in orbit)
