Position of a satellite within its orbit

- The true anomaly $\theta$ is an angle that defines where within the orbit the satellite is at a given point in time
- There are two special points:
  - the perigee is the point where it is closest to the Earth
  - The apogee is the point where it is farthest from the Earth
- Given $a$, $e$ and $\theta$ we can compute the satellite position $r$, i.e., the distance between the satellite and Earth:
  \[
  r(\theta) = \frac{a(1 - e^2)}{1 + e \cos \theta}
  \]

- For example, the distance to the perigee ($\theta = 0^\circ$) is $r_p = a(1 - e)$
- The distance to the apogee and apogee ($\theta = 180^\circ$) is $r_a = a(1 + e)$
