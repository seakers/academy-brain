Solar Radiation – Light, matter, and fields

- Explosions in the Sun’s atmosphere produce both
  - Light (photons)
  - And matter (charged particles, such as ions and electrons)
- This becomes radiation from the Sun
- Solar flares are huge bursts of photons in all wavelengths but mostly X-rays and extreme UV (EUV)
  - \( E \sim 10^{25} \)
- Coronal Mass Ejections (CME) are made of particles (ions and electrons) ejected at very high speeds (solar wind)
  - From 0.2-3 CME/day
  - \(\sim 500 \, \text{km/s} \, (\sim 3 \, \text{days to get to Earth})\)
  - \(\sim 10 \, \text{protons/cm}^3\)
