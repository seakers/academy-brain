Types of orbital maneuvers

• In-plane maneuvers:
  • $\Delta V$ in the orbital plane
  • Typically to raise $a$, can also change $e$, $\omega$
  • Burn in the direction of $\vec{V}$ (tangential) for max efficiency
  • Examples: Hohmann transfer

• Out-of-plane maneuvers:
  • $\Delta V$ has a component outside of the orbital plane
  • typically to change $i$ or $\Omega$
  • Example: Simple plane change, Combined plane change

• Out-of-plane maneuvers are usually much more expensive than in plane maneuvers
