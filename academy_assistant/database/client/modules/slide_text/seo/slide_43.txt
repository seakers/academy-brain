How to choose an orbit

- Local time of Ascending Node
  - Usually no effect on launch cost (can be set through launch time)
  - Very high energy active instruments go in dawn-dusk (DD) SSO orbits to maximize sunlight
  - Visible and near-infrared (VNIR) passive instruments can’t be in low-light orbits (e.g., DD)
  - Chemistry orbits prefer PM local times since that’s max time for pollution

- Repeat ground track requirements restrict possibilities to a few options

- Finally, there might also be legacy constraints
  - A-Train: SSO 700km PM
  - Landsat: SSO 800km AM
