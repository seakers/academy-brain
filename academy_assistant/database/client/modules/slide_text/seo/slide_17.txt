Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 17
Slide text:
- The Van Allen Belts are 2 regions of trapped fast charged particles (electrons and protons)
  - Inner belt: 1,000-6,000km altitude
  - Outer belt: 13,000-60,000km
- Most LEO satellites are below the 1st ring (inner belt) so they have a more benign radiation environment
- MEO satellites are in the middle of the 2nd ring (outer belt) so they see more radiation (e.g., GPS satellites)
- GEO satellites are in the edge of the outer belt (radiation also a problem)
- The South Atlantic Anomaly is a range of longitudes where the Earthâ€™s magnetic field is weaker and thus radiation is worse. Leads to more radiation-related spacecraft failures.
