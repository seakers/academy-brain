Slide Number: 8
Slide text: 
- In the upper layers of the atmosphere the predominant constituent is (O), formed by photodissociation of \(O_2\)
  \[
  O_2 + \text{light} \rightarrow O + O
  \]
- Highly reactive and energetic
- It erodes satellite surfaces (Teflon, epoxies, Mylar)
- Surfaces can be protected by coating them with something that is "immune" to O:
  - Silicon dioxide
  - Aluminum
