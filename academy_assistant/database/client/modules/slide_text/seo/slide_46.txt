- What are spacecraft maneuvers?
  - Spacecraft are never “stopped”. They are always moving in space at very fast speeds.
  - Spacecraft maneuvers are changes to the spacecraft speed and direction that result in a new spacecraft orbit (i.e. new orbital parameters)
  - Orbital maneuvers are necessary for many operational reasons:
    - Station keeping (e.g, raise altitude to compensate for atmospheric drag, stay within your allotted GEO slot)
    - Get closer to another spacecraft (e.g., for docking or inspection)
    - Observe a region of Earth sooner or more frequently
    - Provide better coverage (e.g., comms) of a given region
  - To do an orbital maneuver, a thruster applies a certain amount of force (thrust) for a certain duration (burn time) in a certain direction.
  - This results in consumption of some amount of fuel or propellant.
