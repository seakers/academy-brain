Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 37
Slide text:
- **Geosynchronous**: Period is exactly equal to 1 Earth's day
- **Geostationary**: Geosynchronous + equatorial (i=0)
- **A geostationary satellite maintains nearly fixed position with respect to Earth (stays above a given region)**
- For geostationary, the ground track is a point.
- For geosynchronous with \(i, e > 0\) it is an analemma (a figure "8").
- Applications: communications, regional weather, IS&R
- Very special and thus very congested orbit
