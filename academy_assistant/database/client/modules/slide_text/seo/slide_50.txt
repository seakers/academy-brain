- Rendez-vous is a maneuver by which two spacecraft change their orbits to get close enough to one another that they can dock â€“ establish a physical interface between them
- Typically, an interceptor spacecraft changes its orbit to dock with (intercept) a target spacecraft.
- Maneuver consists of one or multiple burns to adjust semimajor axis and thus period to reduce phase angle followed by another burn to equalize the semimajor axis.
