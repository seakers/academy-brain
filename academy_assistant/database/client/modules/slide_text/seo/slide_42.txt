How to choose an orbit – Earth observing mission

• A compromise between requirements from all instruments and cost
• Cost:
  • launch cost
  • Bus cost through power available, $\Delta V$ budget
• Altitude
  • Higher altitude means higher $\Delta V$ budget and higher launch cost
  • High altitude for passive instruments, low altitude for very high energy instruments or in situ measurements
  • Higher altitude means better coverage and revisit time
  • Lower altitude means better spatial resolution and SNR
  • Below 500km, drag is a problem (lifetime, ADCS)
• Inclination
  • Greater inclination change from launch latitude means higher $\Delta V$ budget and higher launch cost
  • SSO are useful to ensure constant illumination
  • SSO are avoided when we want to sample diurnal cycle (e.g., oceanography to avoid tidal aliasing)
  • True polar when we want optimal coverage of the poles (e.g., high latitudes, geodetic satellites)
  • Lower inclinations to improve coverage of region of interest (e.g., tropics)
