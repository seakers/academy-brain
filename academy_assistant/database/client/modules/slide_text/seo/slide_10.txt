Slide Number: 10
Slide text: 
- The Earth has a magnetic field
  - Protects us from radiation
  - Generates forces that rotate spacecraft (can be leveraged using magnetic torquers)
- Magnetic field lines points from magnetic south to north
  - Different from geographic equator and poles
- Intensity decreases with distance as \(1/r^3\)
- Max at the magnetic equator, min at the magnetic poles
