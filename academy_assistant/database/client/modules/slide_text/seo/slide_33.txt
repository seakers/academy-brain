Orbit perturbations

• Another major orbit perturbation for very low Earth orbits is atmospheric drag which creates orbital decay below 600km

• There are several other sources of orbit perturbations:
    • 3rd body effects (Moon and Sun) Solar radiation pressure
    • Other harmonics (J4, J6), other planets, albedo, tidal effects, ...

• Magnitude of each depends strongly on altitude, but J2 is often strongest

• Example:
    • For a satellite at 300km, drag is as strong as J2 (really dominates)
    • At 800km, J2 dominates
    • At 36,000km, the Sun/Moon effects are as strong as J2

• Because of all these perturbations, spacecraft use propellant to keep their orbit parameters constant
    • This is called station-keeping


Equation:

\text{Figure 3.1. Central acceleration and perturbative accelerations as a function of the distance r of the satellite from the centre of the Earth, shown on a log-log scale. Over the ranges considered, the curves can be approximated as straight lines with gradients as noted. The altitudes of the three types of satellite have also been indicated.}
