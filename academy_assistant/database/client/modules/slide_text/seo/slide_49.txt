Deorbiting

- Due to the space debris problem, NASA has a recommendation to deorbit a satellite after its lifetime in less than 25 years
  - Now more modern guidelines from FCC with 5 years

- Deorbiting strategies:
  - If LEO, burn inward, decrease altitude (or perigee) to <300km
  - If GEO/MEO, burn outward, increase altitude by 100km to a "graveyard orbit"

- Impact on spacecraft design:
  - Must have a propulsion system on board or stay below a certain max altitude
  - Must account for deorbiting delta V
