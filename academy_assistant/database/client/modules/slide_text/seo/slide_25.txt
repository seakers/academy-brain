Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 25
Slide text:
- Satellite orbits are generally ellipses
- The Earth (or central body) sits in one of the focus points
- An ellipse is usually defined by 2 parameters:
  - The semimajor axis \( a \) is half the length of the longer axis
    - Increasing \( a \) make the orbit "bigger", further from Earth
  - The eccentricity \( e \) tells us how elongated the ellipse is
    - When \( e = 0 \), the ellipse becomes a perfect circle
- Together, \( a, e \) define the shape of the orbit
