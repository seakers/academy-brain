Ground tracks

- The ground track is the projection of the position of satellite on the Earth's surface (lat, lon) over time
  - They are a useful visualization of an orbit since they show which regions are "seen"
- Can infer orbital parameters from ground tracks
  - Inclination from max latitude
  - Period (and thus semimajor axis) from equatorial orbit shift between consecutive tracks
