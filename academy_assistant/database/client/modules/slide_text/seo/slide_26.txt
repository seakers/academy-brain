Conic sections, open vs closed orbits

• More generally, orbital trajectories can follow the shape of any conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola)
• Circular and elliptical orbits (0 ≤ e < 1) are “closed orbits” around the Earth
• A satellite with sufficient energy (e ≥ 1) will escape Earth and follow an interplanetary trajectory that never comes back (i.e., “open orbits”)
    • When e = 1, it follows a parabolic trajectory
    • When e > 1 it follows a hyperbolic trajectory


Equations:
- Hyperbola:
  \[
  \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
  \]
  \[
  r = \frac{ep}{1 - e \cos \theta}
  \]

- Parabola:
  \[
  y^2 = 4ax
  \]
  \[
  r = \frac{2a}{1 - \cos \theta}
  \]
