Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 40
Slide text: 
- Certain orbits are such that an integer number \( n \) of orbital periods corresponds exactly to an integer number \( k \) of days
- The ground tracks of these special orbits repeat exactly every \( k \) days
- Many Earth Observation satellites are repeat ground track SSO orbits
- There are not that many combinations of those, especially for low repeat cycles!
- Example: There is only 1 1-day repeat cycle orbit between 300 and 700km for which: 560km, whose period equals exactly 15 orbital revolutions per day.
