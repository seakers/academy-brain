Module: Space Environments And Orbits
Slide Number: 12
Slide text: 
- Electromagnetic radiation is carried by waves and massless particles (named photons) that travel at the speed of light
- Waves are periodic.
  - Wavelength is the distance between consecutive peaks
  - Frequency is the time interval between consecutive peaks
- Frequency \( f \) and wavelength \( \lambda \) are related by the speed of light \( c \)
  \[
  f = \frac{c}{\lambda}
  \]
- Energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency through the Planck constant
  \[
  E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
  \]
