Slide text: 
- In Sun-synchronous orbits, \(a\) and \(i\) are carefully chosen so that nodal precession matches the Earth rotation around the Sun
- Angle between Sun-Earth vector and the orbital plane stays constant all year
- Consequently, for a given latitude, observations are all made at the same local solar time (called Local Time of the Ascending Node or LTAN)
- Choice of LTAN matters
  - E.g., dawn-dusk minimizes eclipses but not a lot of light
- Very common for Earth observation since it makes illumination conditions constant
