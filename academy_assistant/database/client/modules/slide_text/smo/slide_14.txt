Module: Space Mission Overview
Slide Number: 14
Slide text:
- The space segment consists of one or more spacecraft
- Each spacecraft consists of
  - A payload: the instrument(s) that collect(s) the mission data (e.g., cameras, radars)
  - A spacecraft bus: the platform that provides power, communications, propulsion, attitude control, and other support to the payload.
- Each spacecraft is put into an orbit, which is the trajectory they follow around a planetary body (e.g., Earth)

Choice of payload and orbit drive the design of the spacecraft bus and therefore drive space segment cost.
