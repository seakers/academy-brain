Data Delivery

• Space vs ground processing
    • Instrument data received and expensive data processing algorithms are done to filter, calibrate, convert to physical units, and bin the data into images.
    • Which of those do we do on-board?

• Centralized vs distributed processing:
    • One computer vs. Multiple-dedicated computers?
    • Decoupling good for performance, risk, and testing but increases cost

• Level of autonomy: from 100% manual to 100% automatic.

• All of these decisions are interrelated.
