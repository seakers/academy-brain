Earth Observation

• Various purposes
  • Weather satellites
  • IS&R satellites
  • Earth science satellites
• Payloads
  • Spectral region: optical (visible, infrared) or microwave
  • Spectral content: single-band, multi-spectral, hyper-spectral
  • Illumination: active (e.g. radars and lidars) or passive (optical imagers)
  • Visible imagers offer high resolution (sub-meter) but can’t see during night or through clouds
  • Thermal imagers work over night but typically offer reduced spatial resolution (meters to tens of meters)
  • Radars have day-night and all weather capability and typically have resolutions of tens-hundreds of meters (synthetic aperture radar)
