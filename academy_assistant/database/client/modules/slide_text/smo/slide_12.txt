Module: Space Mission Overview
Slide Number: 12
Slide text: 
- Using Parametric Cost Modeling, cost of a system dependent on certain factors (ie. mass, aperture, average power) can be calculated using CERs
  - Example: Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation CERs
    - Each component cost can be estimated based on the parameter \(X\), these are often power functions
- The Mission must be separated into different elements for accurate cost approximation
