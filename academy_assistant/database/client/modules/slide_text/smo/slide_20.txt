Transfer to operational orbit
Orbit insertion (hours to weeks)

Payload testing and calibration

Acquire images, send down to Earth, perform station-keeping maneuvers, software updates. May include nominal orbital changes.
Nominal operations (~3-10 years)

If there is extra funding for ops, extend operations for current or new goals, in same or different orbit.
Extended operations (0-10 years)

Reentry and burn through Earth's atmosphere or move into "graveyard" orbit
