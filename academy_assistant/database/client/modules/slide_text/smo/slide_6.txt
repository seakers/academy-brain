Space is expensive. Why?

- Getting to space without falling right back is difficult
- Rockets are inefficient
- Space environment is harsh
- Small markets – unique parts
- Labor-intensive
- Need for high reliability and “Space Spiral”
- Some of this is changing with the recent push for distributed space architectures but still.

Fewer missions → Higher reliability → Higher cost → Longer schedule → Fewer missions
