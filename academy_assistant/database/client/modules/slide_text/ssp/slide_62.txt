Received Power: Costs

- Complexity due to interferences:
  - Variations in emissivity require sophisticated calibration, adding to mission complexity and cost
  - Atmospheric conditions such as humidity and temperature affect signal quality, necessitating proper corrections
  - Environmental surface roughness and nearby vegetation scatters, reflects, and absorbs transmitted signals, reducing the intended received power
