Slide text:
- Integration time is an important characteristic of an imaging system because it affects SNR. The longer the integration time, the better the SNR.
- For pushbroom sensors, the integration time $\tau$ is determined by ground velocity $V_g = \frac{R_E}{R_E + h} \cdot V$ and along-track pixel size $\Delta y$
  \[
  \tau = \frac{\Delta y}{V_g}
  \]
  - Example: $\Delta y = 250m, V_g = 6620m/s, \tau = 37.8ms$
- It is also common to enforce some overlap $O$ between consecutive swaths, which decreases $\Delta y$ (use $\Delta y / O$ instead) and therefore integration time.
