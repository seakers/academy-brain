MW Receivers

- Receivers in MW remote sensing instruments are antennas that measure some property of the incoming EM radiation:
  - Intensity (total power radiometer)
  - Arrival time (radar)
  - Doppler (Doppler radar)
  - Phase (interferometric radar)

- Incoming wave:
  \[
  E = \frac{|E_0|}{r} e^{-i(kr - \omega t)} \quad \text{(spherical EM wave)}
  \]

- The main components of receivers are:
  - Amplifiers (increase the intensity of the signal)
  - Filters (remove certain frequencies, band-pass, low-pass)
  - Local oscillators
  - Mixers (multiply by \(\cos \omega t\))
