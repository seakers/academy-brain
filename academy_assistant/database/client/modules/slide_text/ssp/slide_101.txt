Optional: Focused vs unfocused SAR

- In order to achieve the full capability of the synthetic array, each received echo must be phase-shifted to take into account the difference in distance between the target and the sensor
- To focus on point \(X_i\), this phase difference is \(\phi_i = 2k(h - r_i) = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda} (h - r_i)\)
  - This requires computing the phase for each point \(X_i \rightarrow\) focused SAR
- In an unfocused SAR, we assume that phase shift corrections of less than \(\lambda/4\) can be neglected, restrict ourselves to this region, and simply do not do these calculations.
  - This is equivalent to having a smaller antenna of \(L' = \sqrt{\frac{\lambda h}{2}}\) and resolution \(X_a = \frac{\lambda h}{L'} = \sqrt{2\lambda h}\)
