Optional: Vibrational-rotational spectrum

• Molecular vibration produces an oscillating electric dipole moment that is sufficient for both vibrational and rotational transitions

• Thus, both transitions occur at the same time and the resulting energy level is the sum of the separate transition energies.

• Since the energy of the vibrational transition is much larger than that of the rotational transitions, many rotational levels are active, and the resulting spectrum is a combination of lines around the fundamental vibrational band
    • This is sometimes called the vibrational-rotational spectrum
