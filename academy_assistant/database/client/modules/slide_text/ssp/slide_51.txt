Reflection, Transmission, Scattering in Surfaces

• When an EM wave is incident on an interface between two materials (e.g. atmosphere and solid surface):
    • Some of the energy is reflected in the specular direction
    • Some of it is scattered in all directions (more on this to come)
    • Some of it is transmitted

• In most thick surfaces, transmitted energy is absorbed and re-radiated in the form of thermal emission or other processes.
