- Observations in the wings of a spectral band sense deeper into the atmosphere whereas observations in the band center see only the very top of the atmosphere.
- Each frequency has an associated weighting function that peaks at a certain altitude/pressure
- Thus, by properly selecting a set of frequencies/wavelengths, we can derive a vertical profile of temperature or concentration of sth

Spectral resolution \(\propto\) vertical spatial resolution!
