Summary

• MW radiometer:
  • Spatial resolution, swath
  • Sensitivity

• Real aperture radar
  • Pulse modulation, pulse length and bandwidth
  • Range and azimuth resolution
  • Radar equation

• Synthetic aperture radar
  • Principle of aperture synthesis (coherent combination of signals)
  • Improved azimuth resolution
