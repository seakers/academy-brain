Optional: Basic array of antennas

• When $\psi \approx 0$, signals add in phase
• As $\psi$ increases, signals start adding incoherently and the magnitude of the sum decreases
• When $\psi = \frac{2\pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, signals exactly cancel out producing a zero
  \[
  \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{Nd}
  \]
• Hence, the radiation pattern of the array is very similar to that of an aperture antenna of size $D = Nd$ and its angular resolution is approximately $\lambda / D$
• Note that beamwidth from zero to zero is $2\lambda / D$, i.e. twice the angular resolution
