From soil moisture (SM) to antenna output

- The goal of this lecture is to explain how we can do MW remote sensing (e.g., of soil moisture)
- I will take you through the journey from soil moisture \( SM \) to radiometer antenna output (voltage \( V \)) and to retrieved soil moisture \( \hat{SM} \).
- Along the way I will use a use a few key concepts:
  - Permittivity \( \epsilon_r \)
  - Emissivity \( \epsilon \)
  - Brightness temperature \( T_B \)
- And explain how a radiometer is fundamentally just an antenna with a band-pass filter and a square-law detector

\[
SM \rightarrow \epsilon_r \rightarrow n \rightarrow \rho \rightarrow \epsilon \rightarrow T_B \rightarrow P(\nu) \rightarrow V \sim T_B \rightarrow \hat{SM}
\]
