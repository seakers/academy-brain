- More specialized missions require more complex and expensive components
- The focal length, field of view, and f-number are interrelated parameters that significantly affect the cost of a satellite optical system.
  - Increasing focal length and decreasing f-number can improve image resolution and quality but at the expense of increased component sizes, system complexity, and operational costs.
  - A wider field of view can improve coverage efficiency but may reduce the effectiveness of the system for high-resolution imaging
