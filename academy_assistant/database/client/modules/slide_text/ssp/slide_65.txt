Optional: Basic intensity receiver (total power radiometer)

• \( P_R = kT_R \) is the noise added by the receiver
• Band-pass filter of bandwidth \( B \) eliminates some noise
• Square-law detector makes output (Volts) proportional to input power and thus equivalent temperature
• \( h(t) \) is an integrator with integration time \( \tau \) (smoothing)


\[
P_R = kT_R
\]

\[
v_i(t) \quad v_d(t) = v_i^2(t) \quad v_o(t) = \int_0^\infty v_d(t - \tau) h(\tau) d\tau
\]
