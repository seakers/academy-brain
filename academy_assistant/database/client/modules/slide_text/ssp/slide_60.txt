Inverse problem for soil moisture (SM)

• Inverse problem: Find SM from received power (in general, any instance of a problem where you observe \( y = \sum \omega_i f(x_i) \) and want to get one \( x_j \) from \( y \)
• In this case, there are multiple undesired sources that contribute to the received radiance:
    • Effect of the atmosphere
    • Effects of surface roughness
    • Effects of vegetation
    • Effects of solar reflected radiation
    • Effect of the antenna (coming in a few slides)


Equation:
\[ y = \sum \omega_i f(x_i) \]
