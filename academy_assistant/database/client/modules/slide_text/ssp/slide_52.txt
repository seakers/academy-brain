Reflectivity vs emissivity

- Definition: Transmissivity or transmittance ($\tau$) is the fraction of EM radiation that is transmitted at an interface.

- By conservation of energy:
$$\rho + \tau = 1$$

- Furthermore, for most thick surfaces, the transmitted radiation is absorbed and then re-emitted (conservation of energy), therefore:
$$\tau = \alpha = \epsilon = 1 - \rho$$
