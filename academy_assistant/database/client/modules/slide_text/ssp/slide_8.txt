Optional: Electronic processes: The Bohr model

• Energy of an atom can change as a result of a change in energy of its electrons
• Bohr model (simplistic model)
  • Electrons in an atom orbit the nucleus
  • They can only occupy specific orbits with quantized energy levels: \( E_1, E_2, \ldots \)
  • Electrons gain or lose energy by transitioning between orbits, accompanied by absorption or emission of photons

Equation:
\[ \Delta E = hf \]
