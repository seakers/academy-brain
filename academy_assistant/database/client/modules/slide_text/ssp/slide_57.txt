Optional: Restrahlen effect

- In other words, if wide-spectrum light is incident on a polished surface, the reflected light will contain a relatively large portion of energy around the absorption bands of the surface material.
- This is known as the Restrahlen effect and is manifested in the form of a peak in the reflectivity of a surface near an absorption feature of the material
