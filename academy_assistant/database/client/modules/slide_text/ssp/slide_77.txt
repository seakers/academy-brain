- The spectrum of the pulse plays an important role in radar.
- Consider a simple sinusoidal pulse of frequency \( f_0 \) truncated to length \( \tau \). It is easy to show that the spectrum of this signal is two sinc functions at \( \pm f_0 \) with width \( 1/\tau \).
  - Exercise: Prove this.
- When we repeat this pulse with period \( T = 1/\text{PRF} \), the fine structure (impulse train) appears with spacing \( \frac{1}{T} = \text{PRF} \).
- The bandwidth of this pulse is approximately \( B = 1/\tau \).
