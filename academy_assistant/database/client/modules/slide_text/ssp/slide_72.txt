- All fundamental vibrational modes of most common molecules (e.g. oxides of silicon, magnesium, or aluminum) occur in the TIR.
- Only a few occur in the VNIR, and by far the most common is that of OH ion (e.g. in AlOH or MgOH), which has a fundamental mode at 2.77um
- Its first overtone at 1.4um is the most common feature in the NIR spectra of terrestrial materials
