Slide text:
- The Q-factor of an optical system is given by the ratio between ground resolution limited by diffraction and GSD determined by detector size:
\[ Q = \frac{\Delta x'}{\text{GSD}} \]
- If \( Q < 1 \) then actual angular (spatial) resolution driven by detectors and GSD
- Otherwise the actual system resolution is diffraction-limited and equal to \( \Delta x' \)
- Most optical systems are designed so that \( Q \approx 1 \)
