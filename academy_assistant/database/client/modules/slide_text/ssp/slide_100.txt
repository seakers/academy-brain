Where’s the catch?

- The resolution of this antenna would be $\frac{\lambda}{2} = \frac{L}{2h}$ and the resulting ground azimuth resolution is $X_a = \frac{L}{2}$
  - Independent of h!
  - Better resolution for smaller antennas!
  - What’s going on?
- Indeed, the further the sensor, the larger the ground footprint and thus the larger the synthesized aperture.
- However, at some point, you become limited by SNR, ambiguities, and data processing abilities.
