Optional: Fundamental vibration bands

• Each mode of vibration corresponds to a different energy level and different frequency called the fundamental frequency

• Levels of vibrational energy: \( E_v = h \nu_k \left( v_k + \frac{1}{2} \right) \)
  • Where \( v_k = 1, 2, \ldots \) is the vibrational quantum number
  • \( \nu_k \) is the fundamental frequency

• Molecules may change from the ground state \( v_k = 0 \) to one of the modes \( v_k = 1 \) by absorbing photons at the mode's fundamental frequency \( \nu_k \)

• For example, \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) has 3 fundamental modes at 2.9, 3.1 and 6.08μm
  • Note these are in the SWIR
