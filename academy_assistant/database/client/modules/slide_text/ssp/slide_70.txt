Remote sensing of solid surfaces – VNIR

- In the VNIR, sensors measure **solar radiation reflected off** a surface
  - In the TIR, it’s mostly thermal emission (like microwave)
- In the absence of an atmosphere, by comparing spectrum of source to received radiation, we obtain surface reflectivity
- Surface reflectivity depends on physical and chemical properties of the surface of interest
