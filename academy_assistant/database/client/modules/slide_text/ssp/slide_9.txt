Optional: Lyman, Balmer, Paschen series

• Hydrogen atom has been studied extensively
• Certain transitions have common names:
  • Lyman series: from \( n \geq 2 \) to \( n = 1 \)
  • Balmer series: from \( n \geq 3 \) to \( n = 2 \)
  • Paschen series: from \( n \geq 4 \) to \( n = 3 \)
• These transitions fall in the UV-VIS-NIR region of the spectrum for hydrogen, but outside of UV-VIS-NIR for most common minerals
• May sometimes see these names in the characteristics of certain instruments, although mostly reserved for astrophysics
