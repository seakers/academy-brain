Optional: Overtone and combination bands: water

- Often, overtone and combination bands are observed in the VNIR instead of fundamental bands
- For example for water, there is an overtone band at 1.45um (2v_3) and a combination band at 1.9um (v_2 + v_3)
- Location and appearance of water bands when sensing solid surfaces provides useful information about how water associates with the mineral. This information can be used to infer composition
- See difference in water features for different water-bearing minerals such as gypsum, natrolite, or quartz.


Equations:
- Overtone band at 1.45um: \( 2v_3 \)
- Combination band at 1.9um: \( v_2 + v_3 \)
