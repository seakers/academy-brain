Real-aperture radar â€“ Resolution

- Ground range resolution: We project the \(\frac{c}{2B}\) onto the horizontal ground and obtain
  \[
  X_r = \frac{c}{2B \sin \theta}
  \]

- Note this is different from the cross-track resolution of a radiometer (in fact, the value below is the radar swath width in the cross-track direction):
  \[
  SW_r \approx \frac{h \lambda}{W \cos^2 \theta}
  \]
  Where \(W\) is the size of the antenna in the vertical direction (antenna height or width)

- Azimuth resolution: The ability of the radar to separate two iso-delay points is simply given by azimuth angular resolution of the antenna \(\beta = \frac{\lambda}{L}\)
  \[
  X_a \approx \frac{h}{\cos \theta} \beta = \frac{h \lambda}{L \cos \theta}
  \]
  Where \(L\) is the size of the antenna in the along-track direction (antenna length)
