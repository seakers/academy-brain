Optional: Modes of motion

- For a molecule with N atoms, there are 3N modes of motion
  - 3 translational modes
  - 3 (2 if linear) rotational modes of the molecule as a whole
  - 3N-6 (3N-5 if linear) vibrational modes
- Example: \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) has 3 atoms and is not a linear molecule. Thus it has \( 3*3-6=3 \) vibrational modes.
- Example: \( \text{CO}_2 \) has 3 atoms and is a linear molecule. Thus it has \( 3*3-5=4 \) vibrational modes
  - Although 2 are degenerate â€“ same energy
