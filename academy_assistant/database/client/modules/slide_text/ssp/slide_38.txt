Optional: Photomultiplier tubes

• Add multiple electrodes (dynodes) to increase number of electrons per photon
• At each dynode, new electrons are ejected due to secondary emission
• Thermal noise becomes negligible
• Still have noise due to dark current (from cosmic rays, thermal, etc)
• Cooling helps decrease dark current (cryocooling needed upwards of 2 – 3μm)
