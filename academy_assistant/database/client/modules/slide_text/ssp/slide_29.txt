- Swath in pushbroom imaging systems is given by FOV (i.e., by number of pixels in the array of detectors and IFOV)
\[ sw \approx 2h \tan \left( \frac{\text{FOV}}{2} \right) = 2h \tan \left( \frac{N_x \text{IFOV}}{2} \right) \]
- Swath in whiskbroom imaging systems is given by scanning angle, aka field of regard (FOR)
\[ sw \approx 2h \tan \left( \frac{\text{FOR}}{2} \right) \]
- Note: These are flat-Earth approximations. Better estimates can be obtained using formulas
- A wider swath requires more complex mechanisms increasing cost due to weight and complexity
