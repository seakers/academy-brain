Pulse modulation

[Image: Before matched filtering] [Image: After matched filtering: the echoes are shorter in time.]

• Yes! Using matched filter detection with pulse modulation, the pulse “looks shorter” at the output of the matched filter
• Thus, for pulse modulated radar and matched filter detection, range resolution depends on bandwidth of the pulse, not on pulse length!
• We can increase bandwidth without affecting length ☺ conflict solved!
