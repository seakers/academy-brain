Optics: Focal length, FOV, and F-number

- The focal length \( f \) of an optical system is the distance between the lens/mirror and the point at which all optical rays converge (focal plane).
- Focal length \( f \) and orbit altitude \( h \) define magnification \( M \), which determines the relationship between distances in the image plane (e.g., size of the image plane \( r_d \)) vs in the object plane (e.g., field of view \( R \)):

\[
\frac{r_d}{R} = M = \frac{f}{h}, \tan \left( \frac{\text{FOV}}{2} \right) = \frac{R}{h} = \frac{r_d}{f}
\]

- The F-number \( F\# \) relates the focal length to the aperture \( D \):

\[
F\# = \frac{f}{D}
\]
