Optional: Rotational processes

• Quantized rotational energy states:
    E_J = Bhc(J + 1), J ∈ Z^+
    • Where B = h/8π^2Ic is the rotational constant of the molecule (depends on inertial properties) and J is the quantum number (J=1,2,...)
• When the molecule changes from one state (quantum number) to another, it emits/absorbs a photon of frequency
    ν = 2BJ (cm^-1)
• Selection rule: ΔJ = ±1 (from quantum mechanics)
• Pure rotational processes occur in the far-infrared and microwave portion of the spectrum
