Slide text:
- Let us consider the case of N antennas separated by d and emitting \(a_n e^{i \phi_n}\). The total field from a direction \(\theta\) is proportional to
  \[
  E(\theta) \sim \sum_{n} a_n e^{i \phi_n - in kd \sin \theta}
  \]
- Assuming equal amplitudes and phases \(a_n e^{i \phi_n} = a e^{i \phi}\), we obtain
  \[
  E(\theta) \sim a e^{i \phi} \sum_{n} e^{-in kd \sin \theta}
  \]
- This sum is strongly dependent on the value of \(\psi = kd \sin \theta = \frac{2 \pi d}{\lambda} \sin \theta\).
