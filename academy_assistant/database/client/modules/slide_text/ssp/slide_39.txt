Optional: Photodiodes

• Diodes are devices that only let current in one direction (asymmetric conductance)
• However, they do have a small reverse current
• The amount of reverse current increases with light
\[ i_s(t) = \frac{\eta P_s(t)}{hf} e \]
  - \( P_s \) is incident light power (in W)
  - Quantum efficiency: \( \eta \) = 0.8-0.95 electrons per photon
• Dark current problem (current for \( P_s = 0 \) is not zero)

\[ V_0 = \left( i_{dark} + \frac{\eta P_s e}{hf} \right) R \]
