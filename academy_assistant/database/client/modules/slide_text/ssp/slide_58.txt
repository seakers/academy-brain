Optional: Rayleigh-Jeans approximation

• Today we are concerned with the MW region of the spectrum.
• While most of thermal emission of bodies at room temperature occurs in the far infrared, the emission extends into the microwave region.
• In this region, we observe that $h\nu \ll kT$ and thus the exponential term in Planck’s law can be well approximated:
\[ e^{h\nu/k_BT} \approx 1 + \frac{h\nu}{kT} + \ldots \]
• With a little algebra, we obtain:
\[ B_\nu \approx \frac{2kT}{\lambda^2} \]
\[ T_B \approx \epsilon T_{phys} \]
