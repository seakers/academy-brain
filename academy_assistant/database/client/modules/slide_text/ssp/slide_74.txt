Fundamentals of radar systems

- Radar systems deduce the range to objects, and sometimes radial velocity and shape.
  - Great for topography, geometry and physical structure
- The principle of operation is simple: radar emits a pulse of radiation, which is reflected off the target, comes back to the radar and is received.
- The round-trip delay is proportional to the range:
  \[
  \Delta t = \frac{2r}{c}
  \]
- Monostatic radar is the most common, in which the same antenna is used for transmission and reception
- If the two antennas are in different locations, it is called a bistatic radar.

Radars are usually side-looking. Can you guess why?
