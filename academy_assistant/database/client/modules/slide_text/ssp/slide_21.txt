- Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) captures images of the Earth's surface and atmosphere from nine different angles.
- MISR can distinguish features based on their angular distribution, which helps in identifying aerosols, clouds, and surface properties
- A limb sounder observes the Earth's atmosphere by looking vertically up from the limb of the Earth, which is the edge of the planet seen from space.
- This perspective allows the instrument to measure vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents, such as ozone, water vapor, and trace gases, over a broad altitude range.
