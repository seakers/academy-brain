This is what we observe with the instrument (received power)

• Inverse problems are hard to solve. Tricks to solve inverse problems:
  • Observe at different angles or frequencies and use differences and ratios for inversion to get rid of certain additive or multiplicative effects
  • Observe at certain times of day to get rid of certain dependencies (e.g. at dawn-dusk, temperature of the soil and air are almost the same)
  • Combine observations with ancillary models to estimate the unknown parameters (vegetation, roughness)
