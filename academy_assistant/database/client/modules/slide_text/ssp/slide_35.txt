Types of dispersive elements (filters)

• Goal is to separate light by wavelengths.
• 2 main mechanisms: Dispersion (n varies – usually decreases – with wavelength) and interferometry.
• Main types of dispersive elements:
    • Prism: Light from different frequencies is deviated in a different angle (n(f))
      \(\delta(\lambda) \approx \alpha(n(\lambda) - 1)\)
    • Diffraction grating: Light is reflected or transmitted in a grating with a periodic structure with a characteristic distance. Reflected/transmitted angle is driven by interferometric patterns that depend on wavelength:
      \[
      \frac{d}{\lambda} \sin \theta_m = m \in \mathbb{Z}^+
      \]
    • Dichroic filter: Mirrors with thin coatings whose n(f) and thickness are tuned to transmit/reflect specific wavelengths
