**Avalanche photodiodes (APD) vs Photomultiplier tubes (PMT)**

**Advantages of APD vs PMT**
- Better linearity of output current as a function of incident light
- Spectral response from 190 nm to 1100 nm or longer
- Higher quantum efficiency, typically 60-80%
- Low noise
- Ruggedized to mechanical stress
- No high voltage required
- Low cost
- Compact and light weight
- Long lifetime

**Disadvantages of APD vs PMT**
- Small area
- Lower internal gain
- Much lower overall sensitivity
- Photon counting only possible with specially designed, usually cooled photodiodes, with special electronic circuits
- Response time for many designs is slower
