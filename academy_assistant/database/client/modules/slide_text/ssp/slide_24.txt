Spatial Resolution: Costs

- Complexity:
  - Achieving high spatial resolution necessitates the use of highly sophisticated sensors capable of capturing detailed imagery
  - High spatial resolution images contain more pixels, resulting in a larger volume of data
- Coverage:
  - High-resolution satellite imagery covers a smaller ground area compared to lower resolution imagery. To monitor a specific region of interest, multiple high-resolution images may be required, further increasing the cost.
  - Lower resolution imagery can cover larger areas with fewer images, making it more cost-effective for broad-area monitoring
