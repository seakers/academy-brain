Slide text: 
- So far we have assumed a single scatterer (the target).
- In practice, the received signal comes from \( N_S > 1 \) scatterers, all with different phases \(\Rightarrow\) random constructive and destructive interference \(\Rightarrow\) signal fading (aka Speckle noise)
- Speckle noise appears as grainy, "salt and pepper" texture in an image
- Not due to real variations in \(\sigma\) \(\Rightarrow\) Makes image interpretation hard
