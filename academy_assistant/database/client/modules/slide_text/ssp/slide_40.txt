Optional: Avalanche photodiodes

• Strong reverse bias of photodiodes to force avalanche region

• High gain: lots of electrons per photon
    • Still less than PMTs

• They suffer from Shot noise (Poisson distribution)
    • Noise power is proportional to average signal power


The image on the right shows a graph with the following labels:

- "APDs have current gain per photon"
- "avalanche region"
- "breakdown"
