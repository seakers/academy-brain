• The group of lines with lower energy than the fundamental is called the P-branch (\(\Delta J = -1\))

• The group of lines with higher energy than the fundamental is called the R-branch (\(\Delta J = +1\))

• The line centered at the fundamental is called the Q-branch (\(\Delta J = 0\))
  • Generally (not always) forbidden
