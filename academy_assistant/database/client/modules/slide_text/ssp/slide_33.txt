Integration time - Whiskbroom

• For whiskbroom sensors, integration time is shorter because of the scanning in the cross-track direction. Assuming \(N_x\) pixels in the cross-track direction:
\[
\tau = \frac{\Delta y}{N_x V_g}
\]
    • Example: \(\Delta y = 30m, V_g = 6620m/s, N_x = 4096, \tau = 0.7\mu s\)

• The required rotation rate for the mirror is:
\[
\omega = \frac{FOR}{\Delta y / V_g}
\]

• Can improve integration time by doing along-track scanning.
