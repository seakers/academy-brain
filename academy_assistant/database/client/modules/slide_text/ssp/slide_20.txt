Imaging systems: Pushbroom vs Whiskbroom

• Pushbroom sensors utilize a stationary array of detectors to capture data across the entire swath simultaneously, offering advantages in simplicity, stability, and accuracy.

• Whiskbroom sensors require a more complex mechanical system to sweep back and forth across the swath, capturing data line by line.

• Others: multi-element whiskbroom, matrix imagers.
