Data Rate: Costs

- Data Volume:
  - Higher data rates = more data generated and transmitted from the satellite to the ground.
  - This increased volume of data requires more robust and capable ground receiving stations, data processing centers, and storage facilities.
- Onboard Processing Capabilities:
  - To efficiently manage high data rates, satellites may need advanced onboard processing capabilities.
- Communication Systems:
  - Higher data rates necessitate more sophisticated communication systems, including higher-capacity transmitters, receivers, and antennas.

Note: Increased Data Rate driven by factors in the previous slide inherently increase total mission complexity and cost
