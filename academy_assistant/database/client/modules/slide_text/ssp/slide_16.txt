Slide text:
- Spectrum of solar radiation at top of the atmosphere (TOA, yellow on figure) resembles that of a blackbody at a temperature of 5250deg C (black line)
- However, if we look at the surface, the spectrum looks quite different due to the atmosphere (red)
- We observe several absorption features of H\(_2\)O, O\(_2\), CO\(_2\), O\(_3\) and others
- Whatever features we observe in the reflected spectrum on a satellite that are not these are due to the reflectivity of the surface.
