Antenna: Costs

• Design and manufacturing:
  • Spatial resolution improvements demand larger apertures, increasing the size, weight, and cost of the antenna, necessitating more powerful launch vehicles
  • Balancing swath area with resolution impacts antenna design and cost, with wider swaths requiring advanced solutions like multi-beam antenna, phased antenna arrays, adaptive signal processing

• Technology research:
  • Developing high-sensitivity receivers for detecting weak signals and implementing noise reduction techniques increases research and manufacturing costs
  • Synthetic Aperture Radar systems involve complex algorithms and high-performance computing resources, significantly raising development and operational costs
