Radar equation – SNR

• The backscatter cross-section is related to the reflectivity from last lecture, which depends on physical properties, such as SM.
• Let’s now add the noise. Thermal noise power in the receiver is kTB. (T is the system noise temperature)
• Thus, the SNR is (for rectangular apertures):

\[
\text{SNR} = \frac{P_t \eta^2 W^2 L_c \sigma \cos^4 \theta}{8 \pi \lambda^3 B \sin \theta \ kTB}
\]

• Often, instead of by SNR, a radar is characterized by its noise-equivalent backscatter cross-section \(\sigma_n\), which is simply defined as \(\sigma\) that makes \(\text{SNR}(\sigma_n) = 1\)
  • Example: For SMAP, \(\sigma_n = -30dB\).
