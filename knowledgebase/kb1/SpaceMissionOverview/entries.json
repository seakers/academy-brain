You also need to accelerate tangentially up to \u201corbital velocity\u201d, or you would fall back down\nOrbital velocity is the velocity at which the centrifugal force pulling the satellite outwards exactly compensates for the gravitational force pulling the satellite inwards \nAbout 7.5km/s (~16,700mph) + 1-2 km/s more for losses.\nRockets are an inefficient way of getting that energy\nA lot of propellant is needed to reach that velocity\nRemember Newton\u2019s action-reaction law? the center of mass of the system (rocket + propellant) doesn\u2019t move, so if we want a heavy rocket to go up, a lot of propellant needs to go down\nRockets are about 90% of propellant in weight\nSpend most of the energy (propellant) accelerating\u2026 the propellant\n"
