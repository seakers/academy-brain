slide_text.append("""Slide 7
Why is getting to space so hard?
You need a lot of kinetic energy!
Go up at least a few hundreds of km (overcome gravity, atmospheric drag, etc.)
But that is not enough. You also need to accelerate tangentially up to ‚Äúorbital velocity‚Äù, or you would fall back down
Orbital velocity is the velocity at which the centrifugal force pulling the satellite outwards exactly compensates for the gravitational force pulling the satellite inwards 
About 7.5km/s (~16,700mph) + 1-2 km/s more for losses.
Rockets are an inefficient way of getting that energy
A lot of propellant is needed to reach that velocity
Remember Newton‚Äôs action-reaction law? the center of mass of the system (rocket + propellant) doesn‚Äôt move, so if we want a heavy rocket to go up, a lot of propellant needs to go down
Rockets are about 90% of propellant in weight
Spend most of the energy (propellant) accelerating‚Ä¶ the propellant

Why is getting into space so difficult?

The correct choice is B. Overcoming the force of Gravity is difficult as well as the need to reach the point of Orbital Velocity.

Cost of access to space
The average launch of a satellite on the order of a few hundreds to a few thousands of kg costs on the order of tens to hundreds of $M
Cost of access to space is about $5k-$20k/kg
Higher end for smaller expendable rockets
Lower end for larger reusable rockets
SpaceX in particular has disrupted this market and is bringing costs down closer to $1k/kg

Space Segment

The space segment consists of one or more spacecraft
Each spacecraft consists of
A payload: the instrument(s) that collect(s) the mission data (e.g., cameras, radars)
A spacecraft bus: the platform that provides power, communications, propulsion, attitude control, and other support to the payload. 

Each spacecraft is put into an orbit, which is the trajectory they follow around a planetary body (e.g., Earth) 

Choice of payload and orbit drive the design of the spacecraft bus and therefore drive space segment cost.

Spacecraft cost drivers

Spacecraft mass is a commonly cited driver for space mission cost
Many cost estimation relationships for space are based on mass
More sophisticated cost models are based on complexity indexes
Combine dozens of complexity factors such as payload and bus mass, power, data rate, lifetime, flight heritage, orbit‚Ä¶

Summary
The space missions and their design process can be summarized into the following topics:
Introduction to Space
 There are many motivations for space missions in the realms of exploration and science. There lies a challenge in reaching space with the large amount of kinetic energy required and in consequence the cost of launch.
 Overview of space missions
Space mission are divided into 3 segments: launch, ground, and space. Each segment consists of physical parameters or parts help the segment perform its function.
Space missions and Payloads
The type of spacecraft mission can depend on the intent/goal, customer context, or mission context. From this, an appropriate payload can be chosen. The types of satellites focused on in this module is Earth observation, space observation, communications, and navigation.
