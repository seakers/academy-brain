Space is expensive. Why?
Getting to space (without falling right back) is hard!
Rockets are inefficient
Surviving in space is also hard!
Small markets ‚Äì unique parts
Labor-intensive
Need for high reliability and ‚ÄúSpace Spiral‚Äù
Some of this is changing with the recent push for distributed space architectures but still.

Negative Feedback Cycle
    Fewer missions
    Higher reliability
    Longer schedule
    Higher cost
""")
slide_text.append("""Slide 9
Why is getting to space so hard?
You need a lot of kinetic energy!
Go up at least a few hundreds of km (overcome gravity, atmospheric drag, etc.)
But that is not enough. You also need to accelerate tangentially up to ‚Äúorbital velocity‚Äù, or you would fall back down
Orbital velocity is the velocity at which the centrifugal force pulling the satellite outwards exactly compensates for the gravitational force pulling the satellite inwards 
About 7.5km/s (~16,700mph) + 1-2 km/s more for losses.
Rockets are an inefficient way of getting that energy
A lot of propellant is needed to reach that velocity
Remember Newton‚Äôs action-reaction law? the center of mass of the system (rocket + propellant) doesn‚Äôt move, so if we want a heavy rocket to go up, a lot of propellant needs to go down
Rockets are about 90% of propellant in weight
Spend most of the energy (propellant) accelerating‚Ä¶ the propellant

slide_text.append("""Slide 10
Cost of access to space
The average launch of a satellite on the order of a few hundreds to a few thousands of kg costs on the order of tens to hundreds of $M
Cost of access to space is about $5k-$20k/kg
Higher end for smaller expendable rockets
Lower end for larger reusable rockets
SpaceX in particular has disrupted this market and is bringing costs down closer to $1k/kg

slide_text.append("""Slide 14
Space Segment

The space segment consists of one or more spacecraft
Each spacecraft consists of
A payload: the instrument(s) that collect(s) the mission data (e.g., cameras, radars)
A spacecraft bus: the platform that provides power, communications, propulsion, attitude control, and other support to the payload. 

Each spacecraft is put into an orbit, which is the trajectory they follow around a planetary body (e.g., Earth) 

Choice of payload and orbit drive the design of the spacecraft bus and therefore drive space segment cost.
""")
slide_text.append("""Slide 15
Spacecraft cost drivers

Spacecraft mass is a commonly cited driver for space mission cost
Many cost estimation relationships for space are based on mass
More sophisticated cost models are based on complexity indexes
Combine dozens of complexity factors such as payload and bus mass, power, data rate, lifetime, flight heritage, orbit‚Ä¶ 
better predictive power than mass or any other single parameter

Launch Segment

The launch segment is in charge of putting the spacecraft(s) in their desired orbit(s)
Requires a huge amount of propellant ü°∫ large rocket ü°∫ so more efficient to separate this from the spacecraft itself
The launch segment consists of one or more launches from the same or different launch vehicles.
Different launch vehicles have different sizes and can carry different amounts of weigh to various orbits

Ground Segment

The ground segment is in charge of operating the spacecraft

Track spacecraft orbital position
Serve as interface between spacecraft and data users

Mission Concept and ConOps

The mission concept is the highest level description of 
What the mission is
purpose, payload, orbit, number and type of spacecraft (more on this to come)

Often referred to as the Concept of Operations or ConOps.

Timeline of an Earth observation mission
Launch (~min to hours): Lift off, first stage separation, upper stage(s), fairing jettisoning, injection. May launch multiple satellites in different orbits.
Orbit insertion (hours to weeks): Detumbling, Deploy antennas and solar panels, perform health tests, transfer to operational orbit
Commissioning (weeks to months): Payload testing and calibration
Nominal operations (~3-10 years): Acquire images, send down to Earth, perform station-keeping maneuvers, software updates. May include nominal orbital changes.
Extended operations (0-10 years): If there is extra funding for ops, extend operations for current or new goals, in same or different orbit.
End of life (deorbiting, hours to weeks): Reentry and burn through Earth‚Äôs atmosphere or move intro ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù orbit

Data Delivery

Space vs ground processing
    Instrument raw data is usually in electrical units mV
    Expensive data processing algorithms are done to filter, calibrate, convert to physical units, and bin the data into images.
    Which of those do we do on-board?
Centralized vs distributed processing: All done on one computer or multiple dedicated computers? Decoupling is nice for performance, risk, testing, etc. but may increase cost.
Level of autonomy: from 100% manual to 100% automatic.
All these are inter-related.
