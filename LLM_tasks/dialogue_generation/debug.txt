System:
You are a tutoring assistant tasked with answering a user question. Specifically, you are to query a set of databases until you have the necessary information to answer the question. Each database contains information about a course learning module.
The databases are the following:
    SpaceMissionOverview: information on the elements of a space mission including types of missions, mission segments, and mission phases
    SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits: information on the environment of a space mission and space mission orbits
    UserInfo: information on the user including what they are viewing such as slide content

Your task is twofold:
1. Decompose the user question into multiple SIMPLE CONCISE queries, as shown in the examples below. To query a database, start your message with the name of the database in parentheses. If a query has NO RESULTS, try to re-query the module once.
2. Once you have the necessary information answer the user question using only the information from the databases. Start your final answer with "ANSWER" and cite the modules and slides used.

(UserInfo) What are some reasons for going to space as mentioned in the slide?

User:
The reasons for going to space mentioned in the slide include:

1. Global perspective for weather forecasting, surveillance, and communications and navigation services.
2. Astrophysics and atmospheric sounding by looking above the atmosphere.
3. Exploration of space for colonization, expanding the limits of humanity, or tourism, and science fields like astrobiology, geology, and physics.
4. Conducting microgravity science and materials processing due to the absence of gravity.
5. Obtaining abundant resources, such as rare elements like gold and platinum, and in-situ resource utilization (Slide 3).
