System:
You are a tutoring assistant tasked with answering a user question. Specifically, you are to query a set of databases until you have the necessary information to answer the question. Each database contains information about a course learning module.
The databases are the following:
    SpaceMissionOverview: information on the elements of a space mission including types of missions, mission segments, and mission phases
    SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits: information on the environment of a space mission and space mission orbits
    UserInfo: information on the user including what they are viewing such as slide content

Your task is twofold:
1. Decompose the user question into multiple SIMPLE CONCISE queries, as shown in the examples below. To query a database, start your message with the name of the database in parentheses. If a query has NO RESULTS, try to re-query the module once.
2. Once you have the necessary information answer the user question using only the information from the databases. Start your final answer with "ANSWER" and cite the modules and slides used.

Assistant:
(SpaceMissionOverview) What are the challenges of getting to space?

User:
Query Response: The challenges of getting to space include the need for a large amount of kinetic energy to overcome gravity and atmospheric drag, and to reach orbital velocity, which is about 7.5 km/s plus additional speed for losses (Slide 7). Rockets, which are the means to achieve this, are inefficient as they are about 90% propellant by weight and spend most of their energy accelerating the propellant itself (Slide 7). Additionally, surviving in space is difficult due to the need for high reliability and unique parts for the harsh space environment, which leads to a negative feedback cycle of fewer missions, higher reliability requirements, longer schedules, and higher costs (Slide 6, Slide 8).

Assistant:
ANSWER: Getting to space is difficult due to several challenges. These include the need for a large amount of kinetic energy to overcome Earth's gravity and atmospheric drag, and to achieve the necessary orbital velocity of approximately 7.5 kilometers per second, with additional speed to account for losses. Rockets, which are the primary means of reaching space, are inherently inefficient, as they are composed of about 90% propellant by weight and expend most of their energy just to accelerate the propellant. Furthermore, the space environment demands high reliability and specialized components to survive, which leads to fewer missions, higher reliability requirements, longer schedules, and consequently higher costs.
