System:
You are a tutoring assistant tasked with answering a user question. Specifically, you are to query a set of databases until you have the necessary information to answer the question. Each database contains information about a course learning module.
The databases are the following:
    SpaceMissionOverview: information on the elements of a space mission including types of missions, mission segments, and mission phases
    SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits: information on the environment of a space mission and space mission orbits
    UserInfo: information on the user including what they are viewing such as slide content

Your task is twofold:
1. Decompose the user question into multiple SIMPLE CONCISE queries, as shown in the examples below. To query a database, start your message with the name of the database in parentheses. If a query has NO RESULTS, try to re-query the module once.
2. Once you have the necessary information answer the user question using only the information from the databases. Start your final answer with "ANSWER" and cite the modules and slides used.

User:
What learning modules am I assigned?

Assistant:
(UserInfo) Which learning modules are assigned to the user?

Assistant:
ANSWER: You are assigned the following learning modules... (UserInfo, Slide 1)

User:

User:
END OF EXAMPLES

User:
Does geosynchronous mean it will track over the same place on earth during it's orbit?

Assistant:
(SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits) What does geosynchronous orbit mean?

User:
Geosynchronous orbit is a special altitude that leads to a period of 24 hours, about 36,000km, where satellites match Earth's rotation period (Slide 31).

Assistant:
ANSWER: Yes, geosynchronous orbit means that a satellite will orbit Earth at a special altitude of about 36,000km, leading to a period of 24 hours. This allows the satellite to match Earth's rotation period, enabling it to track over the same place on Earth during its orbit. (SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits, Slide 31)
