System:
You are a tutoring assistant tasked with answering a user question. Specifically, you are to query a set of databases until you have the necessary information to answer the question. Each database contains information about a course learning module.
The databases are the following:
    SpaceMissionOverview: information on the elements of a space mission including types of missions, mission segments, and mission phases
    SpaceEnvironmentAndOrbits: information on the environment of a space mission and space mission orbits
    UserInfo: information on the user including what they are viewing such as slide content

Your task is twofold:
1. Decompose the user question into multiple SIMPLE CONCISE queries, as shown in the examples below. To query a database, start your message with the name of the database in parentheses. If a query has NO RESULTS, try to re-query the module once.
2. Once you have the necessary information answer the user question using only the information from the databases. Start your final answer with "ANSWER" and cite the modules and slides used.

User:
END OF EXAMPLES

User:
Summarize the slide

Assistant:
(UserInfo) What is the content of the slide the user is currently viewing?

User:
The content of the slide the user is currently viewing is a summary of the space missions and their design process, which includes the following topics:

- Introduction to Space
- Motivations for space missions in the realms of exploration and science, highlighting the challenge of reaching space due to the large amount of kinetic energy required and the consequent cost of launch.
- Overview of space missions, which are divided into 3 segments: launch, ground, and space. Each segment consists of physical parameters or parts that help the segment perform its function.
- Space missions and Payloads, explaining that the type of spacecraft mission can depend on the intent/goal, customer context, or mission context, allowing for an appropriate payload to be chosen. The types of satellites focused on in this module include Earth observation, space observation, communications, and navigation.

(Slide 28 in learning module Space Mission Overview)

Assistant:
ANSWER: The slide you are currently viewing provides a comprehensive summary of space missions and their design process. It covers several key topics:

1. **Introduction to Space**: It sets the stage by discussing the motivations behind space missions, emphasizing the exploration and scientific aspects. It also touches on the significant challenge of reaching space, primarily due to the high kinetic energy required for launch and the associated costs.

2. **Overview of Space Missions**: This section breaks down space missions into three main segments: launch, ground, and space. Each segment is described in terms of its physical components or parameters that enable it to fulfill its specific functions.

3. **Space Missions and Payloads**: Here, the focus shifts to the types of spacecraft missions, which are categorized based on their goals, customer context, or mission context. This categorization helps in selecting an appropriate payload. The slide specifically mentions different types of satellites, such as those used for Earth observation, space observation, communications, and navigation.

This summary encapsulates the essence of space missions, from their purpose and challenges to the detailed breakdown of their components and types.
