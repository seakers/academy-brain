Foreword 
This second edition of Space Vehicle Design by Michael D. Grifh and James . 
R. French is an updated, thorough treatment of an important and rapidly evolving 
subject in the aerospace field. The first edition has been a valuable part of the 
AIAA Education Book Series, and we are very pleased to welcome this new 
edition to the series. The second edition features the addition of a new chapter on 
reliability analysis, as well as more and updated technical material and many 
excercises. 
This design textbook is arranged in a logical fashion starting with mission 
considerations then spacecraft environment, astrodynamics, propulsion, atmos- 
pheric entry, attitude control, configuration and structures, subsystems, and 
finally reliability, so that university courses at different academic levels can be 
based upon it. In addition, this text can be used as a basis for continuing education 
short courses or independent self study. The book is divided into 12 chapters and 
2 appendices covering more than 600 pages. 
The AIAA Education Series aims to cover a broad range of topics in the 
general aerospace field, including basic theory, applications, and design. A 
complete list of titles published in the series can be found on the last pages in this 
volume. The philosophy of the series is to develop textbooks that can be used in a 
college or university setting, instructional materials for intensive continuing 
education and professional development courses, and also books that can serve as 
the basis for independent self study for working professionals in the aerospace 
field. Suggestions for new topics and authors for the series are always welcome.

Foreword to the Previous Edition 
The publication of Space Vehicle Design by Michael D. Griffin and James 
R. French satisfies an urgent need for a comprehensive text on space systems 
engineering. This new text provides both suitable material for senior-level 
courses in aerospace engineering and a useful reference for the practicing 
aerospace engineer. The text incorporates several different engineering 
disciplines that must be considered concurrently as a part of the integrated 
design process and optimization. It also gives an excellent description of the 
design process and its accompanying tradeoffs for subsystems such as propulsion, 
power sources, guidance and control, and communications. 
The text starts with an overall description of the basic mission considerations 
for spacecraft design, including space environment, astrodynamics, and 
atmospheric reentry. Then the various subsystems are discussed, and in each 
case both the theoretical background and the current engineering practice are 
fully explained. Thus the reader is exposed to the overall systems-engineering 
process, with its attendant conflicting requirements of individual subsystems. 
Space Vehicle Design reflects the authors' long experience with the spacecraft 
design process. It embodies a wealth of information for designers and research 
engineers alike. But most importantly, it provides the fundamental knowledge for 
the space systems engineer to evaluate the overall impact of candidate design 
concepts on the various component subsystems and the integrated system leading 
to the final design selection. 
With the national commitment to space exploration, as evidenced by the 
continuing support of the Space Station and the National Aero-Space Plane 
programs, this new text on space system engineering will prove a timely service 
in support of future space activities.

Preface 
We can only smile, more than a bit ironically, when we read the preface to the 
first edition of this text, which follows. Much has changed, both in the space 
community and in the larger world, in the 13 years since that edition appeared. 
Even more has changed in the two decades since the project was originally begun. 
One thing that has not is the difficulty of shoehorning a book project, even a 
"mere" revision, into lives dominated by professional careers. We are not unique

We can only smile, more than a bit ironically, when we read the preface to the
first edition of this text, which follows. Much has changed, both in the space
community and in the larger world, in the 13 years since that edition appeared.
Even more has changed in the two decades since the project was originally begun.
One thing that has not is the difficulty of shoehorning a book project, even a
“mere” revision, into lives dominated by professional careers. We are not unique
in that regard; still, we would not have guessed that the production of this second
edition would have required twice the time of the first.

Our earlier comments concerning the dearth of texts in the general field of

Preface to the Previous Edition 
The idea for this text originated in the early 1980s with a senior-level aerospace 
engineering course in Spacecraft Design, taught by one of us at the University of 
Maryland. It was then a very frustrating exercise to provide appropriate reference 
materials for the students. Space vehicle design being an extraordinarily diverse 
field, no one text-in fact, no small group of texts-was available to unify the 
many disciplines of spacecraft systems engineering. As a consequence, in 1983 
we decided to collaborate on a unifying text. The structure and academic level of 
the book followed from our development of a professional seminar series in 
spacecraft design. To meet the needs of engineers and others attending the 
seminars, the original academic course notes were radically revised and greatly 
expanded; when complete, the notes formed the outline for the present textbook. 
The book meets, we believe, the needs of an upper-level undergraduate or 
Master's-level graduate course in aerospace vehicle design, and should likewise 
prove useful at the professional level. In this regard, our text represents somewhat 
of a departure from the more conventional academic style; it generally omits first- 
principle derivations in favor of integrating results from many specialized 
technical fields as they pertain to vehicle design and engineering tradeoffs at the 
system level. 
It has been a long and torturous path to publication. Writing the manuscript 
was the easy part; publication was much more difficult. In the mid-1980s various 
publishers (not AM) showed discomfort with a perceived low-volume, "niche" 
product and backed away from the commitment we wanted. Job changes and the 
authors' busy schedules forced additional delays. And despite all the time it has 
taken to obtain the finished product, we both see many changes and 
improvements we would have liked to have made-but that would doubtless 
be true no matter how long we had worked. 
In any event, the job is done for now. To all who have begun conversations 
with us in the last several years with, "When is the book coming out?," here it is. 
We hope you find it worth the wait.

In this book we attempt to treat the major engineering specialty areas involved

To attain this breadth, the depth of coverage in each area is necessarily limited. 
This is not a book for the specialist in attitude control, propulsion, astrodynamics,

incorporated into a-final spacecraft design and for those who wish to add to their 
knowledge of other disciplines. 
To this end we have subordinated our desires to include involved analyses, 
detailed discussions of design and fabrication methods, etc. Equations are rarely 
derived, and never when they would interfere with the flow of the text; however, 
we take pains to state the assumptions behind any equations used. We believe that 
the detailed developments appropriate to each specialty area are well covered in 
other texts or in the archive journals. We refer the reader to these works where 
appropriate. Our goal in this work is to show how the knowledge aild constraints 
from various fields are synthesized at the overall system level to obtain a 
completed design. 
We intend this book to be suitable as a text for use in a senior- or graduate- 
level design course in a typical aerospace engineering cumculum. Very few 
students emerge from four years of schooling in engineering or physical science 
feeling comfortable with the larger arena in which they will practice their 
specialty. This is rarely their fault; academic work by its nature tends to 
concentrate on that which is known and done, and to educate the student in such 
techniques. This it does very well, subject of course to the cooperation of the 
student. What is not taught is how to function in the fact of the unknown, the 
uncertain, and the not-yet-done. This is where the practicing engineer or scientist 
must learn to synthesize his knowledge, to combine the specialized concepts he 
has learned in order to obtain a new and useful result. This does not seem to be a 
quality that is taught in school.

1.1. Introduction

In this book we attempt to treat the major engineering specialty areas involved
in space vehicle and mission design from the viewpoint of the systems engineer.
To attain this breadth, the depth of coverage in each area is necessarily limited.
This is not a book for the specialist in attitude control, propulsion, astrodynamics,
heat transfer, structures, etc., who seeks to enhance his knowledge of his own
area. It is a book for those who wish to see how their own specialty is
incorporated into a final spacecraft design and for those who wish to add to their
knowledge of other disciplines.

To this end we have subordinated our desires to include involved analyses,
detailed discussions of design and fabrication methods, etc. Equations are rarely
derived, and never when they would interfere with the flow of the text; however,
we take pains to state the assumptions behind any equations used. We believe that
the detailed developments appropriate to each specialty area are well covered in
other texts or in the archive journals. We refer the reader to these works where
appropriate. Our goal in this work is to show how the knowledge and constraints
from various fields are synthesized at the overall system level to obtain a
completed design.

We intend this book to be suitable as a text for use in a senior- or graduate-
level design course in a typical aerospace engineering curriculum. Very few
students emerge from four years of schooling in engineering or physical science
feeling comfortable with the larger arena in which they will practice their
specialty. This is rarely their fault, academic work by its nature tends to

cases of interest. We therefore include much more data in tabular and graphic 
form on the actual performance and construction of various rocket vehicles. We 
follow the same philosophy for attitude control, guidance, power, telecommu- 
nications, and for the other specialty areas and systems discussed here. However, 
this is not a "cookbook" or a compendium of standard results that can be applied 
to every problem. No book or course of instruction can serve as a solution manual 
to all engineering problems. In fact, we take as an article of faith that, in any 
interesting engineering work, one is paid to solve previously unsolved problems. 
The most that any text can do is to provide a guide to the fundamentals. This we 
have tried to do by providing both data and analytical results, with a chain of 
references leading to appropriate sources. 
1.2 Systems Engineering Process 
1.2.1 What Is Systems Engineering? 
The responses to this question are many and varied. To some who claim to 
practice systems engineering, the activity seems to mean maintaining detailed 
lists of vehicle components, mass properties, and the name, number, and pedigree 
of each conductor that crosses the boundary between any two subsystems. To 
others it means computer architecture and software with little or no attention 
to hardware. To still others it means sophisticated computer programs for 
management and decision making, and so on. 
In the opinion of the authors, definitions such as these are too restricted. As 
with the fabled blind men describing the elephant, each perceives some element 
of fact, but none fully describes the beast. As an aid to understanding the purpose 
of this book, we offer the following definition: 
Space systems engineering is the art and science of developing an operable 
system capable of meeting mission requirements within imposed constraints 
including (but not restricted to) mass, cost, and schedule. 
Clearly, all of the concepts mentioned earlier, plus many more, play a part in 
such an activity. Some may feel that the definition is too broad. That, however, is 
precisely the point. Systems engineering, properly done, is perhaps the broadest 
of engineering disciplines. The space systems engineer has the responsibility of 
defining a system based on requirements and constraints and overseeing its 
creation from a variety of technologies and subsystems. 
In such a complex environment, conflict is the order of the day. The resolution 
of such conflict in an effective and productive manner is the goal of systems 
engineering. For all of today's high technology and sophisticated analytical 
capability, the solution is not always clear. This, plus the fact that one is dealing 
with people as nwch as with hardware or software, accounts for the inclusion of 
the word "art" in our definition. There will come a time in any system

with people as much as with hardware or software, accounts for the inclusion of
the word “art” in our definition. There will come a time in any system

development when educated human judgment and understanding will be worth 
more than any amount of computer analysis. This in no way demeans the 
importance of detailed analysis and the specialists who perform it, but, applied 
without judgment or conducted in an atmosphere of preconception and prejudice, 
such analysis can be a road to failure. This truth has been demonstrated more than 
once, unfortunately, in the history of both military and civilian technical 
developments. It is the task of the systems engineer to avoid these pitfalls and to 
make the technical decisions that best serve the achievement of the goal outlined 
in our definition. 
1.2.2 Systems Engineering Requirements 
To perform the task, there are certain characteristics that, if not mandatory, are 
at least desirable in the systems engineer. These are presented and amplified in 
this section. 
The systems engineer must have an understanding of the goals of the project. 
These may be scientific, military, or commercial. Whatever the case, it is not 
possible to meet these goals without a full understanding of them. Decisions 
made without full knowledge of their context are subject to errors that would 
otherwise be avoided. Not only must the systems engineer understand the goals, 
but it is incumbent upon him to share this knowledge with his team, so that they 
too understand the purpose of the effort. 
A broad comprehension of the relevant technical issues is mandatory. It is 
beyond reasonable expectation that the systems engineer be an expert in all 
disciplines. No single human can aspire to the full breadth and depth of 
knowledge required in all of the technical specialties relevant to space vehicle 
design. That is why a broadly capable design team is required for any significant 
engineering project. However, to make proper use of the resources afforded by 
such a team, the systems engineer must be sufficiently conversant with each of the 
relevant technical areas to comprehend the issues and to make appropriate 
decisions. It is imperative that any technical decision must be evaluated in terms 
of its effects on the entire system, not just those subsystems most obviously 
involved. This can be done only if there is a broad understanding of all space 
vehicle technologies, leading to an appreciation for the unintended, as well as 
intentional, consequences of a design decision. Ideally the systems engineer 
should be able to carry out a preliminary analysis in most aerospace disciplines. 
This, as much as any other single factor, is the primary motivation for this text. 
There are individual traits and organizational practices that commend 
themselves to systems engineering, and others that do not. The university system 
has a natural tendency to create specialists rather than generalists, especially in 
advanced degree programs. Initial advancement within any organization is 
generally accorded to those who make clearly outstanding contributions within 
their area of responsibility, often rather narrowly defined. It is therefore quite

1.2.2 Systems Engineering Requirements

To perform the task, there are certain characteristics that, if not mandatory, are
at least desirable in the systems engineer. These are presented and amplified in
this section.

The systems engineer must have an understanding of the goals of the project.
These may be scientific, military, or commercial. Whatever the case, it is not
possible to meet these goals without a full understanding of them. Decisions
made without full knowledge of their context are subject to errors that would
otherwise be avoided. Not only must the systems engineer understand the goals,
but it is incumbent upon him to share this knowledge with his team, so that they
too understand the purpose of the effort.

A broad comprehension of the relevant technical issues is mandatory. It is
beyond reasonable expectation that the systems engineer be an expert in all
disciplines. No single human can aspire to the full breadth and depth of
knowledge required in all of the technical specialties relevant to space vehicle
design. That is why a broadly capable design team is required for any significant
engineering project. However, to make proper use of the resources afforded by
such a team, the systems engineer must be sufficiently conversant with each of the
relevant technical areas to comprehend the issues and to make appropriate

of its effects on the entire system, not just those subsystems most obviously
involved. This can be done only if there is a broad understanding of all space
vehicle technologies, leading to an appreciation for the unintended, as well as
intentional, consequences of a design decision. Ideally the systems engineer
should be able to carry out a preliminary analysis in most aerospace disciplines.
This, as much as any other single factor, is the primary motivation for this text.

There are individual traits and organizational practices that commend
themselves to systems engineering, and others that do not. The university system
has a natural tendency to create specialists rather than generalists, especially in
advanced degree programs. Initial advancement within any organization is
generally accorded to those who make clearly outstanding contributions within
their area of responsibility, often rather narrowly defined. It is therefore quite
common to find engineers having substantial credentials of education and

experience, who exhibit great depth of knowledge in a given discipline, but who 
lack the breadth of knowledge required for effective systems engineering. 
This combination of successful performance in a specialized area and 
excellent academic credentials often results in promotion to a position requiring 
a systems-oriented viewpoint. If this requirement is recognized, and if the 
selected individual has the ability and natural inclination to pursue a necessarily 
broader perspective, this can work very well. If, however, the individual 
inherently prefers to maintain a narrower view, becoming a "specialist in 
systems engineering clothing," problems will arise from excessive concen- 
tration in some areas and neglect of others. This is not to say that the job cannot 
be done, but it will probably not be done as well or proceed as smoothly as it 
would otherwise. Effective systems engineering truly requires a different 
rnindset than that appropriate to more specialized disciplines, and there is little 
available in the way of formal training and practical experience to allow one to 
prepare for it. 
Given that the systems engineer cannot do everything, and requires the assistance 
of a design team, it follows that an important characteristic of the systems engineer 
is the ability to make maximum use of the capabilities of others. Part of this 
involves the difficult-to-define characteristic of "leadership." However one might 
define it, the manifestation of leadership of interest here involves obtaining 
maximum productivity from the team. Again, this is a matter of degree. A team 
of capable people will usually produce an acceptable product even with poor 
leadership. However, the same team, properly led, is vastly more effective. 
Participating in such an effort is generally an enjoyable experience for all who are 
involved. This aspect of the systems engineering task is discussed in more detail later 
in this chapter. 
The essence of the previous paragraph is that the systems engineer must 
advocate and embrace, to the maximum extent possible, the hackneyed word 
"teamwork." It is truly appropriate in this instance in that, if the design team does 
not function as a fully integrated team rather than as a group of individuals, 
- effectiveness will be diminished. The systems engineer has as one of his 
duties that of fostering the team spirit. 
In any complex system, there is normally more than one solution to a problem. 
Various requirements will often conflict, and requirements and capabilities will 
not match perfectly. Success requires compromise. Indeed, it often seems that the 
essence of the task of systems engineering is to effect a series of compromises 
along the path to project completion. To those who feel that technical decisions 
should be pure, free of compromise, and always have a clear answer, the real 
world of engineering, and especially systems engineering, will bring considerable 
disappointment. Willingness to compromise within reasonable limits is a vital 
characteristic of the systems engineer. 
The key ingredient in successful systems engineering and design, and in 
effecting the compromises discussed here, is sound engineering judgment.

experience, who exhibit great depth of knowledge in a given discipline, but who
lack the breadth of knowledge required for effective systems engineering.

This combination of successful performance in a specialized area and

excellent academic credentials often results in promotion to a position requiring
a systems-oriented viewpoint. If this requirement is recognized, and if the
selected individual has the ability and natural inclination to pursue a necessarily
broader perspective, this can work very well. If, however, the individual
inherently prefers to maintain a narrower view, becoming a “specialist in

important to the success of a project can be analyzed, sometimes because the data 
or tools are not available, and sometimes because of resource limitations. 
Moreover, even when analysis is possible, it must be constantly realized that 
analytical models used in the practice of engineering are just that-models. 
Engineering models approximate the real world, some more accurately than 
others, but no model can do so perfectly. Very often the results derived from such 
models are ambiguous, or can be understood only in a particular context. Also, 
such results will always be silent with respect to the importance of physical effects 
not included in the underlying model. The judgment of the team, and ultimately of 
the systems engineer, must be the final decision mechanism in such cases. 
To some degree, judgment is a characteristic with which one is born. However, 
to be meaningful its use must be grounded in both education and experience. 
1.2.3 Managing the Design Team 
We have referred repeatedly to the design team and its importance, which we 
feel can hardly be overemphasized. A competent multidiscipline team is the most 
powerful tool at the disposal of the systems engineer. The quality of the product is 
a direct reflection of the capability of the team and the quality of its leadership. 
Computer-aided design packages and other analytical tools can enhance the 
productivity of the team and make the task easier, but cannot substitute for human 
judgment and knowledge, a point that we have made previously and will continue 
to emphasize throughout this text. 
As mentioned, the reason for using a design team is simply that no single 
person can have sufficient knowledge in all of the technical discipline areas 
required to carry out a complex engineering task. The protean "mad scientist" of

INTRODUCTION 5

important to the success of a project can be analyzed, sometimes because the data
or tools are not available, and sometimes because of resource limitations.

Moreover, even when analysis is possible, it must be constantly realized that
analytical models used in the practice of engineering are just that—models.
Engineering models approximate the real world, some more accurately than
others, but no model can do so perfectly. Very often the results derived from such
models are ambiguous, or can be understood only in a particular context. Also,
such results will always be silent with respect to the importance of physical effects
not included in the underlying model. The judgment of the team, and ultimately of
the systems engineer, must be the final decision mechanism in such cases.

To some degree, judgment is a characteristic with which one is born. However,
to be meaningful its use must be grounded in both education and experience.

1.2.3. Managing the Design Team

We have referred repeatedly to the design team and its importance, which we
fee] can hardly be overemphasized. A competent multidiscipline team is the most
powerful too] at the disposal of the systems engineer. The quality of the product is
a direct reflection of the capability of the team and the quality of its leadership.
Computer-aided design packages and other analytical tools can enhance the
productivity of the team and make the task easier, but cannot substitute for human
judgment and knowledge, a point that we have made previously and will continue
to emphasize throughout this text.

As mentioned, the reason for using a design team is simply that no single
person can have sufficient knowledge in all of the technical discipline areas
required to carry out a complex engineering task. The protean “mad scientist” of
popular fiction who can carry out a complex project (e.g., a rocket to the moon)
unaided is indeed purely fictional. This does not seem to preclude people from
trying, however. The authors can point to a number of projects, nameless in this
volume to protect us from the wrath of the guilty, that were in fact done as a “one-
man show” to the extent that a single individual tried, single-handedly, to
integrate the inputs of the specialists rather than to lead the team in a coordinated
effort. Uniformly, the output is a system of greater complexity and cost, and
lesser capability, than it might have been.

A properly run design team is synergistic in that it is greater than the sum of its
parts. If all of the same people were used but kept apart, interacting only with the
systems engineer, each would obviously be no less intelligent than when part of a
team. Yet experience shows that the well-run team outperforms a diverse array of
specialists. The authors attribute this to the vigorous interaction. between team
members, and to the sharing of knowledge, viewpoints, and concerns that often
cause a solution to surface that no individual would have conceived when
working alone. Often this is serendipitous; the discussion of one problem may
suggest a solution for some other apparently unrelated concern. This can only
happen in a closely knit team experiencing frequent interaction.

6 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Although there is no cut-and-dried rule, reasonably frequent design meetings 
are necessary to promote the concept and sense of a team. Meetings should be 
held sufficiently often to maintain momentum and to reinforce a habit of 
attendance. They should not be so frequent as to become boring or to waste time. 
Except in rare instances, formal, full-team meetings should not be held more 
frequently than once per week. Intervals greater than two weeks are generally 
undesirable because of the loss of momentum that ensues. Of course, there will be 
many individual and subgroup interactions on specific topics once the team is 
accustomed to working together. 
As the leader of the team, there are certain responsibilities borne by the 
systems engineer. He must ensure that all members contribute. Personality 
differences among design team members often result in meetings' being 
dominated by a few extroverts, to the exclusion of other introverts who have as 
much to say, but lack the aggressiveness to assert themselves. The systems 
engineer must ensure that each individual contributes, both because of his 
responsibility to foster true teamwork, and because it is important to have all 
ideas available for consideration, not just those belonging to the extroverts. This 
may require the systems engineer to ask a few leading questions, or to press for an 
expanded answer, but this is fully a part of the task of leading the team. So, 
unfortunately, is that of suppressing the excess verbosity of other individuals! 
A phenomenon that plagues many meetings is that of digression from the 
relevant topic prior to its orderly resolution. In any reasonably large group of 
people, many spurious thoughts will arise that are not germane to the topic at hand. 
The group can easily be seduced into following the new line of thought, and 
ignoring the prior topic. It is the duty of the team leader to prevent excessive 
deviation from the intended subject, and thus to maintain appropriate focus. Of 
course, in a long, intense meeting, an occasional digression can be refreshing and 
can ease the tension. This must be allowed, but with-again-judgment, to prevent 
the waste of time and, importantly, the failure to address all of the relevant matters. 
Equally distressing is the tendency of some to ramble at great length, repeating 
themselves and offering unnecessary detail. The team leader must intervene, with 
due sensitivity and concern for the feelings of others, when in his judgment the 
point of useful return is passed. In a similar vein, a few individuals involved in a 
discussion concerning the fine details of a problem that appears to be below the 
reasonable level of interest to the team should be directed to arrange a separate 
meeting. Again, judgment is required as to when the point of productivity for 
the team has been reached and passed.

1.3 Requirements and Tradeoffs

As noted earlier, the goal of the process led by the systems engineer is to
develop a system to meet the requirements of the project. However, it is rarely if
ever true that even the highest-level requirements are edicted in complete,

INTRODUCTION 7 
detailed, and unequi'vocal form. President John F. Kennedy's famously audacious 
goal, ". . .before this decade is out, to land a man upon the moon and return him 
safely to the Earth" stands in its stark simplicity as one of the few so expressed. 
Indeed, the pithy enunciation of this top-level requirement has been credited by 
many as being an important factor behind the ultimate success of Project Apollo. 
However, most engineers, and most engineering projects, do not benefit from 
goals so succinctly expressed and so clearly motivated. They instead are usually 
the result of a complex, interactive process involving a variety of factors that may 
not be obvious. The following sections will discuss requirements derivation in 
general terms. 
1.3.1 Top-Level Requirements 
The basic goals and constraints of a given space mission will generally be 
defined by the user or customer for the resulting system. Such goals will usually 
be expressed in terms of the target and activity, e.g., "Orbit Mars and observe 
atmospheric phenomena with particular emphasis on.. ." or "Develop a 
geosynchronous communications satellite capable of carrying 24 transponders 
operating in.. . ." At the same time, various constraints may be levied such as 
project start date, launch date, total cost, first year cost, etc. The top-level system 
requirements will then be derived from these goals and constraints. 
Inputs for development of top-level requirements may come from a variety of 
sources. For example, scientific missions will typically have associated a science 
working group (SWG) composed of specialists in the field. (Usually these 
individuals will not be potential investigators on the actual mission to prevent any 
possible conflict of interest.) This group will provide detailed definition of the 
science goals of the mission in terms of specific observations to be made, types of 
instruments, sensors that might be used, etc. 
The SWG requirements and desires must be evaluated against the constraints 
and capabilities that otherwise define the mission. This will often be the systems 
engineer's most difficult task. The various scientific goals are often in conflict 
with one another, or with the reality of practical engineering. Scientific 
investigators in single-minded pursuit of a goal often tolerate compromise 
poorly. Development of an innovative mission and system design to satisfy as 
many requirements and desires as possible, while simultaneously achieving a 
suitable compromise among those which conflict, is a major test of both 
engineering and diplomatic skill. Furthermore, once slain, the dragon will not 
remain dead, but continues to revive as the mission and system design and the 
science payload become better defined. 
Nonscientific missions usually have a similar source of inputs. This group may 
go by various names, but can generically be referred to as a user working group, 
and represents the needs and desires of the user community. As with science 
requirements, some of these may be in conflict, and resolution and compromise 
will be required. In many cases, spacecraft may be single-purpose devices, e.g., a

goal, “.. .before this decade is out, to land a man upon the moon and return him

1.3.1 Top-Level Requirements

The basic goals and constraints of a given space mission will generally be
defined by the user or customer for the resulting system. Such goals will usually
be expressed in terms of the target and activity, e.g., “Orbit Mars and observe
atmospheric phenomena with particular emphasis on...” or “Develop a
geosynchronous communications satellite capable of carrying 24 transponders
operating in....” At the same time, various constraints may be levied such as
project start date, Jaunch date, total cost, first year cost, etc. The top-level system
requirements will then be derived from these goals and constraints.

Inputs for development of top-level requirements may come from a variety of
sources. For example, scientific missions will typically have associated a science
working group (SWG) composed of specialists in the field. (Usually these
individuals will not be potential investigators on the actual mission to prevent any
possible conflict of interest.) This group will provide detailed definition of the
science goals of the mission in terms of specific observations to be made, types of
instruments, sensors that might be used, etc.

The SWG requirements and desires must be evaluated against the constraints
and capabilities that otherwise define the mission. This will often be the systems

and represents the needs and desires of the user community. As with science
requirements, some of these may be in conflict, and resolution and compromise
will be required. In many cases, spacecraft may be single-purpose devices, e.g., a

8 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
communications relay satellite. In such a case, the problems with resolution of 
con3icting requirements are greatly reduced. 
The study team itself has the primary responsibility for the development of 
top-level requirements for the system by turning the mission goals and desires 
into engineering requirements for the spacecraft, to be later converted into 
specific numerical requirements. As always, this is a process involving design 
iteration and compromise in order to establish a realistic set of requirements. 
Interaction between various subsystem and technology areas is essential to 
understand the impact of requirements on the complete system, and to minimize 
the likelihood of expensive surprises. 
In some cases, particularly when the mission requires operation at the limits of 
available technology, various expert advisory groups may contribute to the 
process. Such groups may provide current data or projections of probable 
direction and degree of development during the course of the project. 
1.3.2 Functfonaf Requirements 
Once the toplevel requirements are defined, the next step is to derive from 
them the functional requirements defining what the system and the subsystems of 
which it is composed must accomplish in order to carry out the mission. 
Functional requirements are derived by converting the top-level requirements 
into engineering specifications such as velocity change, orbital elements, 
instrument fields of view, pointing direction, pointing accuracy, available power, 
operational duty cycle, and a variety of other parameters. 
The derivation of the functional requirements must be done within the context 
of technical capability and constraints on cost and schedule. This is a critical 
juncture in the project. Unthinking acceptance of unrealistic requirements on a 
subsystem, or arbitrary assumptions as to the availability of necessary 
technology, can lead to major problems with schedule and/or cost. As an 
example, it is very easy to accept a requirement for a given level of pointing 
accuracy without critically assessing what the requirement may imply in terms of 
demands on attitude control sensors and effectors, structural fabrication accuracy 
and rigidity, etc. 
Excessively demanding requirements can increase costs, delay schedule, or 
both. To avoid this, the proposed requirement should first be evaluated as to its 
necessity. Is the desired accuracy essential to the mission, or was it selected 
because of prior experience or heritage that might or might not be relevant? 
Sometimes a demanding requirement will be levied in a deliberate effort to justify 
use of an exciting new technology. If one of the mission goals is to advance 
technology, this may be appropriate; if the goal is to obtain observational data at 
the lowest cost in the least possible time, it may be essential to avoid performance 
requirements at or close to state-of-the-art limits. 
The preliminary version of the functional requirements document is based on 
the top-level requirements and a preliminary assessment of the intended 
8 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

communications relay satellite. In such a case, the problems with resolution of
conflicting requirements are greatly reduced.

The study team itself has the primary responsibility for the development of
top-level requirements for the system by turning the mission goals and desires

Once the top-level requirements are defined, the next step is to derive from
them the functional requirements defining what the system and the subsystems of
which it is composed must accomplish in order to carry out the mission.
Functional requirements are derived by converting the top-level requirements
into engineering specifications such as velocity change, orbital elements,

The derivation of the functional requirements must be done within the context

spacecraft capability. At this stage, design details will be limited'in mod areas, 
and a great many specific requirements will remain "to be determined" (TBD). 
The TBDs will be replaced by quantitative values early in the design phase. It 
is important for the design team to work toward early completion of the 
functional requirement, and to establish.values for the TBD items. Of course, as 
the design progresses, the functional requirements will evolve and mature. Some 
requirements will inevitably change; however, striving for early definition helps 
to accelerate the achievement of requirements stability. 
Early definition of functional requirements is desirable, some would even say 
vital, to program stability and cost control. Probably no single factor has been 
more to blame for cost and schedule overruns than changing requirements in 
midprogram. This may happen at the top level or at the functional level. In the 
former case, the systems engineer has little control, although it is his duty to point 
out to his management and customers the impact of the change. At the functional 
requirements level, the systems engineer has substantial control and should 
exercise it. Absolute inflexibility is, of course, highly undesirable, because 
circumstances change and some modifications to functional requirements are 
inevitable. On the other hand, a relaxed attitude in this matter, allowing easy and 
casual change without adequate coordination and review, is an invitation to 
disaster. 
1.3.3 Functional Block Diagram 
The functional block diagram (FBD) is a tool that many people equate with the 
practice of systems engineering. Indeed, the FBD is a highly useful tool for 
visualizing relationships between elements of the system. It is applicable at all 
levels. 
The FBD may be used to demonstrate the relationships of major mission and 
system elements, elements such as spacecraft, ground tracking system, mission 
- operations, facility, user, etc. At the next level, it might be used to indicate the 
interaction of major subsystems within a system. An example is a diagram 
showing the relationship between the major spacecraft subsystems that comprise 
a spacecraft. 
The basic concept can be carried to as low a level as desired. A block diagram 
showing the relationships between the major assemblies within a subsystem, e.g., 
solar arrays, batteries, and power conditioning and control electronics within the 
power subsystem, can be most useful. One must be careful not to push it too far, 
however. Although in principle the FBD could be canied to the point of showing 
relationships between individual components, this really is not useful; indeed, it 
can be actively harmful. It must be remembered that once the decision is made 
to create such documentation, it must be maintained as and when the design 
changes. If not current, a given document can be not only irrelevant but also 
damaging. It becomes a source of misinformation, leading to costly and possibly

and a great many specific requirements will remain “to be determined” (TBD).

can be a major task. 
It is easy today to be seduced into creating overly complex and unnecessary 
paper systems. There is a multitude of software available to "help" the manager. 
Once created, these systems seem to take on a life of their own, to expand and 
propagate. Significant amounts of time and money can be wasted in creating 
excessive documentation. The systems engineer should think through the 
documentation requirements for his activity, and implement a plan to meet them. 
Unnecessary "bells and whistles" that do not contribute to meeting the 
established requirements should be avoided, or else they will exact a price later. 
1.3.4 Tradeoff Analysis 
Tradeoff analysis is the essence of mission and system design. The 
combination of requirements, desires, and capabilities that define a mission and 
the system that accomplishes it rarely fit together smoothly. The goal of the 
system designer is to obtain the best compromise among these factors, to meet the 
requirements as thoroughly as possible, to accommodate various desires, and to 
do so within the technical, financial, and schedule resources available. 
Much has been said and written about how to do tradeoff analyses at the 
system and subsystem level. At one time it was admittedly a heuristic process, in 
plainer terms, a "judgment call." Decisions were made through the application of 
experience and intuition applied to the desires and requirements, the analytical 
results, and the available test data. More recently, what has become virtually a 
new industry has arisen to "systemize" (some would say "legitimize") the 
process. Elaborate mathematical decision-theoretic analyses and the computers 
to implement them are now commonplace. It is debatable whether better results 
are achieved in this fashion; without doubt, it has led to greater diffusion of 
responsibility for decisions. This can hardly be a virtue, since any engineer 
worthy of the name must be willing to stand behind his work. In the case of the 
systems engineer, his work consists of the decisions he makes. 
What is sometimes overlooked is the fact that, even with the use of computer 
analyses, engineering decisions are still, at bottom, based on the judgment of 
individuals or groups who determine the weighting factors, figures of merit, and 
algorithms that go into the models. Although technical specialists in various 
subsystems provide the expertise in their particular areas, it is the responsibility 
of the systems engineer to ensure that all pertinent factors are included and 
properly weighted. This should not be construed as an argument against the use of 
computers or any other labor-saving device allowing a more detailed analysis to 
be done, or a wider range of options to be explored. It is rather to point out that 
such means are only useful with the proper inputs, and in the hands of one with 
the knowledge and understanding to evaluate the output intelligently. 
It may be instructive to consider some examples of tradeoffs in which a 
systems engineer might become involved. Note that we do not give the answers

per se, merely the problems and some of the considerations involved in solving 
them. As we have indicated, there is rarely only one right answer. The answer, a 
completed system design, will be specific to the circumstances. 
1.3.4.1 Spacecraft propulsion trades. Onboard spacecraft propulsion 
requirements vary widely, ranging from trajectory correction maneuvers of 100 
or 200 m/s, to orbit insertion burns requiring a change in velocity (AV) on 
the order of 1000-2000m/s. Options for meeting these requirements may 
include solid propulsion, liquid monopropellant or bipropellant, or some form of 
electric propulsion. Some missions may employ a combination of these. 
Solid motors have the virtue of being simple and reliable. The specific impulse 
(see Chapter 5) is not as high as for most bipropellant systems, but the mass ratio 
(preburn to postburn mass; again see Chapter 5) is usually better. If the mission 
requires a single large impulse, a solid may be the best choice. However, 
relatively high acceleration is typical with such motors, which may not be 
acceptable for a delicate structure in a deployed configuration. 
A requirement for multiple maneuvers usually dictates the use of a liquid- 
propulsion system. The choice of a monopropellant or bipropellant is not 
necessarily obvious, however. The specific impulse of monopropellants tends to 
be one-half to two-thirds that of bipropellants; however, a monopropellant system 
has half the number of valves and tanks, and operates with a cooler thrust 
chamber. For a given total impulse, the mass of monopropellant carried must be 
greater, but the total propulsion system mass, not merely the propellant mass, is 
the relevant quantity. It will also be true that, if launch vehicle capability allows 
it, the greater simplicity of a monopropellant system may favor this choice even 
for relatively large AV requirements. Often a solid rocket will provide the major 
velocity change, wherease low-thrust mono- or bipropellant system will provide 
thrust vector control during the solid burn, as well as subsequent orbit 
maintenance and correction maneuvers. 
Electric propulsion offers very low thrust and very high specific impulse. 
Obviously it is most attractive on vehicles .that have considerable electric power 
available. Applications requiring continuous low thrust for long periods, very 
high impulse resolution (small "impulse bits"), or minimum propellant 
consumption may favor these systems. Some examples that have been identified 
are communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit (see Chapter 2), where 
long-period, low-impulse stationkeeping requirements exist, and comet 
rendezvous missions, where the total impulse needed exceeds that available 
with chemical propulsion systems.

per se, merely the problems and some of the considerations involved in solving
them. As we have indicated, there is rarely only one right answer. The answer, a
completed system design, will be specific to the circumstances.

1.3.4.1 Spacecraft propulsion trades. Onboard spacecraft propulsion
requirements vary widely, ranging from trajectory correction maneuvers of 100
or 200 m/s, to orbit insertion burns requiring a change in velocity (AV) on
the order of 1000-2000 m/s. Options for meeting these requirements may
include solid propulsion, liquid monopropellant or bipropellant, or some form of
electric propulsion. Some missions may employ a combination of these.

Solid motors have the virtue of being simple and reliable. The specific impulse
(see Chapter 5) is not as high as for most bipropellant systems, but the mass ratio
(preburn to postburn mass; again see Chapter 5) is usually better. If the mission
requires a single large impulse, a solid may be the best choice. However,
relatively high acceleration is typical with such motors, which may not be
acceptable for a delicate structure in a deployed configuration.

A requirement for multiple maneuvers usually dictates the use of a liquid-
propulsion system. The choice of a monopropellant or bipropellant is not
necessarily obvious, however. The specific impulse of monopropellants tends to
be one-half to two-thirds that of bipropellants; however, a monopropellant system
has half the number of valves and tanks, and operates with a cooler thrust
chamber. For a given total impulse, the mass of monopropellant carried must be
greater, but the total propulsion system mass, not merely the propellant mass, is
the relevant quantity. It will also be true that, if launch vehicle capability allows
it, the greater simplicity of a monopropellant system may favor this choice even
for relatively large AV requirements. Often a solid rocket will provide the major
velocity change, whereas a low-thrust mono- or bipropellant system will provide
thrust vector control during the solid burn, as well as subsequent orbit
maintenance and correction maneuvers.

Electric propulsion offers very low thrust and very high specific impulse.
Obviously it is most attractive on vehicles that have considerable electric power
available. Applications requiring continuous low thrust for long periods, very
high impulse resolution (small “impulse bits”), or minimum propellant
consumption may favor these systems. Some examples that have been identified
are communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit (see Chapter 2), where
long-period, low-impulse stationkeeping requirements exist, and comet
rendezvous missions, where the total impulse needed exceeds that available
with chemical propulsion systems.

1.3.4.2 Communications system trades. Telecommunications
requirements are driven by the amount of information to be transmitted,
the time available to do so, and the distance over which it must be sent. Given
the required data rate, the tradeoff devolves to one between antenna gain (which,
if it is a parabolic dish, translates directly to size) and broadcast power. In the

present discussion, we assume that the antenna is a parabolic dish. For a given 
data rate and a specified maximum bit error rate with known range and power, the 
required antenna size is a function of operating frequency. 
Antenna size can easily become a problem, because packaging for launch may 
be difiicult or impossible. Antennas that fold for launch and are deployed for 
operation in space may avoid the packaging difficulty, but introduce cost and 
reliability problems. Also, such antennas are of necessity usually rather flexible, 
which, for large sizes, may result in rather poor figure control. Without good 
figure control, the potential gain of a large antenna cannot be realized. Larger 
antennas have other problems as well. Increased gain (with any antenna) implies 
a reduced beamwidth that results in a requirement for more accurate antenna 
and/or spacecraft pointing knowledge and stability. This can reverberate through 
the system, often causing overall spacecraft cost and complexity to increase. 
Orientation accuracy for many spacecraft is driven by the requirements of the 
communications system. 
Higher broadcast power allows use of a smaller antenna, but will naturally 
have a significant effect on the power subsystem, increasing mass and solar array 
size. If flightqualified amplifiers of adequate power do not exist, expensive 
development and qualification of new systems must be initiated. 
Use of higher frequencies (e-g., X-band as opposed to S-band) allows 
increased data rates for a given antenna size and power, but, because the effective 
gain of the dish is higher at higher frequencies, again there results a requirement 
for increased pointing accuracy. Also, if communication with ground stations 
must be guaranteed, the use of high frequencies can become a problem. Heavy 
rain can attenuate X-band signals significantly and may obliterate higher 
frequencies such as Ka- or Ku-band. 
In the final analysis, the solution may not lie witbin the hardware design at all. 
More sophis&ated onboard processing or data encoding can reduce the amount 
of data that need to be transmitted to achieve the same information transfer (or 
reduce the bit error rate), to a point compatible with constraints on power, mass, 
antenna size, and frequency. Of course, this alternative is not free either. More 
computational capability will be required, and careful (e.g., expensive) prelaunch 
analysis must be done to ensure that the data are not unacceptably degraded in the 
process. The cost of developing and qualifying the software for onboard 
processing is also a factor to be considered. 
1.3.4.3 Power system trades. Spacecraft power sources to date have 
been limited to choices between solar photovoltaic, isotope-heated 
thennoelectric, and chemical (batteries or fuel cells) sources. Generally 
speaking, batteries or fuel cells are acceptable as sole power sources only for 
short-duration missions, measured in terms of days or at most a few weeks.

used as close to the sun as the orbit of Mercury, although careful attention to 
thermal control is required. New technology in materials and fabrication will 
allow use even closer than the Mercury orbit. Such arrays can provide power as 
far out as the inner regions of the asteroid belt. With concentrators, they may be 
useful as far from the sun as the orbit of Jupiter, although the complexity of 
deployable concentrators has limited interest in these devices until recently. In 
the future, man-tended assembly or deployment in space may, render such

For long missions far from the sun, or for missions requiring full operation

(RTG) have been the choice (as with Voyager 1 and 2, the Viking landers, and the

probably possible, but present a variety of problems in terms of drag, 
maneuverability, articulation control, interaction with spacecraft attitude control, A

advantage of the higher efficiency of such thermodynamic cycles as compared to

Nuclear power plants (reactors) offer great promise for the future, offering a 
combination of high power at moderate weight for long periods. As will be

obtaining approval for launch. In the final analysis, the spacecraft designer must 
trade off the characteristics and requirements of all systems to choose the best 
power source or combination of sources for his mission.

his favored approach, often with little regard to its system value. The task of the 
systems engineer is to evaluate the overall impact of these concepts on all of 
the other subsystems and upon the integrated system before making a selection.

using new vs existing technology. The systems engineer is often caught between 
opposing forces in this matter. On one side is program and project management, 
who, in general, are primarily interested in completing the job on schedule, 
within budget, and with minimum uncertainty. To this end, management tends to 
apply pressure to "do what you did last time;" i.e., minimize the introduction of 
new concepts or technology with their attendant risk and uncertainty. 
On the other side is a host of technical specialists responsible for the various

To maximize capability, remain competitive, encourage new development, etc., 
it is clearly desirable to apply new technology when possible. Yet one must avoid 
being seduced by a promise or potential that is not yet real. It is almost axiomatic

ultimately successful, be both late and expensive. 
In a properly managed program it will be the lot of the systems engineer either 
to make the technology decision or to make recommendations to management so 
that the issue can be properly decided. Many issues must be considered in this 
matter; some of these will be discussed in the remainder of this section. 
The lint question to be addressed is the most basic: "Will the existing 
technology do the job?' If a well-understood technology embodied in existing 
systems will do everything required with a comfortable margin, then there is little 
incentive to do somethhig new merely because it is new. On the other hand, if 
the task mandates the use of new technology to be accomplished at all, the 
decision is again obvious. It then becomes the task of the systems engineer to I

3 effectively a new system design, and in all likelihood actually increasing 
overall costs. 
This example points to a major risk associated with the introduction of new 
technology and emphasizes the need for the systems engineer to focus on the 
complete system, and upon the unforeseen ways in which changes in a subsystem 
may propagate. A subsystem engineer might propose introduction of a new 
technology item in his subsystem after the design is well advanced. The 
advantages cited might be higher efficiency, greater capability, or just the fact 
that it is the latest technology. It will probably be argued that the cost increase 
within the subsystem will be small or nonexistent. The subsystem engineer's 
interest (and the depth of his argument) will usually end at that point. The systems 
engineer must look beyond this, addressing other questions that include, but are 
not necessarily limited to, some of the following: If ground support and test 
equipment already exist, will they be compatible with the new change, or will 
extensive modifications be required? Will new or special test and handling 
requirements be invoked (e.g., static electricity precautions, inert gas purge, 
etc.)? Probably the most important questions relate to the effect on other 
subsystems. Is this change truly transparent to them, or will new requirements 
(e.g., noise limits, special power requirements or restrictions, etc.) be imposed? 
Will the new item affect mission planning because of greater radiation sensitivity 
(or require shielding mass, which negates some of the purported advantages)? 
Failure to assess these issues early, and to coordinate with the designers of other 
subsystems during the decision process, can lead to very costly surprises later. 
Another area of concern is that of the actual availability of components based 
on the new technology. Demonstrations in the laboratory, even fabrication of test 
components, do not correspond to actual production availability. Even if 
commercial parts are available. the spacequalified units required for most 
projects may not be. Thus, commitment to the new item could imply that the 
system engineer's project must pay the cost of establishing a production line or a 
space-qualification program. This may not only be costly, but may also. be 
incompatible with the project schedule. 
Of course, the issue of component availability question has two sides. It may 
I be equally difficult to obtain older components if several years have passed since 
their previous use in an application. This is especially true in the rapidly evolving 
electronics component field. A case in point is that of the Voyager spacecraft, in 
I which it was desired to duplicate many electronic subsystems from the Viking 
Orbiter. To the dismay of project management, it was found that the manufacturer 
1 was terminating production of certain critical integrated circuits, and was not 
interested in keeping the line open in order to produce the relatively small volume 
of parts needed. Because the redesign necessary to incorporate new components 
would have been both expensive and late, the project paid to maintain the 
production line for the required parts. In a more recent example, space shuttle 
program officials have found it necessary to resort to on-line auctions to identify 
and procure what are, as of the earIy twenty-first century, quite outmoded parts.

Mission Design 
2.1 Introduction 
Space vehicle design requirements do not, except in very basic terms, have an 
existence that is independent of the mission to be performed. In fact, it is almost 
trivial to note that the type of mission to be flown and the performance 
requirements that are imposed define the spacecraft design that results. Just as a 
wide variety of aircraft exist to satisfy different broad classes of tasks, so may 
most space missions be categorized as belonging to one or another general type of 
flight. Missions to near Earth orbit, for example, will impose fundamentally 
different design requirements than planetary exploration missions, no matter 
what the end goal in each case. In this chapter we examine a variety of different 
mission classes, with a view to the high-level considerations that are thus 
imposed on the vehicle design process. 
2.2 Low Earth Orbit 
Low Earth orbit (LEO) can be loosely defined as any orbit that is below 
perhaps 1000 km, or generally below the inner Van Allen radiation belt. By far 
the majority of space missions flown to date have been to LEO, and it is probable 
that this trend will continue. Examples of LEO missions include flight tests, Earth 
observations for scientific, military, meteorological, and other utilitarian 
purposes, and observations of local or deep space phenomena. Future missions 
can be expected to have similar goals plus the addition of new classes for purely 
commercial purposes. Indeed, the first generation of such commercial missions 
began appearing at the turn of the century, which saw the advent of global voice 
and data networks in LEO, commercial FM radio broadcasting, and the first 
purely commercial Earth observation and photoreconnaissance satellites. The 
fact that none of the business ventures founded on these mission concepts has yet 
proved profitable has delayed more aggressive efforts to exploit the LEO 
environment. Nonetheless, it is widely believed that the purely commercial use of 
near-Earth space can only grow. Further examples of such missions may include 
delivery service to the International Space Station, space materials processing, 
and more sophisticated Earth resource survey spacecraft.

Mission Design

2.1. Introduction

Space vehicle design requirements do not, except in very basic terms, have an
existence that is independent of the mission to be performed. In fact, it is almost
trivial to note that the type of mission to be flown and the performance
requirements that are imposed define the spacecraft design that results. Just as a
wide variety of aircraft exist to satisfy different broad classes of tasks, so may
most space missions be categorized as belonging to one or another general type of
flight. Missions to near Earth orbit, for example, will impose fundamentally
different design requirements than planetary exploration missions, no matter
what the end goal in each case. In this chapter we examine a variety of different
mission classes, with a view to the high-level considerations that are thus
imposed on the vehicle design process.

2.2 Low Earth Orbit

Low Earth orbit (LEO) can be loosely defined as any orbit that is below
perhaps 1000 km, or generally below the inner Van Allen radiation belt. By far
the majority of space missions flown to date have been to LEO, and it is probable
that this trend will continue. Examples of LEO missions include flight tests, Earth
observations for scientific, military, meteorological, and other utilitarian
purposes, and observations of local or deep space phenomena. Future missions
can be expected to have similar goals plus the addition of new classes for purely

2.2.1 Fljght Tests 
In the early days of orbital flight, every mission was in some sense a flight test, 
regardless of its primary goals, simply because of the uncertainty in technology 
and procedures. With increasing technical and operational maturity, however, 
many missions have become essentially routine. In such cases, flight tests are 
conducted only for qualification of new vehicles, systems, or techniques. 
Flight testsin general are characterized by extensive instrumentation packages 
devoted to checking vehicle or system performance. Mission profiles are often 
more complex than for an operational mission because of the desire to verify as 
many modes of operation as possible. There is a close analogy with aircraft flight 
testing, where no real payload is carried and the performance envelope is explored 
to extremes that are not expected to be encountered under ordinary conditions. 
An important difference arises in that aircraft testing will involve many hours of 
operation over many flights, probably with a number of test units. Space systems, on 
the other hand, are usually restricted to one or very few test units and one flight per 
operational unit. It is interesting to recall that Apollo 11, the first lunar landing 
mission, was only the fifth manned flight using the command module, the third to 
use a lunar module, and in fact only the 21st U.S. manned mission. The space shunle 
provides the first instance of multiple flight tests of the same unit. Even in this case, 
the number of test flights was very low by aircraft standards, with the vehicle having 
been declared "operational" after only four flights. As this is written, 113 space 
shuttle missions have been flown, with no single crewmember having been on more 
than seven flights. One can hardly imagine, for example, Lindbergh having flown 
the Atlantic on the basis of such limited experience. 
Because of the limited number of fiight tests usually allowed for space 
systems, it is essential that a maximum value be obtained from each one. Not only 
must the mission profile be designed for the fullest possible exercise of the 
system, but the instrumentation package must provide the maximum return. LEO 
offers an excellent environment for test missions. The time to reach orbit is short, 
the energy expenditure is as low as possible for a space mission, communication 
is nearly instantaneous, and many hours of flight operation may be accumulated 
by a single launch to orbit. 
As indicated earlier, the Apollo manned lunar program is an excellent example 
of this type of testing. The various vehicles and procedures were put through a 
series of unmanned and manned exercises in LEO prior to lunar orbit testing and 
the lunar landing. Even the unmanned first flight of the Saturn S/Apollo 
command service module (CSM) illustrates the philosophy of striving for 
maximum return on each flight. This flight featured an "all-up" test of the three 
Saturn 5 stages, plus restart of the third stage in Earth orbit, as required for a lunar 
mission, followed by a reentry test of the Apollo command module. Viewed as a 
daring (and spectacularly successful) gamble at the time, it is seen in retrospect 
that little if any additional program risk was incurred. If the first stage had failed, 
nothing would have been learned about the second and higher stages-exactly

2.2.1 Flight Tests

In the early days of orbital flight, every mission was in some sense a flight test,
regardless of its primary goals, simply because of the uncertainty in technology
and procedures. With increasing technical and operational maturity, however,
many missions have become essentially routine. In such cases, flight tests are
conducted only for qualification of new vehicles, systems, or techniques.

Flight tests.in general are characterized by extensive instrumentation packages
devoted to checking vehicle or system performance. Mission profiles are often
more complex than for an operational mission because of the desire to verify as
many modes of operation as possible. There is a close analogy with aircraft flight
testing, where no real payload is carried and the performance envelope is explored
to extremes that are not expected to be encountered under ordinary conditions.

An important difference arises in that aircraft testing will involve many hours of
operation over many flights, probably with a number of test units. Space systems, on
the other hand, are usually restricted to one or very few test units and one flight per
operational unit. It is interesting to recall that Apollo 11, the first lunar landing
mission, was only the fifth manned flight using the command module, the third to
use a lunar module, and in fact only the 21st U.S. manned mission. The space shuttle
provides the first instance of multiple flight tests of the same unit. Even in this case,
the number of test flights was very low by aircraft standards, with the vehicle having

Because of the limited number of flight tests usually allowed for space

As indicated earlier, the Apollo manned lunar program is an excellent example
of this type of testing. The various vehicles and procedures were put through a
series of unmanned and manned exercises in LEO prior to lunar orbit testing and
the lunar landing. Even the unmanned first flight of the Saturn 5/Apollo
command service module (CSM) illustrates the philosophy of striving for
maximum return on each flight. This flight featured an “all-up” test of the three
Saturn 5 stages, plus restart of the third stage in Earth orbit, as required for a lunar
mission, followed by a reentry test of the Apollo command module. Viewed as a

that little if any additional program risk was incurred. If the first stage had failed,
nothing would have been learned about the second and higher stages—exactly

the situation if dummy upper stages had been used until a first stage of proven 
reliability had been obtained. Moreover, a failure in any higher stage would still 
have resulted in obtaining more information than would have been the case with 
dummy upper stages. Of course, the cost of all-up testing can be much higher if 
repeated failures are incurred. However, even here equipment costs must be 
traded off against manpower costs incurred when extra flights are included to 
allow a more graduated testing program. Even if equipment costs alone are 
considered, one must note that, when testing upper stages, many perfectly good 
lower stages must be used to provide the correct flight environment. 
The systematic flight-test program for Apollo, leading to a lunar landing after 
a series of manned and unmanned flights, is apparent in Table 2.1. This table is 
not a complete summary of all Apollo flight tests. Between 1961 and 1966 
some 10 Saturn 1 flights were conducted, of which three were used to launch the 
Pegasus series of scientific missions. Also, two pad-abort and four high-altitude

tests of the Apollo lauich escape system were conducted during this period. 
However, only "boilerplate" versions of the Apollo spacecraft were used for 
these missions, and only the fist stage of the Saturn 1 was ever employed for a 
manned flight, and even then its use was not crucial to the program. Adding the 
third stage of the Saturn 5 (the S-IVB) to an upgraded Saturn 1 first stage resulted 
in the Saturn 1B mentioned in the table. Table 2.1 summarizes the tests conducted 
involving major use of flight hardware. 
As may be seen in Table 2.1, one class of flight test that does not actually 
require injection into orbit is entry vehicle testing. There is seldom any advantage 
to long-term orbital flight for such tests. The entry must be flown in some 
approximation of real time, and an instrumented range is often desired. 
Therefore, such tests are usually suborbital ballistic lobs with the goal of placing 
the entry vehicle on some desired trajectory. Propulsion may be applied on the 
descending leg to achieve high entry velocity on a relatively short flight. This 
was, in fact, done on the previously mentioned unmanned Apollo test flights to 
simulate lunar return conditions. Note that such flight tests may not be required to 
match precisely the geometry and velocity of a "real-life" mission. If the main 
parameter of interest is, for example, heat flux into the shield, this may be 
achieved at lower velocity by flying a lower-altitude profile than would be the 
case for the actual mission. 
Entry flight tests are often performed in the Earth's atmosphere for the purpose 
of simulating a planetary entry. Typically, it is impossible to simulate the 
complete entry profile because of atmospheric and other differences; however, 
critical segments may be simulated by careful selection of parameters. The 
Viking Mars entry system and the Galileo probe entry system were both tested in 
this way. The former used a rocket-boosted ballistic flight launched from a 
balloon, while the latter involved a parachute drop from a balloon to study 
parachute deployment dynamics. 
Launch vehicle tests usually involve flying the mission profile while carrying a 
dummy payload. In some cases it is possible to minimize range and operational 
costs by flying a lofted trajectory that does not go full range or into orbit. For 
example, propulsion performance, staging, and guidance and control for an 
orbital vehicle can be demonstrated on a suborbital, high-angle, intercontinental 
ballistic missile (ICBM) like flight. 
2.2.2 Earth Observation 
Earth observation missions cover the full gamut from purely scientific to 
completely utilitarian. Both extremes may be concerned with observations of the 
surface, the atmosphere, the magnetosphere, or the interior of the planet, and of 
the interactions of these entities among themselves or with their solar system 
environment. 
Missions concerned with direct observation of the surface and atmosphere are 
generally placed in low circular orbits to minimize the observation distance.

Earth observation missions cover the full gamut from purely scientific to
completely utilitarian. Both extremes may be concerned with observations of the
surface, the atmosphere, the magnetosphere, or the interior of the planet, and of
the interactions of these entities among themselves or with their solar system
environment. .

Missions concerned with direct observation of the surface and atmosphere are
generally placed in low circular orbits to minimize the observation distance.

MISSION DESIGN 21 
Selecting an orbit altitude is generally a compromise among field of view, ground 
track spacing, observational swath width, and the need to maintain orbit stability 
against atmospheric drag without overly frequent propulsive corrections or 
premature mission termination. In some cases the orbital period may be a factor 
because of the need for synchronization with a station or event on the surface. In 
other cases the orbital period may be required to be such that an integral number 
of orbits occur in a day or a small number of days. This is particularly the case 
with navigation satellites and photoreconnaissance spacecraft. 
Orbital inclination is usually driven by a desire to cover specific latitudes, 
sometimes compromised by launch vehicle and launch site azimuth constraints. For 
full global coverage, polar or near-polar orbits are required. Military observation 
satellites make frequent use of such orbits, often in conjunction with orbit altitudes 
chosen to produce a period that is a convenient fraction of the day or week, thus 
producing very regular coverage of the globe. In many cases it is desired to make all 
observations or photographs at the same local sun angle or time (e.g., under 
conditions that obtain locally at, say, 1030 hrs). As will be discussed in Chapter 4, 
orbital precession effects due to the perturbing influence of Earth's equatorial bulge 
may be utilized to provide this capability. A near-polar, slightly retrograde orbit 
with the proper altitude will precess at the same angular rate as the Earth revolves 
about the sun, thus maintaining constant sun angle throughout the year. 
The LEO missions having the most impact on everyday life are weather 
satellites. Low-altitude satellites provide close-up observations, which, in 
conjunction with global coverage by spacecraft in high orbit, provide the basis for 
our modem weather forecasting and reporting system. Such spacecraft are placed 
in the previously mentioned sun-synchronous orbits of sufficient altitude for 
long-term stability. The Television and Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) 
series has dominated this field since the 1960s, undergoing very substantial 
technical evolution in that time. These satellites are operated by the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Department of Defense 
operates similar satellites under a program called the Defense Meteorological 
Support Program (DMSP). 
Ocean survey satellites, of which SEASAT was an early exaniple, have 
requirements similar to those of the weather satellites. All of these vehicles aim 
most of their instruments toward the region directly beneath the spacecraft or near 
its ground track. Such spacecraft are often referred to as "nadir-pointed." 
Many military missions flown for observational purposes are similar in 
general requirements and characteristics to those discussed earlier. Specific 
requirements may be quite different, being driven by particular payload and 
target considerations. 
Missions dedicated to observation of the magnetic field, radiation belts, etc., 
will usually tend to be in elliptical orbits because of the desire to map tbe given 
phenomena in terms of distance fiom the Earth as well as over a wide latitude 
band. For this reason, substantial orbital eccentricity and a variety of orbital 
inclinations may be desired. Requirements by the payload range from simple

Many satellites require elliptic orbits for other reasons. It may be desired to 
operate at very low altitudes either to sample the upper atmosphere (as with the 
Atmospheric Explorer series) or to get as close as possible to a particular point on 
the Earth for high resolution. In such cases, higher ellipticity is required to obtain 
orbit stability, because a circular orbit at the desired periapsis altitude might last 
only a few hours. 
2.2.3 Space Observation 
Space observation has fully matured with our ability to place advanced scientific 
payloads in orbit. Gone are the days when the astronomer was restricted essentially 
to the visible spectrum. From Earth orbit we can examine space and the bodies 
contained therein across the full spectral range and with resolution no longer 
severely limited by the atmosphere. (The Mount Palomar telescope has a 
diffraction-limited resolving power some 20 times better than can be realized in 
practice because of atmospheric turbulence.) This type of observation took its first 
steps with balloons and sounding rockets, but came to full maturity with orbital 
vehicles. 
Predictably, our sun was one of the first objects to be studied with space-based 
instruments, and interest in the subject continues unabated. Spacecraft have 
ranged from the Orbiting Solar Observatory to the impressive array of solar 
observation equipment that was carried on the manned Skylab mission. Orbits are 
generally characterized by the desire that they be high enough that drag and 
atmospheric effects can be ignored. Inclination is generally not critical, although 
in some cases it may be desired to orbit in the ecliptic plane. If features on the sun 
itself are to be studied, fairly accurate pointing requirements are necessary, 
because the solar disk subtends only 0.5 deg of arc as seen from Earth. 
Many space observation satellites are concerned with mapping the sky in 
.various wavelengths, looking for specific sources, and/or the universal 
background. Satellites have been flown to study spectral regimes from gamma 
radiation down to infrared wavelengths so low that the detectors are cooled to 
near absolute zero to allow them to function. An excellent example is the highly 
successful Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft, with liquid helium 
at 4.2 K used for cooling. COBE has enabled astronomers to verify the very high 
degree of uniformity that exists in the 3-K background radiation left over from 
the "big bang" formation of the universe, and also to identify just enough non- 
uniformity in that background to account for the formation of the galaxies we 
observe today. In the x-ray band, the High Energy Astronomical Observatory 
(HEAO-2) spacecraft succeeded in producing the first high-resolution 
(comparable to ground-based optical telescopes) pictures of the sky and various 
sources at these wavelengths. The more sophisticated Chandra spacecraft, 
operating in a highly elliptic orbit, greatly extends this capability. Although most

24 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Space-processing payloads to date have been small and experimental in 
nature. Such payloads have flown on several Russian missions and on U.S. 
missions on sounding rockets, Skylab, and the shuttle. The advent of the shuttle, 
with its more routine access to LEO, has resulted in substantial increases in the 
number of experiments being planned and flown. The shuttle environment has 
made it possible for such experiments to be substantially less constrained by 
spacecraft design considerations than in the past. Furthermore, it is now possible 
for a "payload specialist" from the sponsoring organization to fly as a shuttle 
crew member with only minimal training. The International Space Station (ISS) 
is expected to replace the shuttle as the base for on-orbit experiments. As this is 
written, fiscal constraints on the ISS are severely eroding crew size and 
equipment capability, placing the ability of the space station to carry out 
meaningful experiments in question. In any case, most of the shuttle launch 
capacity will be consumed in the ISS assembly support for a number of years. 
Because manned vehicles, whether space stations or shuttle, are subject to 
disturbances caused by the presence of the crew, it seems likely that processing 
stations will evolve into shuttle-deployed free flyers to achieve the efficiency of 
continuous operation and tighter control over the environment (important for 
many manufacturing processes) than would be possible in the multi-user shuttle 
environment. Such stations would require periodic replenishment of feedstock 
and removal of the products. This might be accomplished with the shuttle or other 
vehicles as dictated by economics and the current state of the art. In any case, it 
introduces a concept previously seldom considered in spacecraft design: the 
transport and handling of bulk cargo. Space processing and manufacturing has 
not evolved as rapidly as expected. However, the potential is still there and 
eventual development of such capability .seems likely. 
Autonomy, low recurrent cost, and reliability will probably be the hallmarks 
of such delivery systems. The Russian Progress series of resupply vehicles used 
in the Salyut and Mir space station programs, and now in the resupply of the ISS, 
may be viewed as early attempts in the design of vehicles of this type. However, 
the Progress vehicles still depend on the station crew to 'effect most of the cargo 
transfer (though liquid fuel was transferred to Mir essentially without crew ' 
involvement). It may be desirable for economic reasons to have future resupply 
operations of this nature carried out by unmanned vehicles. This will add 
some interesting challenges to the design of spacecraft systems. It seems certain 
that there will be a strong and growing need for robotics technology and 
manufacturing methods in astronautics. 
In the longer term, the high-energy aspects of the space environment may be 
as significant as the availability of hard vacuum and Og. The sun produces about 
1400 w/m2 at Earth, and this power is essentially uninterrupted for many orbits 
of possible future interest. The advance of solar energy collection and storage 
technology cannot fail to have an impact on the economic feasibility of orbital 
manufacturing operations. In this same vein, it is also clear that the requirement

certain that, in the long term, development of unmanned freighter vehicles 
capable of returning lunar or asteroid materials to Earth orbit will be undertaken. 
With the advent of this technology, and the use of solar energy, the economic 
advantage in many manufacturing operations could fall to products manufactured 
in geosynchronous or other high Earth orbits. 
2.3 Medium-Altitude Earth Orbit 
In the early days of the space program, most Earth-orbiting spacecraft were 
either in low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit. More recently, however, there 
has been increasing interest in intermediate orbits, i.e., those with a 12-h period 
(half-geosynchronous). The Global Positioning System (GPS), an array of 
satellites supporting the increasingly crucial GPS navigation system, is located in 
this orbital regime. These orbits avoid the dangerous inner radiation belt but are 
significantly deeper in the outer belt than geostationary satellites and thus 
experience a substantially higher electron flux. 
2.4 Geosynchronous Earth Orbit 
Geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), and particularly the specific geosyn- 
chronous orbit known as geostationary, is some of the most valuable "property" 
in space. The brilliance of Arthur Clarke's foresight in suggesting the use of 
communications satellites in GEO has been amply demonstrated. However, in 
addition to comsats, weather satellites now occupy numerous slots in GEO. 
As the name implies, a spacecraft in GEO is moving in synchrony with the 
Earth, i.e., the orbit period is that of Earth's day, 24 h (actually the 23 h, 56 m, 4 s 
sidereal day, as will be discussed in Chapter 4). This does not imply that the 
satellite appears in a fixed position in the sky from the ground, however. Only in 
the special case of a 24-h circular equatorial orbit will the satellite appear to hover 
in one spot over the Earth. Other synchronous orbits will produce ground tracks 
with average locations that remain over a fixed point; however, there may be 
considerable variation from this average during the 24-h period. The special case 
of the 24-h circular equatorial orbit is properly referred to as geostationary. 
A 24-h circular orbit with nonzero inclination will appear from the ground to 
describe a nodding motion in the sky, that is, it will travel north and south each 
day along the same line of longitude, crossing the equator every 12 h. The latitude 
excursion will, of course, be equal to the orbital inclination. If the orbit is 
equatorial and has a 24-h period but is not exactly circular, it will appear to 
oscillate along the equator, crossing back and forth through lines of longitude. If 
the orbit is both noncircular and of nonzero inclination (the usual case, to a slight 
extent, due to various injection and stationkeeping errors), the spacecraft will

either in low Earth orbit or geosynchronous orbit. More recently, however, there

2.4 Geosynchronous Earth Orbit

Geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), and particularly the specific geosyn-
chronous orbit known as geostationary, is some of the most valuable “property”
in space. The brilliance of Arthur Clarke’s foresight in suggesting the use of
communications satellites in GEO has been amply demonstrated. However, in
addition to comsats, weather satellites now occupy numerous slots in GEO.

As the name implies, a spacecraft in GEO is moving in synchrony with the
Earth, i.e., the orbit period is that of Earth’s day, 24 h (actually the 23 h, 56 m, 4s
sidereal day, as will be discussed in Chapter 4). This does not imply that the
satellite appears in a fixed position in the sky from the ground, however. Only in
the special case of a 24-h circular equatorial orbit will the satellite appear to hover
in one spot over the Earth. Other synchronous orbits will produce ground tracks
with average locations that remain over a fixed point; however, there may be
considerable variation from this average during the 24-h period. The special case
of the 24-h circular equatorial orbit is properly referred to as geostationary.

A 24-h circular orbit with nonzero inclination will appear from the ground to
describe a nodding motion in the sky, that is, it will travel north and south each
day along the same line of longitude, crossing the equator every 12 h. The latitude
excursion will, of course, be equal to the orbital inclination. If the orbit is
equatorial and has a 24-h period but is not exactly circular, it will appear to
oscillate along the equator, crossing back and forth through lines of longitude. If
the orbit is both noncircular and of nonzero inclination (the usual case, to a slight
extent, due to various injection and stationkeeping errors), the spacecraft will

26 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
appear to describe a figure eight in the sky, oscillating through both latitude and 
longitude about its average point on the equator. If the orbit is highly inclined or 
highly elliptic, then the figure eight will become badly distorted. In all cases, 
however, a true 24-h orbit will appear over the same point on Earth at the same 
time each day. An orbit with a slightly different period will have a slow, 
permanent drift across the sky as seen from the ground. Such slightly non- 
synchronous orbits are used to move spacecraft from one point in GEO to another 
by means of minor trajectory corrections. 
It is also interesting to consider very high orbits that are not synchronous but 
that have periods that are simply related to a 24-h day. Examples are the 12-h and 
48-h orbits. Of interest are the orbits used by the Russian Molniya spacecraft for 
communications relay. Much of Russia lies at very high latitudes, areas that are 
poorly served by geostationary comsats. The Molniya spacecraft use highly 
inclined, highly elliptic orbits with 12-h periods that place them, at the high point 
of their arc, over Russia twice each day for long periods. Minimum time is spent 
over the unused southern latitudes. While in view, communications coverage is 
good, and these orbits are easily reached from the high-latitude launch sites 
accessible to the Russians. The disadvantage, of course, is that some form of 
antenna tracking control is required. 
The utility of the geostationary or very nearly geostationary orbit is of course 
that a communications satellite in such an orbit is always over the same point on 
the ground, thus greatly simplifying antenna tracking and ground-space-ground 
relay procedures. Nonetheless, as long as the spacecraft drift is not so severe as to 
take it out of sight of a desired relay point, antenna tracking control is reasonably 
simple and is not a severe operational constraint, so that near-geostationary orbits 
are also quite valuable. The same feature is also important with weather satellites; 
it is generally desired that a given satellite be able to have essentially continuous 
coverage of a given area on the ground, and it is equally desirable that ground 
antennas be readily able to find the satellite in the sky. 
The economic value of such orbits was abundantly emphasized during the 
1979 World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-79), when large groups of 
underdeveloped nations, having little immediate prospect of using geostationary 
orbital slots, nonetheless successfully prosecuted their claims for reservations of 
these slots for future use. Of concern was the possibility that, by the time these 
nations were ready to use the appropriate technology, the geostationary orbit 
would be too crowded to admit further spacecraft. With present-day technology 
and political realities, this concern is somewhat valid. There are limits on the 
proximity within which individual satellites may be placed. 
The first limitation is antenna beamwidth. With reasonably sized ground 
antennas, at frequencies now in use (mostly C-band; see Chapter 12), the antenna 
beamwidth is about 3 deg. To prevent inadvertent commanding of the wrong 
satellite, international agreements limit geostationary satellite spacing to 3 deg.

has become severe. A trend to higher frequencies and other improvements

(receiver selectivity and the ability to reject signals not of one's own modulation 
method are factors here) has allowed a reduction to 2-deg spacing, which 
alleviates but does not eliminate the problem. Political problems also appear, in 
that each country wants its own autonomous satellite, rather than to be part of a 
communal platform, a step that could eliminate the problem of inadvertent 
commands by using a central controller. 
There is also the increasing potential of a physical hazard. Older satellites 
have worn out and, without active stationkeeping, will drift in orbit, posing a 
hazard to other spacecraft. Also, jettisoned launch stages and other hardware are 
in near-GEO orbits. All of this drifting hardware constitutes a hazard to operating 
systems, which is increasing due to the increasing size of newer systems. There is 
evidence that some collisions have already occurred. Mission designers are 
sensitive to the problem, and procedures are often implemented, upon retiring a 
satellite from active use, to lift it out of geostationary orbit prior to shutdown. 
2.4.1 Communications Satellites 
Of all the facets of space technology, the one that has most obviously affected 
the everyday life of the average citizen is the communications satellite, so much 
so that it is now taken for granted. In the early 1950s a tightly scheduled plan 
involving helicopters and transatlantic aircraft was devised to transport films of 
the coronation of Queen Elizabeth 11 so that it could be seen on U.S. television the 
next day. In contrast, the 1981 wedding of Prince Charles was telecast live all 
over the world without so much as a comment on the fact of its possibility. Today, 
most adults cannot recall any other environment. Less spectacular, but having 
even greater impact, is the ease and reliability of long distance business and 
private communication by satellite. Gone are the days of "putting in" a 
transcontinental or transoceanic phone call and waiting for the operator to call 
back hours later. Today, direct dialing to most developed countries is routine, and 
we are upset only when the echo-canceling feature does not work properly. 
The communications satellites that have brought about this revolution are to 
the spacecraft designer quite paradoxical, in the sense that in many ways they are 
quite simple (we exclude, of course, the communications gear itself, which is 
increasingly capable of feats of signal handling and processing that are truly 
remarkable). Because, by definition, a communications satellite is always in 
communication with the ground, such vehicles have required very little in the 
way of autonomous operational capability. Problems can often be detected early 
and dealt with by direct ground command. Orbit placement and correction 
maneuvers can, if desired, be done in an essentially real-time, "fly-by-wire" 
mode. Most of the complexity (and much of the mass) is in the communications 
equipment, which is the raison d'6tre for these vehicles. Given the cost of placing 
a satellite in orbit and the immense commercial value of every channel, the 
tendency is to cram the absolute maximum of communications capacity into

every vehicle. Lifespan and reliability are also important, and reliability is 
usually enhanced by the use of simple designs. 
The value of and demand for communications channels, together with the 
spacing problems discussed earlier, are driving vehicle design in the direction of 
larger, more complex multipurpose communications platforms. Indeed, 
economic reality is pushing us toward the very large stations originally 
envisioned by Clarke for the role, but with capabilities far exceeding anything 
imagined in those days of vacuum tubes, discrete circuit components, and point- 
to-point wiring. Also noteworthy is that comsats thus far have been unmanned. 
This trend will probably continue, although there may be some tendency, once 
very large GEO stations are built, to allow for temporary manned occupancy for 
maintenance or other purposes. Pioneering concepts assumed an essential role for 
man in a communications satellite; as '~larke has said, it was viewed as 
inconceivable (if it was considered at all) that large, complex circuits and systems 
could operate reliably and autonomously for years at a time. 
A high degree of specialization is already developing in comsat systems, 
especially in carefully designed antenna patterns that service specific and often 
irregularly shaped regions on Earth. This trend can be expected to continue in the 
future. The large communications platforms discussed earlier will essentially (in 
terms of size, not complexity) be elaborate antenna farms with a variety of 
specialized antennas operating at different frequencies and aimed at a variety of 
areas on the Earth and at other satellites. 
It will be no surprise that the military services operate comsat systems as well. 
In a number of cases, such as the latest MILSTAR models, these vehicles have 
become quite elaborate, with multiple functions and frequencies. Reliability and 
backup capability are especially important in these applications, as well as 
provision for secure communications. Of interest to the spacecraft design 
engineer is the growing trend toward "hardening" of these spacecraft. In the event 
of war, nuclear or conventional, preservation of communications capability 
becomes essential. Spacecraft generally are rather vulnerable to intense radiation 
pulses, whether from nuclear blasts in space (generating electromagnetic pulses 
as well) or laser radiation from the ground. The use of well-shielded electrical 
circuits and, where possible, fiberoptic circuits can be expected. There is, in fact, 
some evidence of "blinding" of U.S. observation satellites during the Cold War 
years by the then-soviet Union, using ground-based lasers. Designers can also 
expect to see requirements for hardening spacecraft against blast and shrapnel 
from potential "killer" satellites. 
2.4.2 Weather Satellites 
Weather satellites in GEO are the perfect complement to the LEO vehicles 
discussed earlier. High-altitude observations can show cloud, thermal, and 
moisture patterns over roughly one-third of the globe at a glance. This provides

could operate reliably and autonomously for years at a time.

A high degree of specialization is already developing in comsat systems,
especially in carefully designed antenna patterns that service specific and often
irregularly shaped regions on Earth. This trend can be expected to continue in the
future. The large communications platforms discussed earlier will essentially (in
terms of size, not complexity) be elaborate antenna farms with a variety of
specialized antennas operating at different frequencies and aimed at a variety of
areas on the Earth and at other satellites.

It will be no surprise that the military services operate comsat systems as well.
In a number of cases, such as the latest MILSTAR models, these vehicles have
become quite elaborate, with multiple functions and frequencies. Reliability and
backup capability are especially important in these applications, as well as
provision for secure communications. Of interest to the spacecraft design
engineer is the growing trend toward “hardening” of these spacecraft. In the event
of war, nuclear or conventional, preservation of communications capability
becomes essential. Spacecraft generally are rather vulnerable to intense radiation
pulses, whether from nuclear blasts in space (generating electromagnetic pulses
as well) or laser radiation from the ground. The use of well-shielded electrical
circuits and, where possible, fiberoptic circuits can be expected. There is, in fact,
some evidence of “blinding” of U.S. observation satellites during the Cold War
years by the then-Soviet Union, using ground-based lasers. Designers can also
expect to see requirements for hardening spacecraft against blast and shrapnel
from potential “killer” satellites.

2.4.2 Weather Satellites

Weather satellites in GEO are the perfect complement to the LEO vehicles
discussed earlier. High-altitude observations can show cloud, thermal, and
moisture patterns over roughly one-third of the globe at a glance. This provides

MISSION DESIGN 29 
the large-scale context for interpretation of the data from low-altitude satellites, 
aircraft, and surface observations. 
Obviously, it is not necessary for a satellite to be in a geostationary or even a 
geosynchronous orbit to obtain a wide-area view. But, as discussed, it is still 
considered very convenient, and operationally desirable, for the spacecraft to 
stand still in the sky for purposes of continued observation, command, and 
control. Crowding of weather satellites does not present the problems associated 
with comsats, however, because entirely different frequency bands can be 
used for command and control purposes. The only real concern in this case is 
collision avoidance. 
The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) system is an 
excellent example of this type of satellite. Even though the purpose is different, 
many of the requirements of weather and communications satellites are similar, 
and the idea of combined functions, especially on larger platforms, may well 
become attractive in the future. 
2.4.3 Space Observation 
To date, there has been relatively little deep space observation from GEO. 
Generally speaking, there has been little reason to go to this energetically 
expensive orbit for observations from deep space. There are some exceptions; the 
International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) observatory satellite used an elliptic 
geosynchronous orbit with a 24,300-km perigee altitude and a 47,300-km apogee 
altitude. The previously mentioned Chandra telescope uses a similar orbit. Such 
orbits allow more viewing time of celestial objects with less interference from 
Earth's radiation belts than would have been the case for a circular orbit, while 
still allowing the spacecraft to be in continuous view of the Goddard Space Flight 
Center tracking stations. 
At higher altitudes the Earth subtends a smaller arc, and more of the sky is 
visible. This can be important for sensitive optical instruments, which often 
cannot be pointed within many degrees of bright objects like the sun, moon, or 
Earth, because of the degradation of obse~vations resulting from leakage of stray 
light into the optics. As more sensitive observatories for different spectral bands 
proliferate, there may be a desire to place them as far as possible from the radio, 
thermal, and visible Iight noise emanating from Earth. 
A recent example is the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), 
launched in 2001. This mission is the first to use a "halo" orbit about the Sun- 
Earth L2 Lagrange point (see Chapter 4) as a permanent observing station. 
WMAP orbits L2 in an oval pattern every six months, requiring stationkeeping 
maneuvers every few months to remain in position. This allows a complete 
WMAP full-sky observation every six months. As this goes to press, WMAP has 
succeeded in refining the earlier COBE data, allowing the distribution of 
background radiation in the universe to be mapped to within a few millionths 
of a Kelvin.

It will be important with the advent of very large antenna arrays (whether for 
communications or radio astronomy) to minimize gravity-gradient and 
atmospheric disturbances, and this will imply high orbits. 
In this connection, an interesting possibility for the future is the so-called 
Orbiting Deep Space Relay Satellite (ODSRS), which has been studied on 
various occasions under different names. This concept would use a very large 
spacecraft as a replacement or supplement for the existing ground-based Deep 
Space Network (DSN). The DSN currently consists of large dish-antenna 
facilities in California, Australia, and Spain, with the placement chosen so as to 
enable continuous observation and tracking of interplanetary spacecraft 
irrespective of Earth's rotation. 
The ODSRS concept has several advantages. Long-term, continuous tracking 
of a spacecraft would be possible and would not be limited by Earth's rotation. 
Usage of higher frequencies would be possible, thus enhancing data rates and 
narrowing bearnwidths. This in turn would allow spacecraft transmitters to use 
lower power. The atmosphere poses a significant problem to the use of extremely 
high frequencies from Earth-based antennas. Attenuation in some bands is quite 
high, and rain can obliterate a signal (X-band signals are attenuated by some 40 dB 
in the presence of rain). Furthermore, a space-borne receiver can be easily cooled 
to much lower temperatures than is possible on Earth, improving its signal-to- 
noise ratio. The ODSRS would receive incoming signals from deep space and 
relay them to ground at frequencies compatible with atmospheric passage. 
Between tracking assignments, it could have some utility as a radio telescope. 
Spacecraft performing surveys of the atmosphere, radiation b.elts, magnetic 
field, etc., around the Earth may be in synchronous, subsynchronous, or 
supersynchronous orbits that may or may not be circular. This might be done to 
synchronize the spacecraft with some phenomena related to Earth's rotation, 
or simply to bring it over the same ground station each day for data transmission 
or command and control. 
As our sophistication in orbit design grows and experimental or other 
requirements pose new challenges, more complex and subtle orbits involving 
various types of synchrony as well as perturbations and other phenomena will be 
seen. We have only scratched the surface in this fascinating area. 
2.5 Lunar and Deep Space Mlssions 
Missions to the moon and beyond are often very similar to Earth orbital 
missions in terms of basic goals and methods. However, because of the higher 
energy requirements, longer flight times, and infrequent launch opportunities 
available using current propulsion systems, evolution of these missions from the 
basic to the more detailed and utilitarian type has been arrested compared to Earth 
orbital missions. In general, deep space missions fall into one of three categories: 
inner solar system targets, outer solar system targets, and solar orbital.

2.5 Lunar and Deep Space Missions

Missions to the moon and beyond are often very similar to Earth orbital
missions in terms of basic goals and methods. However, because of the higher
energy requirements, longer flight times, and infrequent launch opportunities
available using current propulsion systems, evolution of these missions from the
basic to the more detailed and utilitarian type has been arrested compared to Earth
orbital missions. In general, deep space missions fall into one of three categories:
inner solar system targets, outer solar system targets, and solar orbital.

MISSION DESIGN 31 
2.5. I inner Planetary Missions 
The target bodies included in this category are those from Mercury to the inner 
reaches of the asteroid belt. The energy required to reach these extremes from 
Earth is roughly the same, a vis-viva energy of 30-40 krn2/s2 (see Chapter 4). 
Even though the region encompasses a variation in solar radiative and 
gravitational intensity of about 60, it can be said to be dominated by the sun. 
Within this range, it is feasible to design solar-powered spacecraft and to use 
solar orientation as a factor in thermal control. Flight times to the various targets 
are measured in months, rather than years, for most trajectory designs of interest. 
As would be expected, our first efforts to explore another planet were directed 
toward the nearby moon. Indeed, the first crude efforts by both the United States and 
the USSR to fly by or even orbit the moon came only months after the first Earth 
orbiters. Needless to say, there were at fist more failures than successes. The first 
U.S. Pioneer spacecraft were plagued with various problems and were only partly 
successful. Probably the scientific highlight of this period was the return of the first 
crude images of the unknown lunar farside by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft. The 
lunar program then settled into what might be considered the classic sequence of 
events in the exploration of a planetary body. The early Pioneer flybys were 
followed by the Ranger family, designed to use close-approach photography of a 
single site followed by destruction on impact. Reconnaissance, via the Lunar 
Orbiter series, came next, followed by the Surveyor program of soft landers. Finally, 
manned exploration followed with the ApolIo program. 
Although omitting the hard landers, the Russian (Soviet at that time) program 
followed a similar path, and was clearly building toward manned missions until a 
combination of technical problems and the spectacular Apollo successes 
terminated the effort. A number of notable successes were achieved, however. 
Luna 9 made a "soft" (actually a controlled crash, with cameras encased in an 
airbag sphere for survival) landing on the moon in February 1966, some months 
prior to Surveyor 1. The propaganda impact of this achievement was somewhat 
lessened by the early decoding and release of the returned pictures from Jodrell 
Bank Observatory in England. The Lunokhod series subsequently demonstrated 
autonomous surface mobility, and some of the later Luna landers returned 
samples to Earth, though not before the Apollo landings. 
Exploration of the other inner planets, so far as it has gone, has followed 
essentially the scenario previously outlined. Both the United States and Russia 
have sent flyby and orbital missions to Venus and Mars. The Russians landed a 
series of Venera spacecraft on Venus (where the survival problems dwarf 
anything so far found outside the sun or Jupiter), and the United States achieved 
two spectacularly successful Viking landings (also orbiters) on Mars. Following a 
20-year hiatus after Viking, Mars is once again a focus of U.S. exploration with a 
series of landers, orbiters, and rovers. The holy'grail of sample return is still the 
ultimate goal presently envisioned, with manned flight to Mars consigned to the 
indefinite future.

2.5.1 Inner Planetary Missions

The target bodies included in this category are those from Mercury to the inner
reaches of the asteroid belt. The energy required to reach these extremes from
Earth is roughly the same, a vis-viva energy of 30-40 km? / s* (see Chapter 4).
Even though the region encompasses a variation in solar radiative and
gravitational intensity of about 60, it can be said to be dominated by the sun.
Within this range, it is feasible to design solar-powered spacecraft and to use
solar orientation as a factor in thermal control. Flight times to the various targets
are measured in months, rather than years, for most trajectory designs of interest.

The asteroids have not so far been a major target of planetary science, 
although many mission concepts have been advanced and some preliminary 
efforts have been made. Both Voyager spacecraft, as well as Galileo and Cassini, 
have returned data from flybys of main belt asteroids while en route to the outer 
planets. The first exploration of a near-Earth asteroid was conducted with the 
Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to Eros. NEAR became the 
Iirst spacecraft to orbit an asteroid, and, in a dramatic end-of-life experiment, also 
executed a series of maneuvers resulting in the first soft landing of a spacecraft on 
an asteroid. As this is written, Deep Space 1, an experimental solar electric 
propulsion vehicle, is conducting a series of slow flybys of asteroids. 
The innermost planet, Mercury, has so far been the subject only of flybys and 
even these by only one spacecraft, Mariner 10. The use of a Venus gravity assist 
(see Chapter 4) to reach Mercury, plus the selection of a resonant solar orbit, 
allowed Mariner 10 to make three passes of the.planet. This mission was one of 
the first asrrodynamically complex missions to be flown, involving as it did a 
succession of gravity assist maneuvers, and it was also one of the most successful. 
Mariner 10 provided our first good look at this small, dense, heavily cratered 
member of the solar system. 
Table 2.2 summarizes a few of the key lunar and inner planetary missions to date. 
25.2 Outer Planetary Missjons 
As this is written, the outer planets, except for Pluto, have all been visited, 
though only Jupiter has been the target of an orbiting research satellite, on the 
Galileo mission. Cassini, launched in October 1997 for a July 2004 injection into 
a Saturn orbit, will be the second such outer-planet observatory. This mission is 
planned to deploy the Huygens probe into the atmosphere of Titan, the only 
planetary moon known to possess an atmosphere (other than possibly Charon, 
whose status as either a moon of Pluto, or as the smaller of a double-planetary 
system, is a matter of current debate). 
Pioneers 10 and 11 led the way to the outer planets, with Pioneer 10 flying by 
Jupiter and Pioneer 11 visiting both Jupiter and Saturn. These missions were 
followed by Voyagers 1 and 2, both of which have flown by both Jupiter and 
Saturn, surveying both the planets and many of their moons. The rings of Jupiter 
and several new satellites of Saturn were discovered. All four vehicles acquired 
sufficient energy from the flybys to exceed solar escape velocity, becoming, in 
effect, mankind's first emissaries to the stars. The two Pioneers and Voyager 1 
will not pass another solid body in the foreseeable future (barring the possibility 
of an unknown 10th planet or a "brown dwarf" star), but Voyager 2 carried out a 
Uranus encounter in 1986 and a Neptune flyby in 1989. Achievement of these 
goals is remarkable, because the spacecraft has far exceeded its four-year design 
lifetime. Even though the instrumentation designed for Jupiter and Saturn is not 
optimal at the greater distances of Uranus and Neptune, excellent results were 
achieved.

The Cassini mission design is particularly interesting in its use of gravity-

Cassini's flight time to Saturn is about 6.7 years, which compares very favorably 
with the Hohrnann transfer time of approximately 6 years (see Chapter 4). The 
Hohmann transfer to Saturn requires a AV from Earth parking orbit in excess of 
7 krn/s, and although this is the minimum possible for a two-impulse maneuver, 
it is substantially in excess of that capable of being supplied by any existing upper

expectations arose because of the inability to reconcile the orbits of the outer
planets, particularly Neptune, with the theoretical predictions including all
known perturbations. Both Neptune and Pluto (somewhat fortuitously, it now
seems) were discovered as a result of such observations. Tracking data from the
Pioneers and Voyagers can return more data, and more accurate data, in a few
years than in several centuries of planetary observations. Moreover, because
these spacecraft are departing the solar system at an angle to the ecliptic, they
provide data otherwise totally unobtainable. The Pioneers and the Voyagers were
-still being tracked (sporadically in the case of Pioneers) in the early 2000s, nearly
three decades after launch. Among other things, they are still attempting to
discover boundaries of the heliopause, the interface at which the solar wind gives
way to the interstellar medium.

By the logical sequence outlined previously, Jupiter would be the next target
for an orbiter and an atmospheric probe, as was in fact the case. The Galileo
program achieved these goals, as well as conducting many successive flybys of
the Jovian moons from its Jupiter orbit. Although delayed by many factors,
including the 1986 Challenger accident, Galileo was launched in 1989 on a
circuitous path involving a Venus flyby and two Earth flybys on route to Jupiter.
This complexity is a result of the cancellation of the effort to develop a high-
energy Centaur upper stage for the shuttle, and consequent substitution of a
lower-energy inertial upper stage (IUS).

The Galileo spacecraft has been severely crippled by the failure of its rib-mesh
antenna to deploy fully. As a result, the data rate to Earth, planned to be tens of
kilobits per second, was significantly degraded, greatly curtailing the number of
images returned. Nevertheless, the mission must be rated a huge success because
of the quality of data that has been received.

The Galileo mission was also an astrodynamical tour de force, with a flyby of
one satellite used to target the next in a succession of visits to the Jovian satellites,
all achieved with minimal use of propellant. In complexity it has far eclipsed the
trail-blazing Mariner 10.

As mentioned, Cassini and its Huygens probe follow in the footsteps of the
Galileo Jupiter orbiter and probe. Cassini used an even more complex trajectory
than Galileo, referred to as a Venus—Venus—Earth—Jupiter gravity assist
(VVEJGA) trajectory. Huygens will separate from the Cassini orbiter to enter the
atmosphere of Titan, while Cassini is planned to make at least 30 planetary orbits,
each optimized for a different set of observations.

The Cassini mission design is particularly interesting in its use of gravity-
assist maneuvers to achieve an otherwise unattainable goal. As noted earlier,
Cassini’s flight time to Saturn is about 6.7 years, which compares very favorably
with the Hohmann transfer time of approximately 6 years (see Chapter 4). The
Hohmann transfer to Saturn requires a AV from Earth parking orbit in excess of
7 km/s, and although this is the minimum possible for a two-impulse maneuver,
it is substantially in excess of that capable of being supplied by any existing upper
stage. However, the initial AV required to effect a Venus flyby for Cassini was

i only about half this value, after which subsequent encounters were used to boost 
the orbital energy to that required for the outer-planet trip. The multiple-gravity- 
I assist Cassini mission design thus provided a reasonable flight time while 
remaining within the constraints of the available launch vehicle technology. 
Spacecraft visiting the outer planets cannot depend on solar energy for 
electrical power and heating. Use of solar concentrators can extend the range of 
useful solar power possibly as far as Jupiter, but at the cost of considerable 
complexity. The spacecraft that have flown to these regions, as well as those that 
are planned, depend on power obtained by radioactive decay processes. These 
power units, generally called radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), 
use banks of thermoelectric elements to convert the heat generated by 
radioisotope decay into electric power. The sun is no longer a significant factor at 
this point, and all heat required, for example to keep propellants warm, must be 
supplied by electricity or by using the waste heat of the RTGs. On the positive 
side, surfaces designed to radiate heat at modest temperatures, such as electronics 
boxes, can do so in full sunlight, a convenience for the configuration designer that 
is not available inside the orbit of Mars.

The main belt asteroids are sufficiently distant from the sun that they are 
relatively difficult to reach in terms of energy and flight he. Except for the inner 
regions of the belt, solar power is not really practical. For example, an asteroid at

factor of 8.84 compared with that available at the orbit of Earth. RTGs or, in the 
future, possibly full-scale nuclear reactors will be required.

Comets and asteroids, the small bodies of the solar system, were largely
ignored during the early phases of space exploration, although various mission
possibilities were discussed and, as noted, some have come into fruition.
Although most of the scientific interest (and public attention) focuses on comets,
the asteroids present a subject of great interest also. Not only are they of scientific

few of these Earth-approaching asteroids are known as yet, but analysis indicates
36 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
that there should be large numbers of them. Discovery of new asteroids in this 
class is a relatively frequent event. 
Comets generally occupy higbly eccentric orbits, often with very high 
inclination. Some orbits are so eccentric that it is debatable whether they are in fact 
closed orbits at all. In any case, the orbital periods, if the term is meaningful, are very 
large for such comets. Some comets are in much shorter but still highly eccentric 
orbits; the comet Halley, with a period of 76 years, lies at the upper end of this short- 
period class. The shortest known cometary period is that of Encke, at 3.6 years. 
As stated, most comets are in high-inclination orbits, of which Halley's Comet is 
an extreme example, with an inclination of 160 deg. This means that it circles the sun 
in a retrograde direction at an angle of 20 deg to the ecliptic. With few exceptions, 
comet rendezvous (as distinct from intercept) is not possible using chemical 
propulsion. High-energy solar or nuclear powepxl electric propulsion or solar sailing 
can, with reasanable technological advances, allow rendezvous with most comets. 
As this goes to press, the first cometary exploration mission will be the NASA 
Deep Impact probe, scheduled for an early 2004 launch and later intercept with 
Comet Tempe1 1. 
2.5.4 Orbit Design Considerations 
Although we will consider this topic in more detail in Chapter 4, the field of 
orbit and trajectory design for planetary missions is so rich in variety that an 
overview is appropriate at this point. Transfer trajectories to other planets are 
determined at the most basic level by the phasing of the launch and target planets. 
Simply put, both must be in the proper place at the proper time. This is not nearly 
as constraining as it may sound, particularly with modem computational mission 
design techniques. A wide variety of transfer orbits can usually be found to match 
launch dates that are proper from other points of view, such as the availability of 
hardware and funding. 
The conventional transfer trajectory is a solar orbit designed around an inferior 
conjunction (for inner planets) or opposition (for outer planets). Such orbits, 
although they do not possess the flexibility described earlier, are often the best 
compromise of minimum energy and minimum flight time. These orbits typically 
travel an arc of somewhat less than 180 deg (type 1 transfer) or somewhat more 
than 180 deg (type 2 transfer) about the sun. A special case here is the classical 
two-impulse, minimum-energy Hohmann transfer. This trajectory is completely 
specified by specifying a 180 deg arc between the launch and target planets that it 
is tangent to both the departure and arrival orbits. However, the Hohmann orbit 
assumes coplanar circular orbits for the two planets, a condition that is in practice 
never met exactly. Because the final trajectory is rather sensitive'to these 
assumptions, true Hohmann transfers are not used. Furthermore, flight times 
using such a transfer would be unreasonably long for any planetary target outside 
the orbit of Mars. Ingenuity in orbit design or added booster power, or both, must . 
be used to obtain acceptable mission durations for flights to the outer planets.

The expenditure of additional launch energy is the obvious approach to 
reducing flight times. This involves placing the apsis of the transfer orbit well 
I beyond the target orbit, thus causing the vehicle to complete its transfer to the 
desired planet much more quickly. In the limit, this section can be made to appear 
as nearly a straight line, but at great energy cost at both departure and arrival. 
A planetary transfer such as this is beyond present technological capabilities. 
The other extreme is to accept longer flight times to obtain minimum energy 
expenditure. In its simplest form, this involves an orbit of 540 deg of arc. The 
vehicle flies to the target orbit (the target is elsewhere), back to the launch orbit 
(the launch planet is elsewhere), then finally back to the target. Such an evolution 
sometimes saves energy relative to shorter trajectories through more favorable 
nodal positioning or other factors. This gain must be traded off against other 
factors such as increased operations cost, budgeting of onboard consumables, 
failure risk, and utility of the science data. 
A more complicated but more commonly used option involves the application 
of a velocity change sometime during the solar orbit phase. This can be done 
propulsively or by a suitable target flyby (increasingly the method of choice) of a 
third body, or by some combination of these. The propulsive AV approach is 
simplest. A substantial impulse applied in deep space may, for example, allow an 
efficient change in orbital plane, thus reducing total energy requirements. A more 
exacting technique is to fly past another body in route and use the swingby to gain 
or lose energy (relative to the sun, not the planet providing the gravity assist). 
Mariner 10 used this technique at Venus to reach Mercury, and Pioneer 1 1 and the 
two Voyagers used it at Jupiter to reach Saturn. Voyager 2, of course, used a 
second gravity assist at Saturn to continue to Uranus. The Venus and Earth 
swingbys mentioned in conjunction with the Galileo mission supply both plane 
change and added energy. The Jupiter satellite flybys perform a similar function 
in Jupiter orbit. 
The gravity-assist technique, now well established, was first used with 
Mariner 10. In fact, the only means of reaching Mercury with current launch 
vehicles and a mass suffi~ient to allow injection into Mercury orbit with chemical 
propulsion is via a multirevolution transfer orbit with one or more Venus flybys to 
reduce the energy of the orbit at Mercury amval to manageable levels. Of course, 
in planetary exploration, the additional time spent in doing swingbys is hardly a 
penalty; we have not yet reached the point where so much is known about any 
planet that an additional swingby is considered a waste of time. 
As noted, this is now a mature technique. It was exploited to the fullest during 
the Galileo mission to Jupiter, where repeated pumping of the spacecraft orbit 
through gravity assists from its moons was used to raise and lower the orbit and 
change its inclination. The orbit in fact was never the same twice. These "tours" 
allowed the maximum data collection about the planet and its satellites, while 
permitting a thorough survey of the magnetic field and the space environment. 
The final class of methods whereby difficult targets can be reached without 
excessive propulsive capability involves the use of the launch planet itself for

in planetary exploration, the additional time spent in doing swingbys is hardly a

gravity assist maneuvers. The spacecraft is initially launched into a solar orbit 
synchronized to intercept the launch planet again, usually after one full 
revolution of the planet, unless a midcourse AV is applied. The subsequent flyby 
can be used to change the energy or inclination of the transfer orbit, or both. It is 
also possible to apply a propulsive AV during the flyby. Such mission profiles 
have been frequently studied as options for outer planetary missions, and, as 
discussed, were applied to both Galileo and Cassini. 
The orbits into which spacecraft are placed about a target planet are driven by 
substantially the same criteria as for spacecraft in Earth orbit. For instance, the 
Viking orbiters were placed in highly elliptic 24.6-h orbits (a "sol," or one 
Martian day) so that they would arrive over their respective lander vehicles at the 
same time each day to relay data. Mars geoscience mappers may utilize polar 
sun-synchronous orbits like those used by similar vehicles at Earth. A possibility 
for planetary orbiters is that, rather than beiig synchronized with anything at the 
target planet, they can be in an orbit with a period synchronized with Earth. For 
example, the spacecraft might be at periapsis each time a particular tracking 
station was in view. 
Low-thrust planetary trajectories are required for electric and solar sail 
propulsion and are quite different from the ballistic trajectory designs described 
thus far, because the thrust is applied constantly over very long arcs in 
the trajectory. Such trajectories also may make use of planetary flybys to conserve 
energy or reduce mission duration. The most notable difference is at the departure 
and target planets. At the former, unless boosted by chemical rockets to 
escape velocity, the vehicle must spend months spiraling out of the planetary 
gravity field. In some cases this phase may be as long as the interplanetary flight 
time. At the target, the reverse occurs. 
This situation results from the very low thrust-to-mass ratio of such systems. 
In one instance where solar-electric propulsion was proposed for a Mars sample 
return mission, it was found that the solar-electric vehicle did not have time to 
spiral down to an altitude compatible with the use of a chemically-propelled 
sample carrier from the surface. To return to Earth, it had to begin spiraling back 
out before reaching a reasonable rendezvous altitude. Higher thrust-to-mass 
ratios such as those offered by nuclear-electric propulsion or advanced solar sails 
would overcome this problem. Solar-electric propulsion and less capable solar 
sails are most satisfactory for missions not encountering a deep gravity well. 
Comet and asteroid missions and close-approach or out-of-ecliptic solar missions 
are examples.

be very prosaic. In many areas, there is a well-established way to do things, and I designs evolve only within narrow limits. 
This is not true of missions that are very advanced by today's standards. Such 
missions include the development of large structures for solar power satellites or 
, antenna farms, construction of permanent space stations, lunar and asteroid 
1 mining, propellant manufacture on other planets, and many other activities that 
cannot be accurately envisioned at present. For these advanced concepts, the 
I designer's imagination is still free to roam, limited only by established principles 
of sound engineering practice. In this section, we examine some of the possibilities 
for future space missions that have been advocated in recent years, with attention 
given to the mission and spacecraft design requirements they will pose. 
2.6.1 Large Space Structures 
Many of the advanced mission concepts that have surfaced have in common 
the element of requiring the deployment in Earth orbit of what are, by present 
standards, extremely large structures. Examples of such systems include solar 
power satellites, first conceived by Dr. Peter Glaser, and the large, centralized 
antenna platforms alluded to previously in connection with communications 
satellites. These structures will have one outstanding difference from Earth-based 
structures of similar size, and that is their extremely low mass. If erected in a 0-g 
environment, these platforms need not cope with the stresses of Earth's 
gravitational field, and need only be designed to offer sufficient rigidity for the 
task at hand. This fact alone wilI offer many opportunities for both success and 
failure in exploiting the capabilities of large space platforms. 
Orbit selection for large space structures will in principle be guided by much 
the same criteria as for smaller systems, that is, the orbit design will be defined by 
the mission to be performed. However, the potentially extreme size bf the 
vehicles involved will offer some new criteria for optimization. Systems of large 
area and low mass will be highly susceptible to aerodynamic drag, and will 
generally need to be in very high orbits to avoid requirements for excessive drag 
compensation propulsion. For such platforms, solar pressure can become the 
dominant orbital perturbation. Similarly, systems with very large mass will tend 
toward low orbits to minimize the expense of construction with materials femed 
up from Earth. When the time comes that many large platforms are deployed 
in high Earth orbit, it is likely that the use of lunar and asteroid materials 
for construction will become economically attractive. In terms of energy 
requirements, the moon is closer to geosynchronous orbit than is the surface of 
the Earth. The consequences of this fact have been explored in a number of 
studies.

failure in exploiting the capabilities of large space platforms.

Orbit selection for large space structures will in principle be guided by much
the same criteria as for smaller systems, that is, the orbit design will be defined by
the mission to be performed. However, the potentially extreme size of the
vehicles involved will offer some new criteria for optimization. Systems of large
area and low mass will be highly susceptible to aerodynamic drag, and will
generally need to be in very high orbits to avoid requirements for excessive drag
compensation propulsion. For such platforms, solar pressure can become the
dominant orbital perturbation. Similarly, systems with very large mass will tend
toward low orbits to minimize the expense of construction with materials ferried
up from Earth. When the time comes that many large platforms are deployed
in high Earth orbit, it is likely that the use of lunar and asteroid materials
for construction will become economically attractive. In terms of energy
requirements, the moon is closer to geosynchronous orbit than is the surface of
the Earth. The consequences of this fact have been explored in a number of
Studies.

Other characteristics of expected large space systems have also received 
considerable analytical attention. As mentioned, structures such as very large 
antennas or solar power satellites will have quite low mass for their size by Earth 
standards. Yet these structures, particularly antennas, require quite precise shape 
control to achieve their basic goals. On Earth, this requirement is basically met 
through the use of sufficient mass to provide the needed rigidity, a requirement 
that is not usually inconsistent with that for sufficient strength to allow the 
structure to support itself in Earth's gravitational field. As mentioned, in a 0g 
environment this will not be the case. Very large structures of low mass will 
have very low characteristic frequencies of vibration, and quite possibly very 
Little damping at these frequencies. Thus, it has been expected that some form of 
active shape control will often be required, and much effort has been expended in 
defining the nature of such control schemes. 
Translation control requires similar care. For example, it will hardly be 
sufficient to attach a single engine to themiddle of a solar power satellite some tens 
of squarekilometers in size and ignite it. Not much of the structure will remain 
with the engine. It may be expected that electric or other low-thrust propulsion 
systems will come into their own with the development of large space platforms.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
The only presently viable alternative to solar power for a permanent station is 
a nuclear system, and here we are generally talking about nuclear reactors rather 
than the RTGs discussed earlier. RTGs do not have a sufficiently high power-to- 
weight ratio to be acceptable when high power levels are required. Chemical 
energy systems such as fuel cells are not practical for permanent orbital stations 
when the reactants must be brought from Earth. This conclusion could change in 
the short term if a practical means of recovering unused launch vehicle propellant 
could be devised, and in the long term if use of extraterrestrial materials becomes 
common. In the meantime, nuclear power offers the only compact, long-lived 
source of power in the kilowatt to megawatt range. 
Nuclear power also raises substantial problems. The high-temperature reactor 
and thermal radiators, the high level of ionizing radiation, and the difficulty of 
systems integration caused by these factors present substantial engineering 
problems. No less serious is public concern with possible envuonmental effects 
due to the uncontrolled reentry of a reactor. This first happened with the Russian 
Cosmos 954 vehicle, which fortunately crashed in a remote region of Canada. 
The cleanup operations involved were not trivial. 
Of similar importance is the environmental control system of the station. The 
more independent of resupply from the ground it can be, the more economical the 
permanent operation of the station will become. The ultimate goal of a fully 
recycled, closed environmental system will be long in coming, but even a 
reasonably high percentage of water and oxygen recycling wil3 be of significant 
help. The possibility of an ecological approach to oxygen recycling may allow 
production of fresh fruits, vegetables, and decorative plants. .The latter may be of 
only small significance to the resupply problem, but may be quite important for 
crew morale. Similar concern with environmental issues has gone into the design 
of U.S. Navy nuclear submarines, which spend long periods submerged. 
As the construction and operation of the ISS continues, it will be of interest to 
examine these and other methods by which crew morale is maintained. That the 
issue is not trivial is shown by the records of more than one U.S. space flight, 
where both flight crew boredom and overwork have on occasion led to some 
acrimonious exchanges with ground control. With the greater visibility now 
available into the Russian manned space program, similar cases have emerged, 
again reaffirming the importance of crew morale to mission success.

2.6.3 Space Colonies

Long-term-habitability space stations can be expected to provide the initial
basis for the design of space colonies or colonies on other planets or asteroids.
The borderline between space stations, or research or work stations on other
planets, and true colonies is necessarily somewhat blurred, but the use of the term
“colonies” is generally taken to imply self-sufficient habitats with residents of all
types who expect to live out their lives in the colony. Trade with Earth is
presumed, as a colony with no economic basis for its existence probably will not

have one. On the other hand, it seems reasonable that- "research stations" or 
"lunar mining bases" could grow into colonies, given the right circumstances. 
The late Gerard K. O'Neill and his co-worker5 have been the most ardent 
recent proponents of the utility and viability of space colonies. In the O'Neill 
concept, the colonies will have as their economic justification the construction of 
solar power satellites for Earth, using raw materials derived from lunar or 
asteroid bases. It would seem that other uses for such habitats could be found as 
well; as mentioned previously, in the very long run it may be that eventually 
much of Earth's heavy manufacturing is relocated to sites in space to take 
advantage of the availability of energy and raw materials. In any case, O'Neill 
envisioned truly extensive space habitats, tens of kilometers in dimension, 
featuring literally all of the comforts of home, including grass, trees, and houses 
in picturesque rural settings. 
Whether or not these developments ever come to pass (and the authors do not 
wish to say that they cannot; well-reasoned economic arguments for developing 
such colonies have been advanced), such concepts would seem to be the near- 
ultimate in spacecraft design. In every way, construction of such habitats would 
pose problems that, without doubt, are presently unforeseen. The engineering 
of space colonies and colonies on other planets will demand the use of every 
specialty known on Earth today, from agriculture to zoology, and these 
specialists will have to learn to transfer their knowledge to extraterrestrial 
conditions. The history of the efforts of Western Europeans simply to colonize 
other regions of Earth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries suggests both 
that it will be done and that it will not be done easily. 
2.6.4 Use of Lunar and Asteroid Materjals 
Even our limited exploration of the moon has indicated considerable potential 
for supplying useful material. We have not in our preliminary forays observed 
rich beds of ore such as can be found on Earth. Some geologists have speculated 
that such concentrations may not exist on the moon. and it certainly seems 
reasonable to suppose that they do not exist near the surface, which is a regolith 
composed of material pulverized and dispersed in countless meteoric impacts. 
However, the common material of the lunar crust offers a variety of useful 
materials, most prominently aluminum, oxygen, and titanium, which is 
surprisingly in relatively large supply in the lunar samples so far seen. A more 
useful metal for space manufacturing would be hard to find. The metals exist as 
oxides or in more complex compounds. A variety of processes have been 
suggested for the production of useful metals and oxygen; which material is the 
product and which is the by-product depends on the prejudices of the reader. 
Because of the cost of refining the material on the moon and transporting it to 
Earth, it is improbable that such materials would be economically competitive 
with materials produced here on Earth. An exception would be special alloys 
made in Og or other substances uniquely depending on the space environment for

for supplying useful material. We have not in our preliminary forays observed
rich beds of ore such as can be found on Earth. Some geologists have speculated
that such concentrations may not exist on the moon, and it certainly seems

Earth, it is improbable that such materials would be economically competitive
with materials produced here on Earth. An exception would be special alloys
made in Og or other substances uniquely depending on the space environment for

44 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
their creation. However, extraterrestrial materials may well compete with 
materials femed up from Earth for construction in orbit or on the moon itself. 
This is the primary justification for lunar and asteroid mining, and it seems so 
strong that it must eventually come to pass, when the necessary base of capital 
equipment exists in space. 
It may well be that products (as opposed to raw materials) manufactured in 
space will compete successfully with comparable products manufactured on 
Earth. Early candidates will be goods whose price is high for the mass they 
possess and whose manufacture isenergy intensive, hampered by gravity and/or 
atmospheric contaminants, and highly suitable for automated production. Semi- 
conductors and integrated circuits, pharmaceuticals, and certain alloys have been 
identified in this category. Other activities may follow; one can imagine good 
and sacient reasons for locating genetic engineering research and develop- 
ment efforts in an isolated space-based laboratory. 
With the accumulation in orbit of sufficient capital equipment to allow large- 
scale use of lunar or other extraterrestrial materials, and the development of 
effective solar energy collection methods, the growth of heavy manufacturing 
must follow. As noted, the surface of the moon is much closer to either GEO or 
LEO in terms of energy expenditure than is the surface of Earth. Any really large 
projects will probably be more economical with lunar material, even considering 
the necessary investment in lunar mining bases. Further, some resources are more 
readily used than others; even relatively modest trahfic from LEO to GEO, the 
moon, or deep space will probably benefit from oxygen generated on the moon 
and sent down to Earth orbit. 
The probability, long theorized and now supported by observational data from 
the Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions, that water ice is trapped in 
permanently dark, very cold regions near the lunar poles is of great interest. Water is 
not only vital for life-support functions (though with closed systems, humans 
generate water as a by-product of other activities, thus reducing the life-support 
problem to that of food alone), but it is also useful in a variety of chemical processes, 
and especially in the production of hydrogen. Thus far it appears that no econ- 
omically viable supply of hydrogen exists on the moon except in these ice reser- 
voirs. Hydrogen is useful as a propellant and in a variety of chemical reactions. If it 
cannot be obtained on the moon, it will have to be imported from Earth, at least in 
the short term. Although its low mass makes importation of hydrogen at least 
somewhat tolerable, the desirability of finding it on the moon is obvious. 
The use of asteroid materials has equally fascinating potential. Taken as a 
class, asteroids offer an even more interesting spectrum of materials than has so 
far been identified on the moon. The metallic bodies consist mostly of nickel- 
iron, which should be a reasonably good structural material as found and would 
be refinable into a variety of others. The carbonaceous chondrite types seem to 
contain water, carbon, and organic materials as well as silicates. These would 
have the obvious advantage of being water and hydrogen sources; indeed, some i 
models of the Martian climate have postulated that such asteroids are the source I

their creation. However, extraterrestrial materials may well compete with
materials ferried up from Earth for construction in orbit or on the moon itself.
This is the primary justification for lunar and asteroid mining, and it seems so
strong that it must eventually come to pass, when the necessary base of capital
equipment exists in space.

It may well be that products (as opposed to raw materials) manufactured in

and sent down to Earth orbit.

The probability, long theorized and now supported by observational data from

‘the Clementine and Lunar Prospector missions, that water ice is trapped in
permanently dark, very cold regions near the lunar poles is of great interest. Water is
not only vital for life-support functions (though with closed systems, humans

contain water, carbon, and organic materials as well as silicates. These would
have the obvious advantage of being water and hydrogen sources; indeed, some
models of the Martian climate have postulated that such asteroids are the source

MISSION DESIGN 45 
of what Martian water exists. The most common, and probably least useful,, 
asteroids are composed mostly of silicate materials; essentially, they are 
indistinguishable from common inorganic Earth dirt. 
Although, as mentioned, most asteroids lie in the main belt between Mars and 
Jupiter, a modest number lie in orbits near to or crossing that of Earth. Some of 
these are energetically quite easy to reach, but with the problem that the low 
round-trip energy requirement is achieved at the cost of travel times on the order 
of three years or more. Launch windows are restricted to a few weeks every two 
or three years. Thus, although it is true that some asteroids are easier to reach than 
the surface of the moon, this must be balanced against the lunar round-trip time of 
a few days, together with the ability to make the trip nearly any time. Thus, 
although asteroid materials of either the Earth-approaching or main-belt variety 
will probably become of substantial importance eventually, it seems likely that 
lunar materials will do so first, if only because of convenience. 
2.6.5 Propellant Manufacturing 
Propellant manufacturing is a special case involving the use of resources 
naturally occurring on the various bodies of the solar system. It was mentioned in 
passing under the more general subject of lunar and asteroid resources, but it is by 
no means restricted to these bodies. In the inner solar system, Mars seems to offer 
the most promise for application of in situ propellant manufacturing technology. 
As noted previously, for the manufacture of a full set of propellants (both fuel 
and oxidizer), water is both necessary and sufficient. However, carbon, which is 
also in short supply on the moon, is also important. The atmosphere of Mars 
provides carbon dioxide in abundance, and water is known to exist in the polar ice 
caps and most probably in the form of permafrost over much of the planet. 
Propellant manufacturing has been studied both for unmanned sample return 
missions and for manned missions. The advantages are comparable to those that 
accrue by refueling airliners at each end of a flight, rather than designing them to 
cay fuel for a coast-to-coast round-trip. 
Because of the difficulty of mining permafrost or low-temperature ice, it has 
been suggested that the first propellant manufacturing effort might use the 
atmosphere exclusively. Carbon dioxide can be taken in by compression and 
then, in a cell using thermal decomposition and an oxygen permeable membrane, 
split into carbon monoxide and oxygen. The oxygen can then be liquified and 
burned with a fuel brought from Earth. Methane is the preferred choice, because 
it has high performance, a high oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (to minimize the mass 
brought from Earth), and is a good refrigerant. The latter quality contributes to 
the process of liquifying the oxygen and keeping both propellants liquid until 
enough oxidizer is accumulated and the launch window opens. 
It should be noted that the combination of carbon monoxide and oxygen is a 
potential propellant combination. The theoretical performance is modest at best, 
indicating a delivered specific impulse of 260 s at Mars conditions. Tests in 1991

of what Martian water exists. The most common, and probably least useful, +
asteroids are composed mostly of silicate materials; essentially, they are
indistinguishable from common inorganic Earth dirt.

Although, as mentioned, most asteroids lie in the main belt between Mars and
Jupiter, a modest number lie in orbits near to or crossing that of Earth. Some of
these are energetically quite easy to reach, but with the problem that the low
round-trip energy requirement is achieved at the cost of travel times on the order
of three years or more. Launch windows are restricted to a few weeks every two
or three years. Thus, although it is true that some asteroids are easier to reach than
the surface of the moon, this must be balanced against the lunar round-trip time of
a few days, together with the ability to make the trip nearly any time. Thus,
although asteroid materials of either the Earth-approaching or main-belt variety
will probably become of substantial importance eventually, it seems likely that
lunar materials will do so first, if only because of convenience.

2.6.5 Propellant Manufacturing

Propellant manufacturing is a special case involving the use of resources
naturally occurring on the various bodies of the solar system. It was mentioned in
passing under the more general subject of lunar and asteroid resources, but it is by
no means restricted to these bodies. In the inner solar system, Mars seems to offer
the most promise for application of in situ propellant manufacturing technology.

As noted previously, for the manufacture of a full set of propellants (both fuel
and oxidizer), water is both necessary and sufficient. However, carbon, which is
also in short supply on the moon, is also important. The atmosphere of Mars
provides carbon dioxide in abundance, and water is known to exist in the polar ice
caps and most probably in the form of permafrost over much of the planet.
Propellant manufacturing has been studied both for unmanned sample return
missions and for manned missions. The advantages are comparable to those that
accrue by refueling airliners at each end of a flight, rather than designing them to
carry fuel for a coast-to-coast round-trip.

Because of the difficulty of mining permafrost or low-temperature ice, it has
been suggested that the first propellant manufacturing effort might use the
atmosphere exclusively. Carbon dioxide can be taken in by compression and
then, in a cell using thermal decomposition and an oxygen permeable membrane,
split into carbon monoxide and oxygen. The oxygen can then be liquified and
burned with a fuel brought from Earth. Methane is the preferred choice, because
it has high performance, a high oxidizer-to-fuel ratio (to minimize the mass
brought from Earth), and is a good refrigerant. The latter quality contributes to
the process of liquifying the oxygen and keeping both propellants liquid until
enough oxidizer is accumulated and the launch window opens.

It should be noted that the combination of carbon monoxide and oxygen is a
potential propellant combination. The theoretical performance is modest at best,
indicating a delivered specific impulse of 260 s at Mars conditions. Tests in 1991

46 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
have co&ed the theoretical predictions. This performance might be adequate 
for short-range vehicles supporting a manned base on Mars, however, and would 
certainly be convenient. It is even suitable for orbital vehicles although propellant 
mass is large. A final advantage is that, because the exhaust product is carbon 
dioxide, there would be no net effect on the Martian atmosphere. 
Making use of Martian water broadens the potential options considerably. 
Besides the obvious hydrogen/oxygen combination, use of both water and 
carbon dioxide allows the synthesis of other chemicals such as methane. Methane 
is an excellent fuel and is more easily storable than hydrogen. Methanol can also - 
be created, either as a fuel or for use in other chemical processes. Another 
possible option is to bring hydrogen from Earth. The required mass is relatively 
small, although the bulkiness resulting from it is low density and the difficulty of 
long-term storage may cause problems. From this brief glimpse, it can be seen 
that water and carbon or carbon dioxide form the basis for propellant manu- 
facnuing as well as other chemical processes. 
Because carbonaceous chondrites presumably contain both water and carbon 
compounds, it is probable that these bodies have potential for various types of 
chemical synthesis as well. The satellites of the outer planets contain consi- 
derable water; indeed, some are mostly water. Whether useful carbon-containing 
compounds are available is less certain, but at least the hydrogen/oxygen 
propellant combination will be available. 
In all propellant manufacturing processes, the key is power. Regardless of the 
availability of raw materials, substantial energy is required to decompose the 
water or carbon dioxide. Compression and liquefaction of the products also 
require energy. The possible sources of energy are solar arrays, nuclear systems 
using radioisotopic decay, and critical assemblies (reactors). The use of solar 
energy is only practical in the inner solar system, and then probably only for 
small production rates. 
2.6.6 Nuclear Waste Disposal [: I 
Disposal of long-lived highly radioactive waste in space has been discussed 
for many years. The attraction is obvious; it is the one disposal mode that, 
properly implemented, has no chance of contaminating the biosphere of Earth 
because of leakage or natural disaster. 
The least demanding technique would be to place the waste into an orbit of 
Earth that is at sufiicient altitude that no conceivable combination of atmospheric 
drag or orbital perturbations would cause the orbit to decay. Even though this is 
workable, it is not considered satisfactory by some, because the material is still i 
within the Earth's sphere of influence and thus might somehow come down. 
A more practical objection is that, as use of near-Earth space increases, it might 1

would be high as well, because the material would need to be soft landed to avoid 
scattering on impact.

desirable arena for disposal, preferably in an orbit far from that of Earth. One 
approach would steal a page from the Mariner 10 mission. For a total energy 
expenditure less than that for a landing on the moon, the material could be sent on a 
trajectory to fly by Venus. This could move the perihelion of the orbit to a point 
between Venus and Mercury. A relatively minor velocity change at the perihelion of 
the orbit would then lower aphelion inside the orbit of Venus. The package would 
then be in a stable, predictable orbit that would never again come close to Earth. 
The major problem with the space disposal of nuclear waste is the emotional 
fear of a launch failure spreading the material widely over the surface of the Earth. 
Although a number of concepts could be applied to minimize the risk, it seems 
doubtful that this concept will become acceptable to the public in the near future.

3.1. Introduction

In the broadest sense, the spacecraft environment includes everything to which
the spacecraft is exposed from its beginning as raw material to the end of its
operating life. This includes the fabrication, assembly, and test environment on
Earth, transportation from point to point on Earth, launch, the space environment,
and possibly an atmospheric entry and continued operation in a destination
environment at another planet.

Both natural and man-made environments are imposed upon the spacecraft.
Contrary to the popular view, the rigors of launch and the space environment
itself are often not the greatest hazards to the spacecraft. The spacecraft is
designed to be launched and to fly in space. If the design is properly done, these
environments are not a problem; a spacecraft sometimes seems at greatest risk
on Earth in the hands of its creators. Spacecraft are often designed with only
the briefest consideration of the need for ground handling, transportation, and
test. As a result, these operations and the compromises and accommodations
necessary to carry them out may in fact represent a more substantial risk than
anything that happens in a normal flight.

However, the preceding comments imply that the spacecraft is designed for
proper functioning in flight. To do this it is necessary to know the range of
conditions encountered. This includes not only the flight environment but also the
qualification test conditions that must be met to demonstrate that the design is
correct. To provide confidence that the design will be robust in the face of
unexpectedly severe conditions, these tests are typically more stringent than the
expected actual environment. In some cases, especially where the rigorous safety
standards applied to manned flight are concerned, even the origin of the materials
used and the details of the processes by which they are fashioned into spacecraft
components may be important to the process of qualifying the spacecraft for
flight. Many spacecraft have been lost due to lack of full understanding of the
environment.

In this chapter we will discuss the Earth, launch, and space environments, but
in somewhat different terms. The launch and flight environments are usually
quite well defined for specific launch vehicles and missions. These conditions,
and the qualification test levels that are derived from them, will be treated as the
actual environment for which the vehicle must be designed. The Earth

49

environment is assumed to be controllable, within limits, to meet the 
requirements of a spacecraft, subsystem, or component. Also, the variety of 
Earth environments, modes of handling and transport, etc., is so great as to 
preclude a detailed quantitative discussion of them in this volume. Accordingly, 
the discussion will be of a more general nature when addressing Earth 
environments. 
3.2 Earth Environment 
Throughout its tenure on Earth, the spacecraft and its components are 
subjected to a variety of potentially degrading environments. The atmosphere 
itself is a primary source of problems. Containing both water and oxygen, the 
Earth's atmosphere is quite corrosive to a variety of materials, including many of 
those used in spacecraft, such as lightweight structural alloys. Corrosion 
of structural materials can cause stress concentration or embrittlement, 
possibly leading to failure during launch. Corrosion of pins in electrical 
connectors can lead to excessive circuit resistance and thus unsatisfactory 
performance. Because of these effects it is desirable to control the relative 
humidity and in extreme cases to exclude oxygen and moisture entirely by use of 
a dry nitrogen or helium purge. This is normally required only for individual 
subsystems such as scientific instruments; in general, the spacecraft can tolerate 
exposure to the atmosphere if humidity is not excessive. However, too low 
a relative humidity is also poor practice both from consideration of worker 
comfort and from a desire to minimize buildup of static electiic charge (discussed 
later in more detail). A relative humidity in the 40-50% range is normally a 
good compromise. 
Another environmental problem arising from the atmosphere is airborne 
particulate contamination, or dust. Even in a normally clean environment, dust 
will accumulate on horizontal surfaces fairly rapidly. For some spacecraft a 
burden of dust particles is not significant; however, in many cases it can have 
undesirable effects. Dust can cause wear in delicate mechanisms and can plug 
small orifices. Dislodged dust particles drifting in space, illuminated by the sun, 
can look very much like stars to a star sensor or tracker on the spacecraft. This 
confusion can and has caused loss of attitude reference accuracy in operating 
spacecraft. Finally, dust typically hosts a population of viruses and bacteria that 
are unacceptable on a spacecraft destined for a visit to a planet on which Earth 
life might be viable. 
Because of the concern for preventing dust contamination, spacecraft and their 
subsystems are normally assembled and tested in "clean room" environments. 
Details of how such environments are obtained are not of primary interest here. 
In general, clean rooms (see Fig. 3.1) require careful control of surfaces in 
the room to minimize dust generation and supply of conditioned air through 
high-efficiency particulate filters. In more stringent cases a unidirectional flow of

air is maintained, entering at the ceiling or one wall and exiting at the opposite 
surface. 
The most advanced type of facility is the so-called laminar flow clean room, in 
which the air is introduced uniformly over the entire surface of a porous ceiling or 
wall and withdrawn uniformly through the opposing surface or allowed to exit as 
from a tunnel. Actual larninarity of flow is unlikely, especially in a large facility, 
but the very uniform flow of clean air does minimize particulate collection. Small 
component work is done at "clean benches," workbench type facilities where the 
clean environment is essentially restricted to the benchtop. The airflow exhausts 
toward the worker seated at the bench, as in Fig. 3.2. 
Clean room workers usually must wear special clothing that minimizes 
particulate production from regular clothing or the body. Clean mom garb 
typically involves gloves, smocks or "bunnysuits," head covering, and foot 
covering. All this must be lint free. In some cases masks are required as well. 
Because of the constant airffow and blower noise and the restrictive nature of the 
clothing, clean room work is often tiring even though it does not involve heavy 
labor. 
Clean facilities are given class ratings such as Class 100,000, Class 1000, or 
Class 100 facilities. The rating refers to the particulate content of a cubic foot of 
air for particles between specified upper and lower size limits; thus, lower 
numbers represent cleaner facilities. Class 100 is the cleanest rating normally 
discussed and is extremely difficult to maintain in a large facility, especially when

large spacecraft and one in which several persons might be working. A Class

damaged by a discharge such as might occur from a technician's fingertip. To

hardware. This is usually done using conductive flooring and conductive shoes or

SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT 53 
ankle ground straps. For especially sensitive cases a ground sthp on the wrist 
may be worn. 
Because low relative humidity contributes to static charge accumulation, it is 
desirable that air in spacecraft work areas not be excessively dry. The compromise 
with the corrosion problem discussed earlier usually results in a chosen 
relative humidity of about 40-50%. Plastic cases and covers and tightly 
woven synthetic garments, all favored for low particle generation, tend to build 
up very high voltages unless treated to prevent it. Special conductive plastics 
are available, as are fabric treatment techniques. However, the conductive 
character can be lost over time, and so clean room articles must be constantly 
monitored. 
In theory, with all electronic components mounted and all electrical con- 
nections mated, the spacecraft should be safe from static discharge. In practice, 
however, the precautions discussed earlier are generally observed by anyone 
touching or handling the spacecraft. The primary risk arises from contact with the 
circuit that occurs when pins are touched in an unmated connector. Unnecessary 
contact of this type should be avoided. 
Transporting the spacecraft from point to point on Earth may well subject it to 
more damaging vibration and shock than experienced during launch. Road 
vibration and shock during ground transportation can be higher than those 
imposed by launch and the duration is much longer, usually hours or days 
compared with the few minutes required for launch. For short trips, as from 
building to building within a facility, the problem can best be handled by moving 
the spacecraft very slowly over a carefully selected and/or prepared route. For 
longer trips where higher speed is required, special vehicles employing air 
cushion suspension are usually required. These vehicles may be specially built 
for the purpose, or may simply be commercial vans specialized for delicate cargo. 
Truck or trailer suspensions can deteriorate in service, and it is usually desirable 
to subject them to instrumented road tests before committing expensive and 
delicate hardware to a long haul. 
Hying is generally preferable to ground transportation for long trips. Jets are 
preferred to propeller-driven aircraft because of the lower vibration and acoustic 
levels. High g loads can occur at landing or as a result of turbulence, and the 
spacecraft must be properly supported to provide protection. The depressuriza- 
tion/pressurization cycle involved in climb and descent can also be a problem. 
For example, a closed vessel, although designed for several atmospheres of 
internal pressure, can easily collapse if it bleeds down to an internal pressure 
equivalent to several thousand feet altitude during flight and then is quickly 
returned to sea level. This is particularly a problem when transporting propulsion 
stages having large tanks with relatively thin walls. 
When deciding between fight or ground transportation, it should be recalled 
that it will generally be necessary to transport the spacecraft by road to the 
airport, load it on the plane, and then reverse the procedure at the other end. For 
trips of moderate length, a decision should be made as to whether flying, with all

ankle ground straps. For especially sensitive cases a ground strap on the wrist
may be worn.

Because low relative humidity contributes to static charge accumulation, it is
desirable that air in spacecraft work areas not be excessively dry. The compromise
with the corrosion problem discussed earlier usually results in a chosen
relative humidity of about 40-50%. Plastic cases and covers and tightly
woven synthetic garments, all favored for low particle generation, tend to build
up very high voltages unless treated to prevent it. Special conductive plastics
are available, as are fabric treatment techniques. However, the conductive
character can be lost over time, and so clean room articles must be constantly
monitored.

In theory, with all electronic components mounted and all electrical con-
nections mated, the spacecraft should be safe from static discharge. In practice,
however, the precautions discussed earlier are generally observed by anyone
touching or handling the spacecraft. The primary risk arises from contact with the
circuit that occurs when pins are touched in an unmated connector. Unnecessary
contact of this type should be avoided.

Transporting the spacecraft from point to point on Earth may well subject it to
more damaging vibration and shock than experienced during launch. Road
vibration and shock during ground transportation can be higher than those
imposed by launch and the duration is much longer, usually hours or days
compared with the few minutes required for launch. For short trips, as from
building to building within a facility, the problem can best be handled by moving
the spacecraft very slowly over a carefully selected and/or prepared route. For
longer trips where higher speed is required, special vehicles employing air
cushion suspension are usually required. These vehicles may be specially built
for the purpose, or may simply be commercial vans specialized for delicate cargo.
Truck or trailer suspensions can deteriorate in service, and it is usually desirable
to subject them to instrumented road tests before committing expensive and
delicate hardware to a long haul.

Flying is generally preferable.to ground transportation for long trips. Jets are
preferred to propeller-driven aircraft because of the lower vibration and acoustic
levels. High g loads can occur at landing or as a result of turbulence, and the
spacecraft must be properly supported to provide protection. The depressuriza-
tion/pressurization cycle involved in climb and descent can also be a problem.
For example, a closed vessel, although designed for several atmospheres of
internal pressure, can easily collapse if it bleeds down to an internal pressure
equivalent to several thousand feet altitude during flight and then is quickly
returned to sea level. This is particularly a problem when transporting propulsion
stages having large tanks with relatively thin walls.

When deciding between flight or ground transportation, it should be recalled
that it will generally be necessary to transport the spacecraft by road to the
airport, load it on the plane, and then reverse the procedure at the other end. For
trips of moderate length, a decision should be made as to whether flying, with all
54 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
the additional handling involved, is in fact better than completing the entire trip 
on the ground. 
In all cases, whether transporting the space vehicle by ground or air, it is 
essential that it be properly secured to the carrier vehicle structure. This requires 
careful design of the handling and support equipment. Furthermore, all delicate 
structures that could be damaged by continued vibration should be well secured 
or supported. 
For some very large structures, the only practical means of long-range 
transportation is via water. Barges were used for &e lower stages of the Saturn 5 
launch vehicle and continue to be used to transport the shuttle external tank from 
Michoud, Louisiana, to Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
The cleanliness, humidity, and other environmental constraints discussed 
earlier usually must remain in force during transportation. In many cases, as with 
the shipment by boat of the Hubble Space Telescope from its Sunnyvale, 
California, fabrication site to Cape Canaveral, this can present a significant 
logistical challenge. 
3.3 Launch Environment 
Launch imposes a highly stressful environment on the spacecraft for a 
relatively brief period. During the few minutes of launch, the spacecraft is 
subjected to significant axial loads by the accelerating launch vehicle, as well as 
lateral loads from steering and wind gusts. There will be substantial mechanical 
vibration and severe acoustic energy input. The latter is especially pronounced 
just after liftoff as the rocket engine noise is reflected from the ground. 
Aerodynamic noise also contributes, especially in the vicinity of Mach 1. During 
the initial phase of launch, atmospheric pressure will drop from esosentially sea 
level to space vacuum. Aerodynamic heating of the spacecraft may impose 
thermal loads that drive some aspects of the spacecraft design. This initially 
occurs through heating of the nose fairing during low-altitude ascent, then 
directly by fi-ee molecular heating (see Chapter 6) after fairing jettison. Stage 
shutdown, fairing jettison, and spacecraft separation will each produce shock 
transients. 
To ensure that the spacecraft is delivered to its desired orbit or trajectory in 
condition to carry out the mission, it must be designed for and qualified to the 
expected stress levels, with a margin of safety (see Chapter 8). To facilitate 
preliminary design, launch vehicle user handbooks specify pertinent parameters 
such as acoustic, vibration, and shock levels. For vehicles with a well-established 
flight history, the data are based on actual in-flight measurements. Vehicles in the 
developmental phase provide estimated or calculated data based on modeling and 
comparison with similar vehicles.

directly by free molecular heating (see Chapter 6) after fairing jettison. Stage
shutdown, fairing jettison, and spacecraft separation will each produce shock
transients.

To ensure that the spacecraft is delivered to its desired orbit or trajectory in

establishing initial structural design requirements. Because the spacecraft 
and launch vehicle interact, however, the actual environment will vary 
somewhat from one spacecraft payload to another, and the combination of 
launch vehicle and spacecraft must be analyzed as a coupled system.2 As a 
result, the actual environment anticipated for the spacecraft changes with 
. its maturing design and the resulting changes in' the total system. Because 
this in turn affects the spacecraft design, it is clear that an iterative process is 
required. 
The degree of analytical fidelity required in this process is a function of 
mass margins, fiscai resources, and schedule constraints. For example, structural 
modeling of the Viking Mars OrbiterILander was detailed and thorough 
because mass margins were tight. On the other hand, the Solar Mesosphere 
Explorer, a low-budget Earth orbiter that had a very large launch vehicle 
margin, was subjected to limited analysis. Many structures were made 
from heavy plate or other material that was so overdesigned that it limited 
the need for detailed analysis. When schedule is critical, extra mass may well 
be allocated to the structural design to limit the need for detailed analysis and 
testing. 
Acoustic loads are pervasive within the nose fairing or payload bay, with 
peaks sometimes occumng at certain locations. Vibration spectra are usually 
defined at the base of the attach fitting or adapter. Shock inputs are usually 
defined at the location of the generating device, typically an explosively actuated 
or mechanically released device. 
In many cases the various inputs actually vary somewhat from point to 
point, especially in the case of shock spectra. For convenience in preliminary 
design, this is often represented by a single curve that envelops all the 
individual cases. Examples of this may be seen among the curves presented in 
this chapter. In general, use of such curves will lead to a conservative design 
that, at the cost of some extra mass, is well able to withstand the actual flight 
environment. 
To examine launch vehicle data, we present data drawn from user handbooks 
for some of the various major launch vehicles discussed in Chapter 5. Random 
vibration data are presented as curves of spectral density in g2/~z, essentially a 
measure of energy vs frequency of vibration. 
For the shuttle, data are presented at the main longeron and keel fittings, 
whereas for the expendable vehicles it is at the spacecraft attachment plane. 
The first two curves for the shuttle (see Figs. 3.3 and 3.4) represent early 
predictions, and the third (Fig. 3.5) presents flight data for longeron vibration 
based on Space Transportation System (STS) flights 1-4. It is instructive to 
compare Figs. 3.3 and 3.5 and note that the flight data yield higher frequency 
vibration and higher y-axis levels than predicted. This is not a serious problem, 
because trunion fitting slippage tends to isolate much of this vibration from the 
payload. Flight data for the keel fitting (not shown) are very close to the predicted 
curve (Fig. 3.4).

transient loads on the vehicle. Such loads, if excessive, can cause in-flight 
breakup or, on a lesser scale, violation of payload lateral load constraints. Thus, 
all launch vehicles will be subject to a wind shear constraint, the magnitude of 
which depends on the vehicle, as a condition of launch. 
For unguided ballistic and semiballistic entry vehicles, the primary effect of 
unmodeled wind shear is on landing point accuracy. For gliding entry vehicles 
such as the space shuttle, the threat of excessive wind shear is the same as that 
for ascent vehicles; excessive transient loads could overstress the vehicle. 
Also, of course, excessive unrnodeled headwinds, whether shear is present or 
not, reduce the vehicle's kinetic energy. Entry trajectory design and terminal 
area energy management schemes must incorporate reasonable worst-case 
headwind predictions, or risk failing to reach the intended runway. Several 
shuttle missions have reached the terminal area in an unexpectedly low 
energy state. 
Conceptually similar to wind shear is density shear, i.e., a sudden variation 
in layer density as a function of altitude. Shuttle flight experience has revealed 
drag-hence atmospheric density-variations of up to 19% over periods of a 
few  second^.^ Again, unmodeled drag variations are of concern for gliding 
entry vehicles, for which energy control is critical. Depending on the vehicle 
control system design, abrupt drag variations may result in an undesirable 
autopilot response. The space shuttle, for example, attempts to fly a nominal 
reference drag profile; differences between flight and reference values result 
in vehicle attitude adjustments as the autopilot seeks to converge on the 
nominal drag value. Spurious drag variations result in anomalous fuel

transient loads on the vehicle. Such loads, if excessive, can cause in-flight
breakup or, on a lesser scale, violation of payload lateral load constraints. Thus,
all launch vehicles will be subject to a wind shear constraint, the magnitude of
which depends on the vehicle, as a condition of launch. —

For unguided ballistic and semiballistic entry vehicles, the primary effect of
unmodeled wind shear is on landing point accuracy. For gliding entry vehicles
such as the space shuttle, the threat of excessive wind shear is the same as that
for ascent vehicles; excessive transient loads could overstress the vehicle.
Also, of course, excessive unmodeled headwinds, whether shear is present or
not, reduce the vehicle’s kinetic energy. Entry trajectory design and terminal
area energy management schemes must incorporate reasonable worst-case
headwind predictions, or risk failing to reach the intended runway. Several
shuttle missions have reached the terminal area in an unexpectedly low
energy state.

Conceptually similar to wind shear is density shear, i.e., a sudden variation
in layer density as a function of altitude. Shuttle flight experience has revealed
drag—hence atmospheric density—variations of up to 19% over periods of a
few seconds.> Again, unmodeled drag variations are of concern for gliding
entry vehicles, for which energy control is critical. Depending on the vehicle
control system design, abrupt drag variations may result in-an undesirable
autopilot response. The space shuttle, for example, attempts to fly a nominal
reference drag profile; differences between flight and reference values result
in vehicle attitude adjustments as the autopilot seeks to converge on the
nominal drag value. Spurious drag variations result in anomalous fuel

composites are often selected because of their higfi stiffness-to-weight ratio and 
low coefficient of thermal expansion, for applications where structural alignment 
is critical. Obviously, it is desirable to preserve on orbit the same structure as was 
fabricated on the ground. Outgassing is also a problem in that the vapor can 
recondense on optical or other surfaces where such material depositions would 
degrade the device performance. Even if the vapor does not condense, it can 
interfere with the desired measurements. For example, ultraviolet astronomy is 
effectively impossible in the presence of even trace amounts of water vapor. 
Outgassing is usually dealt with by selecting, in advance, those materials 
where it is less likely to be a problem. In cases where the material is needed 
because of other desirable properties, it will be "baked out" during a lengthy 
thermal vacuum session and then wrapped with tape or given some other coating 
to prevent re-absorption of water and other volatiles. Obviously, other spacecraft 
instruments and subsystems must be protected while the bake-out procedure is in 
progress. 
Removal of the adsorbed O2 layer in metals that do not form an oxide layer, 
such as stainless steel, can result in severe galling, pitting, and cold welding

applications in the space environment. 
Moving parts require lubrication, for which traditional methods are at best 
problematic in vacuum. Even on the ground, lubricants can degrade with time,

greatly exacerbated for the spaceflight regime, where we have unattended 
functional lifetimes measured in years, ambient pressures on the order of 
~/m~ or less, temperatures ranging from 200-350 K or to even greater 
extremes, and where outgassing or evaporation can pose significant problems for 
other instruments or subsystems. 
Space lubricants must therefore be selected with due consideration for the 
viscosity, vapor pressure, operating temperature range, and outgassing properties 
of the material. Of these, outgassing properties, which are treated in standard 
 reference^,^ are possibly the most important, because if the material outgasses 
substantially its other attributes, no matter how desirable, are unlikely to remain 
stable over time. 
3.5.2 Partial Vacuum 
Although the vacuum in low Earth orbit, for example at 200 km, is better than 
anything obtainable on the ground, it is by no means total. At shuttle operating 
altitudes, enough residual atmosphere remains to interact in a significant fashion

interactions between the upper atmosphere atomic and molecular species and 
spacecraft materials. 
It was noted during early shuttle missions that a pronounced blue 
glow appeared on various external surfaces while in the Earth's shadow. 
This was ascribed to recombination of atomic oxygen into molecular oxygen on 
contact with the shuttle skin. Although it presented no problems to the shuttle 
itself, the background glow is a significant problem for certain scientific 
observations. 
Apart from its role in generating shuttle glow, atomic oxygen is an extremely 
vigorous oxidizer, and its prevalence in LEO (--1014particles/cm2/s) 
dictates the use of non-oxidizing surface coverings for extended missions.

had been severely eroded by the action of atomic oxygen. It is now known that

The combined effects of thermal extremes and the near-vacuum environment, 
in combination with solar ultraviolet exposure, may alter the reflective and 
emissive characteristics of the external spacecraft surfaces. When these surfaces 
are tailored for a particular energy balance, as is often the case, degradation of the 
spacecraft thermal control system performance can result. Thus, long-lived 
spacecraft must have paint or coatings that are "nonyellowing" if changes in the 
overall thermal balance are to be minimized. 
A particularly annoying partial vacuum property is the relative ease with 
which low-density neutral gases are ionized, a phenomenon known as Paschen 
breakdown, which provides excellent but unintended conductive paths between 
points in electronic hardware that are at moderate to high potential differences. 
This tendency is aggravated by the fact that, at high altitudes, the residual 
molecular and atomic species are already partly ionized by solar ultraviolet light 
and various collision processes. 
The design of electronic equipment intended for use in launch vehicles is of 
course strongly affected by this fact, as is the design of spacecraft that are 
intended for operation in very low orbits. A key point is that, even though a 
spacecraft system (such as a command receiver or inertial navigation system) is 
intended for use only when in orbit, it may be turned on during ascent. If this is so, 
then care needs to be exercised to prevent electrical arcing during certain phases 
of flight. To this end, spacecraft equipment that must be on during the ascent

3.5.3 Space Plasma and Spacecraft Charging 
So far we have discussed the space and upper atmosphere environment 
as if it were electrically neutral. In fact, it is not, and it should be recognized as 
a plasma, i.e., a hot, heavily ionized medium often referred to as a "fourth state 
of matter," after solids, liquids, and gases.7 The universe is more than 
99% plasma by mass; "ordinary" matter is the rare exception. Plasmas are 
formed whenever there is sufficient energy to dissociate and ionize a gas and 
to keep it from cooling and recombining into a neutral state. The sheath of 
hot, ionized gas around a reentry vehicle is one example, the interstellar 
medium is another, and the interior of a star is yet another. 
Interplanetary space is filled with plasma generated by the sun within 
which the planets, asteroids, comets, etc., move. The magnetic fields of Jupiter, 
Saturn, and to a lesser extent Earth exert a magnetohydrodynamic effect 
on the plasma, shaping it into locally toroidal belts of charged particles, 
called Van Allen belts, in honor of their discoverer, whose radiation 
counter aboard Explorer 1 provided the first evidence of their existence.

3.5.3 Space Plasma and Spacecraft Charging

So far we have discussed the space and upper atmosphere environment
as if it were electrically neutral. In fact, it is not, and it should be recognized as
a plasma, i.e., a hot, heavily ionized medium often referred to as a “fourth state
of matter,” after solids, liquids, and gases.? The universe is more than
99% plasma by mass; “ordinary” matter is the rare exception. Plasmas are
formed whenever there is sufficient energy to dissociate and ionize a gas and
to keep it from cooling and recombining into a neutral state. The sheath of
hot, ionized gas around a reentry vehicle is one example, the interstellar
medium is another, and the interior of a star is yet another.

Interplanetary space is filled with plasma generated by the sun within
which the planets, asteroids, comets, etc., move. The magnetic fields of Jupiter,
Saturn, and to a lesser extent Earth exert a magnetohydrodynamic effect
on the plasma, shaping it into locally toroidal belts of charged particles,
called Van Allen: belts, in honor of their discoverer, whose radiation
counter aboard Explorer 1 provided the first evidence of their existence.
Usually these radiation belts have no visible effect; however, during
periods of high solar activity, a heavier than normal flow of charged
particles into the upper atmosphere can be redirected to the magnetic
polar regions, producing the result known as the aurora borealis, or “northern
lights.”

Motion of the magnetically active planets within the plasma produces an
interaction of the local planetary field with the interplanetary medium, creating a
“bow shock” very similar to that for a hypersonic entry vehicle in an atmosphere
(see Fig. 6.12), but shaped by electromagnetic forces rather than those of
continuum fluid dynamics. The motion of the sun through the local interstellar
medium produces a similar effect on a much larger scale. One goal of the
Voyager missions launched in 1977 was to reach, and thus help define, this solar
influence boundary.

The plasma, while essentially neutral as a whole, is populated with
moving, electrically charged particles, specifically electrons and positively
charged ions, generally having approximately equal kinetic energy. The flow
of charge defines an electric current, which is positive by definition if ions
are moving, and negative for moving electrons. The lightest possible ion is the
single proton, the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, with a mass 1840 times that of
the electron. Other ions are even more massive; thus, electrons move at
speeds orders of magnitude faster than ions, and even faster relative to any
spacecraft.

As the spacecraft moves through the plasma, it preferentially encounters
electrons, more of which bombard the spacecraft in a given time than do
the slower ions. There is thus a negative current tending to charge the
spacecraft. As the resulting negative charge grows, Coulomb forces
build, slowing accumulation of electrons and enhancing the attraction

of positively charged ions. Ultimately, the positive and negative currents 
equilibrate. This will occur with the spacecraft at a "floating potential" somewhat 
negative relative to that of the surrounding plasma, resulting from the preferential 
accumulation of the faster electrons, relative to the equally energetic, but 
more massive and thus slower, ions. This floating potential will depend on the 
orbit parameters, spacecraft size and geometry, solar cycle, terrestrial season, 
and other factors. 
Spacecraft charging can be "absolute" with respect to the plasma, 
"differential" with respect to different parts of a spacecraft, or both. If the 
spacecraft is highly conductive throughout, differential charging cannot occur. At 
lower altitudes, there is sufficient ion density in the plasma that large charge 
differences cannot develop even between separate, electrically isolated portions 
of a spacecraft. At GEO spacecraft altitude, this is not the case. If some portions 
of such a vehicle are electrically isolated from others, a substantial differential 
charge buildup can occur. When the point is reached at which the potential 
difference is sufficient to generate a high-voltage arc, charge equilibration will 
occur, quite possibly in a destructive manner. This behavior can occur at any 
time, but is greatly enhanced during periods of high solar activity. Numerous 
spacecraft have been damaged, or lost, due to this mechanism.89 It is for this 
reason that it is recommended that conduction paths be provided to all parts of a 
spacecraft, including especially thermal blankets, solar arrays, etc., as discussed 
in Chapter 8. 
While differential charging is not ordinarily of concern for LEO spacecraft, 
absolute charging of the spacecraft can cause problems. One effect is sputtering, 
in which large negative charges attract ions to impact the spacecraft at high 
speed, physically removing some surface atoms. This alters the thermal 
properties of the surface and adds to the contamination environment around the 
spacecraft. 
If there are no exposed conductors carrying different voltages, LEO spacecraft 
will tend to float within a few volts negative of the plasma. However, LEO 
spacecraft with exposed conductors at differing potential levels will exhibit 
differential charging, with the same possibilities for damage as for GEO 
spacecraft. It is found'' that the spacecraft will equilibrate at a negative potential 
with respect to the plasma, at roughly 90% of the most negative exposed 
spacecraft voltage. When all spacecraft operated at low bus voltages, e.g., the 28- 
V level that was standard for many years, this was not a problem. However, as 
spacecraft bus voltages have climbed (see Chapter lo), the arcing thresholds of 
common electrical conductors have been reached (e.g., copper, at around 40 V), 
with the attendant problems. 
A variety of effects can occur. The arcing itself produces electromagnetic 
interference @MI) that will generally be considered unacceptable. Such noise is 
not insignificant; in the case of the shuttle, the EM1 environment is dominated by 
plasma interaction noise. Solar arrays, which depend on maintaining a specified 
potential difference across the array, can develop arcs between exposed

A conductive spacecraft moving in a magnetic field is a generator. For large

difference between opposite ends of the vehicle. 
This effect is the basis of an interesting concept that has been proposed for 
generating power in low Earth orbit. A conductive cable several kilometers long 
would be deployed from a spacecraft and stabilized vertically in a gravity- 
gradient configuration (see Chapter 7). Motion in Earth's magnetic field would 
generate a current that could be used by the spacecraft, at the cost of some drag 
makeup propellant. A preliminary tether experiment was performed from the 
cargo bay of the space shuttle; however, mechanical problems with the 
deployment mechanism allowed only limited aspects of the technique to be

for a spacecraft and its contents. To some level of approximation this is 
true, but as with most absolute statements, it is inexact. A variety of effects

and 10-'lg, where lg is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface, 
9.81 m/s2.

3.5.4 Magnetic Field

A LEO spacecraft spends its operational lifetime in Earth’s magnetic field, and
planetary spacecraft encountering Jupiter or Saturn will experience similar but
stronger fields. Because the primary effect of the magnetic field is on the
spacecraft attitude control system, its characteristics are discussed in Chapter 7.
However, there can be other effects.

A conductive spacecraft moving in a magnetic field is a generator. For large
vehicles the voltage produced can be nontrivial. For example, it has been
estimated that the International Space Station may experience as much as a 20-V

3.5.5 Weightlessness and Microgravity

It is common to assume that orbital flight provides a weightless environment
for a spacecraft and its contents. To some level of approximation this is
true, but as with most absolute statements, it is inexact. A variety of effects
result in acceleration levels (i.c., “weight” per unit mass) between 1073
and 10°!!g, where 1g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth’s surface,
9.81 m/s’.

The acceleration experienced in a particular case will depend on the size
of the spacecraft, its configuration, its orbital altitude if in orbit about a planet
with an atmosphere, the solar cycle, and residual magnetic moment. Additionally,
78 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
the spacecraft will experience periodic impulsive disturbances resulting 
from attitude or translation control actuators, internal moving parts, or 
the activities of a human flight crew. If confined to the spacecraft interior, 
these disturbances may produce no net displacement of the spacecraft center 
of mass. However, for sensitive payloads such as optical instruments 
or materials-processing experiments that are fixed to the spacecraft, the result 
is the same. 
The most obvious external sources of perturbing accelerations are 
environmental influences such as aerodynamic drag and solar radiation pressure, 
both discussed in Chapter 4. If necessary, these and other nongravitational 
effects can be removed, to a level of better than 10-"g, by a disturbance- 
compensation system to yield essentially drag-free motion. This concept is 
discussed in Chapter 4 and has been used with navigation satellites, where the 
ability to remain on a gravitationally determined (thus highly predictable) 
trajectory is of value. 
The disturbance compensation approach referred to has inherently low 
bandwidth, and so cannot compensate for higher frequency disturbances, which 
we loosely classify as "vibration." For space rnicrogravity research, reduction of 
such vibration to very low levels is crucial, and usually requires the 
implementation of specialized systems to achieve.' ' 
A perturbing acceleration that cannot be removed is the so-called gravity- 
gradient force. Discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, this force results from the 
fact that only the spacecraft center of mass is truly in a gravitationally determined 
orbit. Masses on the vehicle that are closer to the center of the earth would, if in a 
free orbit, drift slowly ahead of those masses located farther away. Because the 
spacecraft is a more or less rigid structure, this does not happen; the internal 
elastic forces in the structure balance the orbital dynamic accelerations tending to 
separate masses orbiting at different altitudes. 
Gravity-gradient effects are significant (10M3g or possibly more) over large 
vehicles such as the shuttle or International Space Station. For most applications 
this may be unimportant. However, certain materials-processing operations are 
particularly demanding of low-gravity, low-vibration conditions and thus may 
need to be conducted in free-flying modules, where they can be located near the 
center of mass. Higher altitude also diminishes the effect, which follows an 
inverse-cube force law. 
Although we have so far discussed only the departures from the idealized Og 
environment, it is nonetheless true that the most pronounced and obvious 
condition associated with space flight is weightlessness. As with other 
environmental factors, it has both positive and negative effects on space vehicle 
design and flight operations. The benefits of weightlessness in certain 
manufacturing and materials-processing applications are in fact a significant 
practical motivation for the development of a major space operations 
infrastructure. Here, however, we focus on the effects of Og on the spacecraft 
functional design.

SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT 79 
The Og environment allows the use of relatively light spacecraft structures by 
comparison with earthbound designs. This is especially true where the structure is 
actually fabricated in orbit, or is packaged in such a way that it is not actually 
used or stressed until the transportation phase is complete. The International 
Space Station is an example of the former approach, while both the Apollo lunar 
module and the lunar roving vehicle are examples of the latter. A possibly 
awkward side effect of large, low-mass structures is that they tend to have 
relatively low damping and hence are susceptible to substantial structural 
excitation. Readers who have seen the films of the famous Tacoma Narrows 
Bridge disaster, the classic case in this regard, will be aware of the potential for 
concern. Less dramatically, attitude stabilization and control of large space 
vehicles are considerably complicated by structural flexibility. This is discussed 
in more detail in Chapter 7. 
In some cases, the relatively light and fragile mechanical designs appropriate 
for use in space render ground testing difficult. Booms and other deployable 
mechanisms may not function properly, or at least the same way, in a lg field if 
designed for Og or low g. Again, a case in point is the Apollo lunar rover. The 
actual lunar rover, built for one-sixth g, could not be used on Earth, and the lunar 
flight crews trained on a stronger version. In other cases, booms and articulating 
platforms may need to be tested by deploying them horizontally and supporting 
them during deployment in Earth's gravity field. 
The calibration and mechanical alignment of structures and instruments 
intended for use in flight can be a problem in that the structure may relax to a 
different position in the strain-free Og environment. For this and similar reasons, 
spacecraft structural mass is often dictated by stiffness requirements rather than 
by concerns over vehicle strength. Critical instrument alignment and orientation 
procedures are often verified by the simple artifice of making the necessary 
measurements in a 1g field, then inverting the device and repeating the 
measurements. If significant differences are not observed, the Og behavior is 
probably adequate. 
Weightlessness complicates many fluid and gasdynamic processes, including 
thermal convection, compared with ground experience. The situation is 
particularly exacerbated when one is designing for human presence. Effective 
toilets, showers, and cooking facilities are much harder to develop for use in Og. 
When convection is required for thermal control or for breathing air circulation, it 
must be provided by fans or pumps. The same is true of liquids in tanks; if 
convection is required to maintain thermal or chemical uniformity, it must 
be explicitly provided. Weightlessness is a further annoyance when liquids must 
be withdrawn from partially filled tanks, as when a rocket engine is ignited in 
orbit. Secondary propulsion systems will usually employ special tanks with 
pressurized bladders or wicking to ensure the presence of fuel in the combustion 
chamber. Larger engines are usually ignited following an ullage bum of a 
small thruster to force the propellant to settle in place over the intake lines to the 
engine.

80 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
As mentioned, a significant portion of the concern over spacecraft cleanliness 
during assembly is due to the desire to avoid problems from floating dust and 
debris once in orbit. Careful control over assembly operations is necessary to 
prevent dropped or forgotten bolts, washers, electronic components, tools, and 
other paraphernalia from causing problems in flight. Again, this may be of 
particular concern for manned vehicles, where an inhaled foreign object could be 
deadly. It is for this reason that the shuttle air circulation ports are screened; small 
objects tend to be drawn by air currents toward the intake screens, where they 
remain until removed by a crew member. 
Weightlessness imposes other design constraints where manned operations are 
involved. Early attempts at extravehicular operations during the Gemini program 
of the mid-1960s showed that inordinate and unexpected effort was required to 
perform even simple tasks in Og. Astronaut Gene Cernan on his Gemini 9 flight 
became so exhausted merely putting on his maneuvering backpack that he was 
unable to test the unit. Other astronauts experienced difficulty in handling their 
life-support tethers and in simply shutting the spacecraft hatch upon completion 
of extravehicular activity (EVA). 
These and other problems were in part caused by the bulkiness and limited 
freedom of movement possible in a spacesuit, but were to a greater extent due to 
the lack of body restraint normally provided by the combination of friction and 
the lg Earth environment. With careful attention to the placement of hand and 
foot restraints, it proved possible to accomplish significant work during EVA 
without exhausting the astronaut. This was demonstrated by Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin 
during the flight of Gemini 12 and put into practice "for real" by the Skylab 2 
crew of Conrad, Kerwin, and Weitz during the orbital repair of the Skylab 
workshop. Today, EVA is accepted as a risky and demanding, but still essentially 
routine, activity when conducted in a disciplined manner and guided by the 
principles that have been learned. This has been shown during a number of 
successful retrieval, repair, and assembly operations in the U.S. space shuttle, the 
Russian Mir, and the International Space Station programs. 
3.5.6 Radiation 
Naturally occurring radiation from numerous sources at a wide range of

is a source of ultraviolet (UV) and soft x-ray radiation and, on occasion, will eject 
a flux of very high energy protons in what is known as a "solar flare," or more 
technically as a "solar proton event." The Van Allen radiation belts surrounding 
Earth, the solar wind, and galactic cosmic rays are all sources of energetic 
charged particles of differing types. The radiation environment may be a problem 
for many missions, primarily due to the effect of high-energy charged particles on 
spacecraft electronic systems, but also in regard to the degradation of paints, 
coatings, and various polymeric materials as a result of prolonged UV exposure.

transistor logic (TTL) is even more resiliant, but likewise uses more power.

The other physical effect that occurs when particulate radiation interacts with 
other matter is localized ionization as the incoming particle slows down and 
deposits energy in the material. In silicon, for example, one hole-electron pair is 
produced for each 3.6 eV of energy expended by the incoming particle. Thus, 
even a relatively low energy cosmic ray of some lo7 eV will produce about 
3 x lo6 electrons, or 0.5 PC. This is a significant charge level in modem 
integrated circuitry and may result in a single-event upset, a state change from a

The single-event upset phenomenon has come about as a result of successful 
efforts to increase speed and sensitivity and reduce power requirements of 
electronic components by packing more semiconductor devices into a given 
volume. This is done essentially by increasing the precision of integrated circuit 
manufacture so that smaller circuits and devices may be used. For example, the 
mid-1980s state of the art in integrated circuit manufacturing resulted in devices 
with characteristic feature sizes on the order of 1 pm, while early-2000s designs 
approach 0.1 pm feature sizes. Ever-smaller circuits and transistor junctions 
imply operation at lower current and charge levels, obviously a favorable 
characteristic in most respects. However, beginning in the late 1970s and 
continuing thereafter, device "critical charge" levels reached the 0.01 -1 .O-pC 
range, where a single ionizing particle could produce enough electrons to change 
a "0" state to a "1," or vice versa. This phenomenon, first observed in ground- 
based computers, was explained in a classic work by May and ~oods.'~ Its 
potential for harm if the change of state occurs in a critical memory location is 
obvious. 
In practice, the damage potential of the single-event upset may exceed even

unfortunate in that CMOS components require very little power for operation and 
are thus attractive to the spacecraft designer. Latch-up protection is possible,

Charged-particle effects aré of basically two kinds: degradation due to total
dose and malfunctions induced by so-called single-event upsets. Fundamentally
different mechanisms are involved in these two failure modes.

N- or p-type metal-oxide semiconductors (NMOS or PMOS) are most
resistant to radiation effects than CMOS, but require more power. Transistor—
transistor logic (TTL) is even more resiliant, but likewise uses more power.

High-energy particulate radiation impacting a semiconductor device will
locally alter the carefully tailored crystalline structure of the device. After a
sufficient number of such events, the semiconductor is simply no longer the.
required type of material and ceases to function properly as an electronic device.
Total dose effects can be aggravated by the intensity of the radiation; a solar flare
can induce failures well below the levels normally tolerated by a given device. At
lower dose rates the device will anneal to some extent and “heal” itself, a survival
mechanism not available at higher rates.

The other physical effect that occurs when particulate radiation interacts with
other matter is localized ionization as the incoming particle slows down and
deposits energy in the material. In silicon, for example, one hole-electron pair is
produced for each 3.6 eV of energy expended by the incoming particle. Thus,
even a relatively low energy cosmic ray of some 10’ eV will produce about
3 x 10° electrons, or 0.5 pC. This is a significant charge level in modern
integrated circuitry and may result in a single-event upset, a state change from a
stored “zero” to a “one” in a memory or logic element.

The single-event upset phenomenon has come about as a result of successful
efforts to increase speed and sensitivity and reduce power requirements of
electronic components by packing more semiconductor devices into a given
volume. This is done essentially by increasing the precision of integrated circuit
manufacture so that smaller circuits and devices may be used. For example, the
mid-1980s state of the art in integrated circuit manufacturing resulted in devices
with characteristic feature sizes on the order of 1 zm, while early-2000s designs
approach 0.1 wm feature sizes. Ever-smaller circuits and transistor junctions
imply operation at lower current and charge levels, obviously a favorable
characteristic in most respects. However, beginning in the late 1970s and
continuing thereafter, device “critical charge” levels reached the 0.01-—1.0-pC
range, where a single ionizing particle could produce enough electrons to change
a “0” state to a “1,” or vice versa. This phenomenon, first observed in ground-
based computers, was explained in a classic work by May and Woods.!* Its
potential for harm if the change of state occurs in a critical memory location is
obvious.

In practice, the damage potential of the single-event upset may exceed even
that due to a serious software malfunction. If complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) circuitry is used, the device can “latch up” into a state
where it draws excessively high current, destroying itself. This is particularly
unfortunate in that CMOS components require very little power for operation and
are thus attractive to the spacecraft designer. Latch-up protection is possible,

altitudes, the magnetic field of the Earth deflects most of the incoming solar and 
galactic charged particle radiation. Because the configuration of the magnetic

Fortunately for the communications satellite industry, geostationary orbit 
at about six Earth radii is well beyond the worst of the outer belt and is in 
a region in which the shielding due to the spacecraft structure alone is 
quite effective. However, it may be seen that in a 10-year mission a 
lightly shielded component could accumulate a total dose of lo6 rad. To 
put this in perspective, Table 3.4 presents radiation resistance or "hardness" for 
various classes of electronic components. As this table shows, very few 
components can sustain this much radiation and survive. The situation becomes 
worse when one recognizes the need to apply a radiation design margin of 
the order of two in order to be certain that the components will complete the 
mission with unimpaired capability. For a dose of 1 Mrad and a design margin 
of 2, all components must be capable of 2 Mrad. At this level the choices are 
few, thus mandating increased shielding to guarantee an adequate suite of 
components for design. 
The example discussed earlier is not unreasonable. Most commercial 
communications satellites are designed for on-orbit lifetime of 5-7 years, and an 
extended lifetime of 10 years is quite reasonable as a goal. In many cases these 
vehicles do not recoup the original investment and begin to turn a profit until 
several years of operation have elapsed. 
.If the design requirements and operating environment do require shielding 
beiond that provided by the material thickness needed for structural 
requirements, it may still be possible to avoid increasing the structural thickness. 
Spot shielding is very effective for protecting individual sensitive components or 
circuits. Such shielding may be implemented as a box containing the hardware of 
interest. Another approach might be to use a potting compound loaded with 
shielding material. (Obviously, if the shielding substance is electrically 
conductive, care must be exercised to prevent any detrimental effect on the 
circuit.) An advantage offered by the nonstructural nature of spot shielding is that 
it allows for the possibility of using shielding materials, such as tantalum, that are 
more effective than the normal structural materials. This may allow some saving 
in mass. 
Alterations in the spacecraft configuration may also be used advantageously 
when certain circuits or components are particularly sensitive to the dose 
anticipated for a given mission and orbit. Different portions .of the spacecraft will 
receive different dosages according to the amount of self-shielding provided by 
the configuration. Thus, components placed near rectangular corners may receive 
as much as 175% of the dose of a component placed equally near the spacecraft 
skin, but in the middle of a large, thick panel. When some flexibility in the 
placement of internal electronics packages exists, these and other properties of 
the configuration may be exploited. 
A spacecraft in orbit above the Van Allen belts or in interplanetary space 
is exposed to solar-generated radiation and galactic cosmic rays. The dose 
levels from these sources are often negligible, although solar flares can 
contribute several kilorads when they occur. Galactic cosmic rays, as discussed

Manned flight above the Van Allen belts is a case where solar flares may 
have a potentially catastrophic effect. The radiation belts provide highly 
effective shielding against such flares, and in any case a reasonably rapid return to 
Earth is usually possible for any such close orbit. (This assumption may need 
to be reexamined for the case of future space station crews.) Once outside 
the belts, however, the received intensity of solar flare radiation may make 
it impractical to provide adequate shielding against such an event. For example, 
although the average flare can be contained, for human physiological purposes, 
with 2-4 g/cm2 of shielding, infrequent major events can require up to 
40 g/cm2, an impractical amount unless a vehicle is large enough to have 
an enclosed, central area to act as a "storm cellar." It is worth noting that

3.5.7 Micrometeoroids 
Micrometeoroids are somewhat of a hazard to spacecraft, although 
substantially less than once imagined. Meteoroid collision events have occurred, 
but rarely. The two highly probable known cases consist of geostationary 
spacecraft hit by small objects, probably meteoroids. In one case, the European 
Space Agency's Olympus satellite was lost as it consumed propellant in an 
attempt to recover. A Japanese satellite sustained a hit in one solar array, with the 
only result being a minor loss of power generation capacity.

3.5.7 Micrometeoroids

Micrometeoroids are somewhat of a hazard to spacecraft, although
substantially less than once imagined. Meteoroid collision events have occurred,
but rarely. The two highly probable known cases consist of geostationary
spacecraft hit by small objects, probably meteoroids. In one case, the European
Space Agency’s Olympus satellite was lost as it consumed propellant in an
attempt to recover. A Japanese satellite sustained a hit in one solar array, with the
only result being a minor loss of power generation capacity.

The standard micrometeoroid model’’ is based on data from numerous
sources, included the Pegasus satellites flown in Earth orbit specifically for the
purpose of obtaining micrometeoroid flux and penetration data, detectors flown
on various lunar and interplanetary spacecraft, and optical and radar observation
from Earth. This 1969 model still represents the best source of design information
available for near-Earth space. The model approximates near-Earth micro-
meteoroid flux vs particle mass by

when the particle mass m is in the range 107!'2g < m< 10~®g. For larger
particles such that 10-8g <'m < 1g, the appropriate relation is

These relationships are presented graphically in Fig. 3.27. For specific orbital
altitudes, gravitational focusing and the shielding effect of the planet must be
considered to derive the specific meteoroid flux environment for the orbit in
question.

Because of the gravitational attraction of the Earth, more meteoroids are found
at low altitudes than farther out. A correction for this focusing effect must be
applied when extrapolating near-Earth meteoroid flux data to high orbits or to
deep space. Assuming an average meteoroid velocity in deep space of 20 km/s,
Fig. 3.28 presents a curve of the defocusing factor that may be used to compute
the flux at a given altitude above Earth from the deep-space data of Fig. 3.27.

The increase in particle flux for low-altitude planetary orbits tends to be offset
by the shielding factor provided by the planet. The body shielding factor ¢ is

Figure 3.29 shows the geometry for the body shielding factor. Although 
particles vary considerably in density and velocity, for most purposes a density of 
0.5 g/cm3 and a velocity of 20 km/s are used as average values. 
It will be seen that most micrometeoroids are extremely small. To put the 
threat in perspective, a rule of thumb is that a particle of 1 pg will just penetrate a 
0.5-mm-thick sheet of aluminum. For most applications, the spacecraft external 
structure, thermal blankets, etc., provide adequate protection against particles 
with any significant probability of impact. For longer missions or more severe 
environments, additional protection may be needed, as with the Viking Orbiter 
propulsion system. This presented a fairly large area over a relatively long 
mission. More significantly, however, micrometeoroid impact on the pressurized 
tanks was highly undesirable, since, although penetration was extremely 
unlikely, the stress concentrations caused by the crater could have caused an 
eventual failure. The problem was dealt with by making the outer layer of the 
thermal blankets out of ~eflon@-impregnated glass cloth. 
The kinetic energy of micrometeoroids is typically so high that, upon impact, 
the impacting body and a similar mass of the impacted surface are vaporized. 
This leads to the concept of the "meteor bumper" proposed originally by Fred 
Whipple long before the first orbital flights. Although most spacecraft do not 
require protection of this magnitude, some very severe environments may dictate 
use of this concept. The concept involves placing a thin shield (material choice is 
not highly critical but is preferably metal) to intercept the incoming particle a 
short distance from the main structure of the pressure vessel. The thickness of the 
shield is dictated by the anticipated size of the particles. Ideally the shield should 
be just thick enough to ensure vaporization of the largest particles that have 
significant probability of being encountered. The spacing between the shield and 
the main structure is designed to allow the jet of vaporized material, which still 
has substantial velocity, to spread over a larger area before striking the main 
structure. The result of such an event is then a hole in the shield and possibly a 
dent or depression in the inner structure. Without the shield, a particle of 
sufficient mass and kinetic energy to dictate this type of protection could cause 
major damage. Even if it did not penetrate, the impact could result in spalling of 
secondary particles, still quite energetic, off the other side of the structure. Such 
particles could result in severe vehicle damage or crew injury. 
The perceptive reader will see that this ability of an impacting particle to spa11 
larger slower particles off the anti-impact side places a significant constraint on 
shield design. Any area that is made thicker than the optimum for vaporization, 
say, for attachment brackets, could become the source of secondary particles. 
These particles, being more massive than the original and possessing considerable 
kinetic energy, but not enough to vaporize them on impact, can be very 
damaging. It is clear from this brief discussion that design of such shields is an 
exacting task requiring both science and art. An actual flight application of this 
concept is the European Space Agency's Giotto probe, which flew through the 
dust cloud of Halley's Comet. In this instance the shield is only required on one

Naturally occurring particles are not the only or, at some altitudes, the most 
severe impact hazard. Nearly a half-century of essentially uncontrolled space 
operations has produced a major hazard in low Earth orbit. As of January 2000, 
nearly 9000 separate space objects larger than approximately 10 cm were being 
tracked and catalogued by the U.S. Space Command. Cumulatively, the 
population of tracked objects was estimated at almost 5 x lo6 kg. The number of 
smaller, but still very dangerous, objects is greater yet. Statistical estimates 
derived from ground telescope observations indicated the presence of 100,000- 
150,000 objects larger than 1 cm in diameter as of January 2000.'~ Impact 
sensors on various spacecraft have demonstrated the presence of literally billions 
of small particles, consisting mostly of paint flecks and aluminum oxide, in the 
0.01-0.5-mm range. In all such cases, the debris level exceeds, and sometimes 
greatly exceeds, the natural meteoroid background. 
This debris cloud has a variety of sources. Hundreds of explosions or other 
breakups of spacecraft or rocket stages have occurred, with no end immediately 
in sight. (Nine such events occurred in 1998 and again in 2001. In the latter year, 
one breakup occurred only 30 krn from the International Space Station.) In some 
cases this has occurred deliberately, or at least with no effort made to prevent it. 
For example, early Delta second stages were left with fuel tanks in a pressurized 
state following spacecraft separation, resulting in several on-orbit explosions. 
These explosions generated a considerable amount of long-lived debris. 
The situation is unlikely to improve in the near future. Approximately 2 x 
lo6 kg of spacecraft material resides at altitudes below 2000 km, most in the form 
of intact vehicles having characteristic dimensions on the order of 3 m. The 
varying orbital planes of these objects can produce high intersection angles and 
the potential for high collision velocities. As Kessler and ~our-~alais~~ have 
shown, such collisions are a statistical certainty and can be expected to contribute 
to an increasingly dense debris cloud. Routine space operations such as the firing 
of solid rocket motors, which generate extensive aluminum-oxide particulate 
debris, will also continue to add to the low-orbit hazard. 
In the early years of space operations, such considerations seemed 
unimportant, because space seemed to be "vast" and "limitless." Although

This debris cloud has a variety of sources. Hundreds of explosions or other
breakups of spacecraft or rocket stages have occurred, with no end immediately

one breakup occurred only 30 km from the International Space Station.) In some

For example, early Delta second stages were left with fuel tanks in a pressurized

altitudes. The debris flux appears to the worst in the altitude range of 600- 
1100 km. Below 200-300 km, atmospheric drag causes the debris orbits to decay 
rapidly into the atmosphere. Above 1100 km, the flux tapers off because of the 
increasing volume of space and because operations in these orbits have been 
more limited. 
While geosynchronous orbit is becoming crowded, the debris problem has not 
reached the severity of the lower altitude environment. This is in part because the 
large, potentially explosive booster stages that have contributed substantially to 
the low-orbit debris cloud do not reach geosynchronous altitude. However, it is 
also true that the communications satellite community was among the first to 
recognize that measures to minimize orbital clutter should be routinely 
employed. To this end, it has become standard practice in the industry to lift 
outmoded or nonfunctional satellites out of the geostationary ring, with fuel for 
this purpose included in the satellite design budget. 
Because of the high flux of particles in certain orbits, the probability of a 
debris strike on a spacecraft can be quite high. Worse still, there is a chance that 
the strike could involve a "large" particle of a few millimeters diameter. Such an

J 
Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) in 1990, after nearly six years in low 
Earth orbit (initially 510 km, decaying to about 325 km by the time of its 
recovery), provided extensive further data on the number and size distribution of 
particulate debris. 
These and other experiences have led to continuing efforts to update standard 
orbital debris models to reflect changing conditions. Figures 3.31 and 3.32 
present NASA results from the ORDEM2000 model, widely regarded as the 
current ~tandard.~' ORDEM2000 describes the debris environment in low Earth 
orbit between 200 and 2000 km altitude. The model is intended to provide 
engineering solutions estimates of the orbital debris environment (spatial density, 
flux, etc.). ORDEM2000 incorporates considerable observational data for object 
sizes from 10 mm to 10 m into its database, and uses a maximum likelihood 
estimator to convert these observations into debris population probability 
distribution functions. 
ORDEM2000 also performs orbital lifetime calculations based on the orbital 
parameters and ballistic coefficient of specified objects. The topic of orbital 
lifetime calculations is treated more fully in Chapter 4. 
Even a perfect debris model is not of much help to the spacecraft designer 
having the task of protecting his vehicle from hypervelocity particle impacts. 
Consisting primarily of particles of spacecraft and booster structural material, the 
debris has a much higher density than comet-derived meteoroid particles. For 
particles smaller than 1 cm, the density is taken to be 2.8 g/cm3 on average. For 
large particles, the particle density p is found to be approximately 
where D is the average diameter in centimeters. The average relative velocity is 
usually assumed to be 10 km/s. The requirement to withstand such impacts is 
obviously very challenging. 
Although local shielding of certain critical components or areas is possible, as 
is done, for example, on the International Space Station, completely annoring a 
spacecraft is not practical from a mass standpoint and in some cases may not even 
be possible. At this point, the most practical strategy may be to avoid high- 
probability orbits. As mentioned, the problem is expected to increase in severity 
for some years before greater awareness and increased use of various mitigation 
strategies begins to reverse the trend. A spate of antisatellite (ASAT) vehicle tests 
of the type conducted by the USSR on several occasions, and by the United States 
in September 1985, could greatly aggravate the problem. 
As an illustrative example of the effects of hypervelocity impact on orbital 
clutter, the September 1985 test, in which the P78-1 SOLWIND satellite was 
destroyed by an air-launched ASAT rocket, was estimated to have created 
approximately lo6 fragments between 1 rnm and 1 cm in diameter. This event 
alone thus produced, at an altitude sufficient to yield long-lived orbits, a debris 
environment in excess of the natural micrometeoroid background.

Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) in 1990, after nearly six years in low
Earth orbit (initially 510km, decaying to about 325 km by the time of its

particulate debris.

These and other experiences have led to continuing efforts to update standard
orbital debris models to reflect changing conditions. Figures 3.31 and 3.32
present NASA results from the ORDEM2000 model, widely regarded as the
current standard.?" ORDEM2000 describes the debris environment in low Earth

engineering solutions estimates of the orbital debris environment (spatial density,
flux, etc.). ORDEM2000 incorporates considerable observational data for object

estimator to convert these observations into debris population probability
distribution functions.

ORDEM2000 also performs orbital lifetime calculations based on the orbital
parameters and ballistic coefficient of specified objects. The topic of orbital
lifetime calculations is treated more fully in Chapter 4.

Even a perfect debris model is not of much help to the spacecraft designer
having the task of protecting his vehicle from hypervelocity particle impacts.
Consisting primarily of particles of spacecraft and booster structural material, the
debris has a much higher density than comet-derived meteoroid particles. For
particles smaller than 1 cm, the density is taken to be 2.8 g/cm? on average. For
large particles, the particle density p is found to be approximately

where D is the average diameter in centimeters. The average relative velocity is
usually assumed to be 10 km/s. The requirement to withstand such impacts is
obviously very challenging.

Although local shielding of certain critical components or areas is possible, as
is done, for example, on the International Space Station, completely armoring a
spacecraft is not practical from a mass standpoint and in some cases may not even
be possible. At this point, the most practical strategy may be to avoid high-
probability orbits. As mentioned, the problem is expected to increase in severity
for some years before greater awareness and increased use of various mitigation

As an illustrative example of the effects of hypervelocity impact on orbital
clutter, the September 1985 test, in which the P78-1 SOLWIND satellite was
destroyed by an air-launched ASAT rocket, was estimated to have created
approximately 10° fragments between 1 mm and 1 cm in diameter. This event
alone thus produced, at an altitude sufficient to yield long-lived orbits, a debris
environment in excess of the natural micrometeoroid background.

SPACECRAFT ENVIRONMENT 97 
It is possible to conduct such tests in a more suitable fashion. In September 
1986, the U.S. Department of Defense @OD) Strategic Defense Initiative 
I Organization conducted a boost-phase intercept test involving a collision 
between an experimental interceptor and a Delta 3920 second-stage rocket in 
powered flight. A direct hit at arelative velocity of approximately 3 km/s ensued. 
The chosen intercept altitude of about 220 km, which then became the highest 
possible perigee point of any collision debris, ensured that the residue from the 
collision remained in orbit for at most a few months.22 
Numerous national and international efforts have been undertaken to 
increase the level of awareness of the space debris problem and to develop and 
promulgate mitigation strategies for the future.lg Among the recommended 
approaches are (1) cessation of deliberate spacecraft breakups producing 
debris in long-lived orbits; (2) minimization of mission-related debris generation; 
(3) passivation of spacecraft and rocket bodies remaining in orbit after mission 
completion, i.e., expending residual propellants, discharging batteries, venting 
tanks, etc.; (4) selection of transfer orbit parameters to ensure reentry of 
spent transfer stages within 25 years; and (5) boosting separated apogee kick 
motors, other transfer stages used for geostationary spacecraft circularization, 
and defunct geostationary satellites to an altitude at least 300 km above the 
geostationary ring. 
Mitigation measures such as these obviously place an additional burden on 
space vehicle design and operation not present in earlier years. For this reason, 
while international cooperation over debris mitigation has increased in recent 
years, full compliance continues to elude the space community. Space operations 
and plans must increasingly take into account strategies for avoiding, or coping

space shuttle received four collision-avoidance warnings and acted upon three of 
them.23 It has been estimated that the International Space Station can expect to 
receive about 10 collision avoidance warnings per year of sufficient concern that 
an avoidance maneuver could be required.24

It is possible to conduct such tests in a more suitable fashion. In September
1986, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization conducted a boost-phase intercept test involving a collision
between an experimental interceptor and a Delta 3920 second-stage rocket in
powered flight. A direct hit at a relative velocity of approximately 3 km/s ensued.
The chosen intercept altitude of about 220 km, which then became the highest
possible perigee point of any collision debris, ensured that the residue from the
collision remained in orbit for at most a few months.”

Numerous national and international efforts have been undertaken to.
increase the level of awareness of the space debris problem and to develop and
promulgate mitigation strategies for the future.'? Among the recommended
approaches are (1) cessation of deliberate spacecraft breakups producing
debris in long-lived orbits; (2) minimization of mission-related debris generation;
(3) passivation of spacecraft and rocket bodies remaining in orbit after mission
completion, i.e., expending residual propellants, discharging batteries, venting
tanks, etc.; (4) selection of transfer orbit parameters to ensure reentry of
spent transfer stages within 25 years; and (5) boosting separated apogee kick
motors, other transfer stages used for geostationary spacecraft circularization,
and defunct geostationary satellites to an altitude at least 300 km above the
geostationary ring.

Mitigation measures such as these obviously place an additional burden on
space vehicle design and operation not present in earlier years. For this reason,
while international cooperation over debris mitigation has increased in recent
years, full compliance continues to elude the space community. Space operations
and plans must increasingly take into account strategies for avoiding, or coping
with, orbital debris. For example, in the five years between 1989 and 1994, the
space shuttle received four collision-avoidance warnings and acted upon three of
them.”? It has been estimated that the International Space Station can expect to
receive about 10 collision avoidance warnings per year of sufficient concern that
an avoidance maneuver could be required.”

3.5.9 Thermal Environment

Space flight presents both a varied and extreme thermal environment to the
space vehicle designer. Spacecraft thermal control is an important topic in its own
right, and will be treated in more detail in Chapter 9. However, it is appropriate in
this section to survey some of the environmental conditions that must be
addressed in the thermal design.

The space vacuum environment essentially allows only one means of
energy transport to and from the spacecraft, that of radiative heat transfer.
The overall energy balance is therefore completely defined by the solar
and planetary heat input, internally generated heat, and the radiative energy
transfer properties that are determined by the spacecraft configuration and

materials. The source and sink temperatures (from the sun with a characteristic 
blackbody temperature of 5780 K and dark space at 3 K, respectively) for 
radiative transfer are extreme. 
Under these conditions, extremes of both temperature and temperature 
gradient are common. Thermally isolated portions of an Earth-orbiting spacecraft 
can experience temperature variations from roughly 200 K during darkness to 
about 350 K in direct sunlight. One has only to consider such everyday 
experiences as the difficulty of starting a car in very cold weather, with battery 
and lubrication problems, or very hot weather (which may cause carburetor vapor 
lock) to appreciate that most machinery functions best at approximately the same 
temperatures as do humans. 
If appropriate internal conduction paths are not provided, temperature 
differences between the sunlit and dark sides of a spacecraft can be almost as 
severe as the extremes cited earlier. This results in the possibility of damage or 
misalignment due to differential expansion in the material. Space vehicles are 
sometimes rolled slowly about an axis normal to the sun line to minimize this 
eflect. When this is impractical, and other means to minimize thermal gradients 
are not suitable, special materials having a very low coefficient of thermal 
expansion (such as lnvarB or graphite-epoxy) may need to be employed. 
The fatiguing effect on materials of repeated thermal cycling between such 
extremes is also a problem and has resulted in many spacecraft component and 
subsystem failures. One relevant example was that of LANDSAT-D, where the 
solar cell harness connections were made overly tight and pulled loose after 
repeated thermal cycling, ultimately disabling the spacecraft. 
Thermal system design in vacuum is further complicated by the need for 
special care in ensuring good contact between bolted or riveted joints. Good 
thermal conductivity under such conditions is difficult to obtain, hard to quantify, 
and inconsistent in its properties. Use of a special thermal contact grease or pad is 
required to obtain consistently good conductive heat transfer. 
The lack of free convection has been mentioned in connection with the 
Og environment; it is, of course, equally impossible in vacuum: Heat transfer 
internal to a spacecraft is therefore by means of conduction and radiation, 
in contrast to ground applications in which major energy transport is typically 
due to both free and forced convection. This results in the need for 
careful equipment design to ensure appropriate conduction paths away from 
all internal hot spots and detailed analytical verification of the intended 
design. This may sometimes be avoided by hermetically sealing an individual 
package or, as is common for Russian spacecraft, by sealing the whole vehicle. 
The disadvantage here is obviously that a single leak can result in loss of 
the mission. 
The atmospheric entry thermal environment is the most severe normally 
encountered by a spacecraft, and vehicles designed for this purpose employ a host 
of special features to achieve the required protection. This is discussed in more 
detail in Chapters 6 and 9.

It is well beyond the scope of this text to discuss in detail the environment of

4.1. Introduction

Astrodynamics is the study of the motion of man-made objects in space
subject to both natural and artificially induced forces. It is the latter factor that
lends a design element to astrodynamics that is lacking in its parent science,
celestial mechanics. The function of the astrodynamicist is to synthesize
trajectories that, within the limits imposed by physics and launch vehicle
performance, accomplish desired mission goals. Experience gained since the
dawn of the space age in 1957, together with the tremendous growth in the speed
and sophistication of computer analyses, have allowed the implementation of
mission designs not foreseen by early pioneers in astronautics. This trend was
discussed briefly in Chapter 2 and shows every sign of continuing. The use of
halo orbits' for the International Sun-Earth Explorer (SEE) and Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe missions, the development of space colony
concepts using the Earth-moon Lagrangian points,” together with the analysis by
Heppenheimer’ of “achromatic” trajectories to reach these points from the moon,
and the extensive modern use of gravity-assist maneuvers’ for interplanetary
missions are but a few examples.

Astrodynamics, through its links to classical astronomy, has its roots in the
very origins of the scientific revolution. The mathematical elegance of the field
exceeds that found in any other area of astronautics. Problems posed in celestial
mechanics have been a spur to the development of both pure and applied
mathematics since Newton’s development of the calculus (which he used, among
other things, to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion and to show that a
spherically symmetric body acts gravitationally as if its mass were concentrated
at a point at its center). Hoyle” comments on this point and notes that it has not
been entirely beneficial; the precomputer emphasis on analytical solutions led to
the development of many involved methods and “tricks” useful in the solution of
celestial mechanics problems. Many of these methods persist to the present as an
established part of mathematics education, despite having little relevance in an
era of computational sophistication.

Because of the basic simplicity of the phenomena involved, it is possible in
astrodynamics to make measurements and predictions to a level of accuracy
exceeded in few fields. For example, it is not unusual to measure the position of
an interplanetary spacecraft (relative to its tracking stations) to an accuracy of

less than a kilometer. Planets such as Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, which have been 
orbited by spacecraft, can now be located to within several tens of meters out of I 
hundreds of millions of kilometers. Such precision is attained only at the price of 
extensive data processing and considerable care in modeling the solar system 
environment. 
We shall not engage in detailed consideration of the methods by which the 
highest possible degree of precision is attained. Although it is true that the most 
accurate methods of orbit prediction and determination are desirable in the actual 
execution of a mission, such accuracy is rarely needed at the levels of mission 
definition appropriate to spacecraft design. What is required is familiarity with 
basic orbit dynamics and an understanding of when and why more complex 
calculations are in order. We take the view that the spacecraft system engineer I 
requires a level of competence in astrodynamics approximately defined by the 
range of methods suitable for solution via pocket calculator. Any analysis 
absolutely requiring a computer for its completion is in general the province of

less than a kilometer, Planets such as Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, which have been
orbited by spacecraft, can now be located to within several tens of meters out of
hundreds of millions of kilometers. Such precision is attained only at the price of
extensive data processing and considerable care in modeling the solar system
environment.

We shall not engage in detailed consideration of the methods by which the
highest possible degree of precision is attained. Although it is true that the most
accurate methods of orbit prediction and determination are desirable in the actual
execution of a mission, such accuracy is rarely needed at the levels of mission
definition appropriate to spacecraft design. What is required is familiarity with
basic orbit dynamics and an understanding of when and why more complex
calculations are in order. We take the view that the spacecraft system engineer
requires a level of competence in astrodynamics approximately defined by the
range of methods suitable for solution via pocket calculator. Any analysis
absolutely requiring a computer for its completion is in general the province of
specialists.

The study of, hyperbolic orbits is accorded substantially more attention in 
astrodynamics than it traditionally receives in celestial mechanics. In celestial 
mechanics, only comets pursue escape orbits, and these are generally almost 
parabolic; hence, orbit prediction and determination methods tend to center 
around perturbations to parabolic trajectories. In contrast, all interplanetary 
missions follow hyperbolic orbits, both for Earth departure and upon amval at 
possible target planets. Also, study of the gravity-assist maneuvers mentioned 
earlier requires detailed analysis of hyperbolic trajectories. 
Figure 4.4 shows the parameters of interest for hyperbolic orbits. Because a 
hyperbolic orbit of mass m and body M is a one-time event (possibly terminated 
by a direct atmospheric entry or a propulsive or atmospheric braking maneuver to 
effect orbital capture), the encounter is often referred to as hyperbolic passage. 
Although described by the same basic conic equation as for an elliptic orbit, 
hyperbolic passage presents some significant features not found with closed 
orbits. 
In this section, we consider only the encounter between rn and M, i.e., the two- 
body problem; hence, motion of M is ignored. Thus, if m is a spacecraft and M a 
planetary flyby target, then the separate motion of both m and M in solar orbit is 
neglected. This is equivalent to regarding the influence of M as dominating the 
encounter and ignoring that of the sun. This is, of course, the same approximation 
we have used in the preceding discussions, and, when m and M are relatively 
close, it is not a major source of error in the analysis of interest here. For example, 
the gravitational influence of the sun on a spacecraft in low Earth orbit will not 
usually be of significance in preliminary mission design and analysis. 
Hyperbolic passage is fundamentally different. Although the actual encounter 
can indeed be modeled as a two-body phenomenon to the same fidelity as before, 
the complete passage must usually be examined in the context of the larger 
reference frame in which it takes place. This external frame provides the "infinity 
conditions" and orientation for the hyperbolic passage, and it is in this frame that 
gravity-assisted velocity changes must be analyzed. For the present, however, we 
consider only the actual two-body encounter. The results will be useful within a 
so-called sphere of influence (actually not a sphere and not sharply defined) about

subsequent section.

4.2.4 Motion in Hyperbolic Orbits

The study of hyperbolic orbits is accorded substantially more attention in
astrodynamics than it traditionally receives in celestial mechanics. In celestial
mechanics, only comets pursue escape orbits, and these are generally almost
parabolic; hence, orbit prediction and determination methods tend to center
around perturbations to parabolic trajectories. In contrast, all interplanetary
missions follow hyperbolic orbits, both for Earth departure and upon arrival at
possible target planets. Also, study of the gravity-assist maneuvers mentioned
earlier requires detailed analysis of hyperbolic trajectories.

Figure 4.4 shows the parameters of interest for hyperbolic orbits. Because a
hyperbolic orbit of mass m and body M is a one-time event (possibly terminated
by a direct atmospheric entry or a propulsive or atmospheric braking maneuver to
effect orbital capture), the encounter is often referred to as hyperbolic passage.
Although described by the same basic conic equation as for an elliptic orbit,
hyperbolic passage presents some significant features not found with closed
orbits.

In this section, we consider only the encounter between m and M, i.e., the two-
body problem; hence, motion of M is ignored. Thus, if m is a spacecraft and M a
planetary flyby target, then the separate motion of both m and M in solar orbit is
neglected. This is equivalent to regarding the influence of M as dominating the
encounter and ignoring that of the sun. This is, of course, the same approximation
we have used in the preceding discussions, and, when m and M are relatively
close, it is not a major source of error in the analysis of interest here. For example,
the gravitational influence of the sun on a spacecraft in low Earth orbit will not
usually be of significance in preliminary mission design and analysis.

Hyperbolic passage is fundamentally different. Although the actual encounter
can indeed be modeled as a two-body phenomenon to the same fidelity as before,
the complete passage must usually be examined in the context of the larger
reference frame in which it takes place. This external frame provides the “infinity
conditions” and orientation for the hyperbolic passage, and it is in this frame that
gravity-assisted velocity changes must be analyzed. For the present, however, we
consider only the actual two-body encounter. The results will be useful within a
so-called sphere of influence (actually not a sphere and not sharply defined) about

the target body M. Determination of spheres of influence will be addressed in a

subsequent section.
When m is “infinitely” distant from M, the orbit equation may be solved with
r = 00 to yield the true anomaly of the asymptotes. From Eq. (4.7),

In classical celestial mechanics, position and velocity information are never 
directly attainable. Only the angular coordinates (right ascension and declination) 
of objects on the celestial sphere are directly observable. Classical orbit 
determination is essentially the process of specifying orbital position and velocity 
given a time history of angular coordinate measurements. Direct measurement of 
r and V (or their relatively simple calculation from given data) is possible in 
astrodynamics, where ground tracking stations and/or onboard guidance systems 
may, for example, supply position and velocity vector estimates on a nearly 
continuous basis.. 
However, even when r and V are obtained, information in this form is of 
mathematical utility only, because it conveys no physical "feel" for or geometric 
'picture" of the orbit. It is thus customary to describe the orbit in terms of six 
other quantities plus an epoch, a time to at which they apply. These quantities, 
chosen to provide a more direct representation of the motion, are the Keplerian 
orbital elements, defined graphically in Fig. 4.6 and listed in the following: 
a or p = semimajor axis or semilatus rectum 
e = eccentricity 
i = inclination of orbit plane relative to a defined reference plane 
R = longitude or right ascension of ascending node, measured in the reference 
plane from a defined reference meridian 
o = argument of periapsis, measured counterclockwise from the ascending 
node in the orbit plane 
Oo, Mo, or t, = true or mean anomaly at epoch, or time of relevant periapsis 
passage 
As seen, there is no completely standardized set of elements in use, a 
circumstance in part due to physical necessity. For example, the semimajor axis a 
is undefined for parabolic orbits and observationally meaningless for hyperbolic 
orbits, requiring use of a more fundamental quantity, the semilatus rectum p, or 
occasionally the angular momentum h. Nonetheless, the geometric significance 
and convenience of the semimajor axis for circular and elliptic orbits will not be 
denied, and it is always employed when physicaIly meaningful. 
Other problems occur as well. For nearly circular orbits, o is ill defined, as is 
$2 for orbits with near-zero inclination. In such cases, various convenient 
alternate procedures are used to establish a.well-defined set of orbital elements. 
For example, when the orbit is nominally circular, w = 0 is often adopted by 
convention. When i 2: 0, accurate specification of 42 and hence w is difficult, and 
the parameter ll, the so-called longitude of periapsis, is often used. Here,

influences or perturbations are always present and result in a departure from 
purely Keplerian motion; hence, the orbital elements are not constant. Perturbing 
influences can be of both gravitational and nongravitational origin and may 
include aerodynamic drag, solar radiation, and solar wind; the presence of a third 
body; a nonspherically symmetric mass distribution in an attracting body; or, in 
certain very special cases, relativistic effects. One or more of these effects will be 
important in all detailed analyses, such as are necessary for the actual execution 
of a mission, and in many cases for preliminary analysis and mission design as 
well. Indeed, it is common practice in mission design to make use of certain 
special perturbations to achieve desired orbital coverage, as discussed briefly in 
Chapter 2 and in Sec. 4.3.3 (Aspherical Mass Distribution). 
It commonly happens that a spacecraft or planetary trajectory is predomi- 
nantly Keplerian, but that there exist perturbations that are significant at some 
level of mission design or analysis. When approximate analyses of such cases are 
canied out, it may be found that the perturbing influences alter various elements 
or combinations of elements in a periodic manner, or in a secular fashion with a 
time constant that is small compared to the orbit period. Such analyses may be 
used to provide relatively simple corrections to a given set of orbital elements 
describing the average motion, or to a set of elements accurately defined at some 
epoch. 
The result of procedures such as those just described is a description of the 
orbit in terms of a set of osculating elements, which are time varying and describe 
a Keplerian orbit that is instantaneously tangent to the true trajectory. In this way 
increased accuracy can be obtained while still retaining a description of the 
motion in terms of orbital elements, i.e., without resorting to a numerical 
solution. These topics will be considered in more detail in a later section.

Within the fixed orbit plane of two-body Keplerian motion, ths coordinate

from periapsis. This system of perifocal or orbit plane coordinates is both natural 
and sufficient as long as the orientation of the orbit in space need not be 
considered. 
However, we have seen in the preceding discussion that a particular orbit is 
defined through its elements in relation to a known inertial reference frame, as 
shown in Fig. 4.6. There are two major inertial reference frames of interest. 
The X axis in all cases of interest in the solar system is defined in the direction 
of the vernal equinox, the position of the sun against the fixed stars on (presently) 
March 21, the first day of spring. More precisely, the X axis is the line from the 
center of the Earth to the center of the sun when the sun crosses the Earth's 
equatorial plane from the southern to northern hemisphere.

4.2.7 Coordinate Frames

Within the fixed orbit plane of two-body Keplerian motion, the coordinate
system of choice is the polar coordinate system depicted in Fig. 4.2. The position
of the object is given by the coordinates (r, 0), with the true anomaly 6 measured
from periapsis. This system of perifocal or orbit plane coordinates is both natural
and sufficient as long as the orientation of the orbit in space need not be
considered.

However, we have seen in the preceding discussion that a particular orbit is
defined through its elements in relation to a known inertial reference frame, as
shown in Fig. 4.6. There are two major inertial reference frames of interest.

The X axis in all cases of interest in the solar system is defined in the direction
of the vernal equinox, the position of the sun against the fixed stars on (presently)
March 21, the first day of spring. More precisely, the X axis is the line from the
center of the Earth to the center of the sun when the sun crosses the Earth’s
equatorial plane from the southern to northern hemisphere.

For orbits about or observations from Earth (or, when appropriate, any other 
planet), the natural reference plane is the planetary equator. The orbital 
inclination i is measured with respect to the equatorial plane, and the longitude of 
the ascending node i2 is measured in this plane. The positive Z direction is taken 
normal to the reference plane in the northerly direction (i.e., approximately 
toward the North Star, Polaris, for Earth). The Y axis is taken to form a right- 
handed set and thus lies in the direction of the winter solstice, the position of the 
sun as seen from Earth on the first day of winter. 
The coordinate frame thus defined is referred to as the geocentric inertial 
(GCI) system. Though fixed in the Earth, it does not rotate with the planet. It is 
seen that, in labeling the frame as "inertial," the angular velocity of the Earth 
about the sun is ignored. Because the frame is defined with respect to the 
"infinitely" distant stars, the translational offsets of the frame throughout the year 
are also irrelevant, and any axis set parallel to the defined set is equally valid. 
It will often be necessary to transform vectors (r, V) in orbit plane coordinates 
to their equivalents in inertial space. From Fig. 4.6, it is clear that this can be 
accomplished in three steps, starting with the assumption that the orbit plane is 
coincident with the inertial X-Y plane, and that the abscissas are co-aligned: 
1) Rotate the orbit plane by angle i2 about the inertial Z axis (colinear with the 
angular momentum vector h). 
2) Rotate the orbit plane about the new line of nodes by inclination i. 
3) Perform a final rotation about the new angular momentum vector (also the 
new Z axis) by angle w, the argument of periapsis.

For orbits about or observations from Earth (or, when appropriate, any other
planet), the natural reference plane is the planetary equator. The orbital
inclination i is measured with respect to the equatorial plane, and the longitude of
the ascending node 12) is measured in this plane. The positive Z direction is taken
normal to the reference plane in the northerly direction (i.c., approximately
toward the North Star, Polaris, for Earth). The Y axis is taken to form a right-
handed set and thus lies in the direction of the winter solstice, the position of the
sun as seen from Earth on the first day of winter.

The coordinate frame thus defined is referred to as the geocentric inertial
(GCI) system. Though fixed in the Earth, it does not rotate with the planet. It is
seen that, in labeling the frame as “inertial,” the angular velocity of the Earth
about the sun is ignored. Because the frame is defined with respect to the
“fnfinitely” distant stars, the translational offsets of the frame throughout the year
are also irrelevant, and any axis set parallel to the defined set is equally valid.

It will often be necessary to transform vectors (r, V) in orbit plane coordinates
to their equivalents in inertial space. From Fig. 4.6, it is clear that this can be
accomplished in three steps, starting with the assumption that the orbit plane is
coincident with the inertial X—Y plane, and that the abscissas are co-aligned:

1) Rotate the orbit plane by angle 1 about the inertial Z axis (colinear with the
angular momentum vector f).

2) Rotate the orbit plane about the new line of nodes by inclination i.

3) Perform a final rotation about the new angular momentum vector (also the
new Z axis) by angle w, the argument of periapsis.

In the terminology of rotational transformations (see also Chapter 7), this is a
3-1-3 Euler angle rotation sequence composed of elementary rotation matrices:

Cw -Sw O|/1 0 O cQ -SO 0
Tp4r=| So Co O}1(0 Ci -Si}|} SA CQO O (4.55)

This yields the rotation matrix that transforms a vector in perifocal coordinates
into a vector in the inertial frame. In combined form, with $@ and C@ representing
sin@ and cos@, we have

COCw—-SOSeCi —COSw-SACweCi SOSi
Tp+1 = | SACw+ COSaCi -—SOSw+COACwCi —COSi (4.56)

Transformation matrices are orthonormal, and so the inverse transformation
(in this case, from inertial to orbit plane coordinates) is found by transposing Eq.
(4.56):

For heliocentric calculations, planetary equators are not suitable reference
planes, and another choice is required. It is customary to define the Earth’s orbital

plane about the sun, the ecliptic plane, as the reference plane for the solar system. 
The Earth's orbit thus has zero inclination, by definition, whereas all other solar 
orbiting objects have some nonzero inclination. The Z axis of this heliocentric 
inertial (HCI) system is again normal to the reference plane in the (roughly) 
northern direction, and the Y axis again is taken to form a right-handed set. The 
Earth's polar axis is inclined at approximately 23.5" relative to the ecliptic, and so 
the transformation from GCI to HCI is accomplished via a coordinate rotation of 
23.5" about the X axis. The relationship between these two frames is shown in 
Fig. 4.7. 
In either system, a variety of coordinate representations are possible in 
addition to the basic Cartesian (X, Y, Z) frame. The choice will depend in part on 
the type of equipment and observations employed. For example, a radar or other 
radiometric tracking system will produce information in the form of range to the 
spacecraft, azimuth angle measured from due North, and elevation angle above 
the horizon. Given knowledge of the tracking station location, such information 
is readily converted to standard spherical coordinates (r, 6, 4) and therefore to 
(X, Y, 2) or other coordinates. 
When optical observations are made, as in classical orbit determination or 
when seeking to determine the position of an object against the background of 
fixed stars, range is not a suitable parameter. All objects appear to be located at 
the same distance and are said to be projected onto the celestial sphere. In this 
case, only angular information is available, and a celestial longitude-latitude 
system similar to that used for navigation on Earth is adopted. Longitude and 
latitude are replaced by right ascension and declination (a, 6). Right ascension is 
measured in the conventional trigonometric sense in the equatorial plane (about 
the Z axis), with 0" at the X axis. Declination is positive above and negative below 
the equatorial (X-Y) plane, with a range of + 90". Figure 4.8 shows the

As a matter of engineering practice, the single-measurement errors in vehicle 
position and velocity are of such magnitude as to result in a rather crude estimate 
of the orbit from one observation, and so rather elaborate filtering and estimation 
algorithms are employed in actual mission operations to obtain accurate results. 
However, for mission design and analysis such issues are unimportant, and it is of 
interest to know the orbital elements in terms of nominal position and velocity 
vectors. This information is also of use in sensitivity studies, in which the 
orbit dispersions that result from specified launch vehicle injection errors (see 
Chapter 5) are examined. 
It is assumed that r and V are known in a coordinate system of interest, such as 
GCI for Earth orbital missions or HCI for planetary missions. In practice, one or 
more coordinate transformations must be performed to obtain data in the required 
form, because direct measurements will be made in coordinates appropriate to a 
ground-based tracking station or network. It is assumed here that i, j, and k are the

The location of the launch site (or, more accurately, the location and timing of
actual booster thrust termination) is a determining factor in the specification of
some orbital elements. Of these, the possible range of orbital inclinations is the
most important. Qualitatively, it is clear that not all inclinations are accessible
from a given launch site. For example, if injection into orbit does not occur
ASTRODYNAMICS 129 
precisely over the equator, an equatorial orbit is impossible, because the 
orbit plane must include the injection point. This is shown quantitatively by 
Bate et al.I5: 
cos i = sin +cos A (4.75) 
where 
4 = injection azimuth (North = 0") 
h = injection latitude. 
If the boost phase is completed quickly so that injection is relatively close to the 
launch site, conditions for 4 and A as determined for the initial launch azimuth 
and latitude approximate those at vehicle burnout. 
Equation (4.75) implies that direct orbits (i < 90") require 0"s 4 5 180°, and 
furthermore that the orbital inclination is restricted to the range lil IAl. 
The longitude of the ascending node 42 also depends on the injection 
conditions, in this case the injection time. This is because launch is from a 
rotating planet, whereas R is defined relative to the fixed vernal equinox. When 
the choice of 420 is important, as for a sun-synchronous orbit (see Sec. 4.3.3, 
Aspherical Mass Distribution), the allowable launch window can become quite 
small. 
4.2.9 State Vector Propagation from Initfal Condftions 
Tn practical work it is often desired to compute the orbital state vector (r, V) at

allows us to do so as follows: 
1) From (rO. VO), compute the orbital elements using Eqs. (4.59-4.74). 
2) Use the appropriate form of Kepler's equation, depending on eccentricity, 
to find true anomaly 8(t) given 60 = O0(to). 
3) Determine r from Eq. (4.7), the orbit equation. 
4) Use (for example) Eqs. (4.29-4.30) to find V,, VB, hence (r, V) in orbit- 
plane coordinates. 
5) Apply the appropriate coordinate transformation Eq. (4.56) to convert (r, V) 
from orbit plane coordinates to GCI or HCI. 
This process, while conceptually clear, is undeniably awkward. Some 
improvement may be realized after 8(t) is obtained in step 2 through the use of the 
Lagrangian  coefficient^,'^"^"^ where the dependence on initial conditions is 
expressed as

orbit plane must include the injection point. This is shown quantitatively by
Bate et al.'>:

¢ = injection azimuth (North = 0°)
A = injection latitude.

If the boost phase is completed quickly so that injection is relatively close to the
launch site, conditions for @ and A as determined for the initial launch azimuth
and latitude approximate those at vehicle burnout.

Equation (4.75) implies that direct orbits (i < 90°) require 0°< @ < 180°, and
furthermore that the orbital inclination is restricted to the range |i{ > [Al.

The longitude of the ascending node 0, also depends on the injection
conditions, in this case the injection time. This is because launch is from a
rotating planet, whereas 0, is defined relative to the fixed vernal equinox. When
the choice of Op is important, as for a sun-synchronous orbit (see Sec. 4.3.3,

2) Use the appropriate form of Kepler’s equation, depending on eccentricity,
to find true anomaly 6(f) given 0) = 9 (to).

3) Determine r from Eq. (4.7), the orbit equation.

4) Use (for example) Egs. (4.29—4.30) to find V,, Vg, hence (r, V) in orbit-
plane coordinates.

5) Apply the appropriate coordinate transformation Eq. (4.56) to convert (r, V)
from orbit plane coordinates to GCI or HCI.

frame), whereas other types of radar or passive optical observations do not. 
Indeed, classical orbit determination may be thought of as the process of 
determining r and V given angular position (a, 6) observations in an inertial 
frame at known times. 
Classical orbit determination remains important today. Radar observations are 
not possible for all targets and are seldom as accurate on any given measurement 
as are optical sightings. Given adequate observation time and sophisticated 
filtering algorithms (two days of Doppler tracking followed by several hows of 
computer processing are required to provide the ephemeris data, accurate to 
within 10 m at epoch, used in the Navy Transit navigation system), radiometric 
measurement techniques are the method of choice in modem astrodynamics. 
However, for accwate preliminary orbit determination, optical tracking remains 
unsurpassed. This is evident hm the continued use and expansion of such 
systems, as for example in the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space

velocity. 
2) Three line-of-sight vectors (angular measurements) may be known at

4.2.11 Timekeeping Systems

Accurate measurement of time is crucial in astrodynamics. The analytic
results derived from the laws of motion and presented here allow predictions to

ASTRODYNAMICS 133 
* be made for the position of celestial objects at specific past or future times. 
Discrepancies between predictions and observations may, in the absence of 
a priori information, legitimately be attributed either to insufficient fidelity in the 
dynamic model or to inaccuracy in the measurement of time. Obviously, it is 
desirable to reduce uncertainties imposed by timekeeping errors, so that 
differences between measured and predicted motion can be taken as evidence for, 
and a guide to, needed improvements in the theoretical model. 
The concept of time as used here is that of absolute time in the Newtonian or 
nonrelativistic sense. In this model, time flows forward at a uniform rate for all 
observers and provides, along with absolute or inertial space, the kamework in 
which physical events occur. In astrodynamics and celestial mechanics, this 
absolute time is referred to as "ephemeris time," to be discussed later in more detail. 
Special relativity theory shows this concept of time (and space) to be 
fundamentally in error. Perception of time is found to be dependent on the motion 
of the observer, and nonlocal observers are shown to be incapable of agreeing on 
the exact timing of events. General relativity shows further that the measurement 
of time is altered by the gravity field in which such measurements occur. These 
results notwithstanding, relativistic effects are important in astrodynamics only in 
very special cases, and certainly not for the topics of interest in this book. For our 
purposes, Newtonian concepts of absolute space and time are preferable to 
Einsteinian theories of space-time. 
4.2.11.1 Measurement of time. Measurement of absolute time is 
essentially a counting process in which the fundamental counting unit is 
derived from some observable, periodic phenomenon. Many such phenomena 
have been used throughout history as timekeeping standards, always with a 
progression toward the phenomena that demonstrate greater precision in their 
periodicity. In this sense, precision is obtained when the fundamental period is 
relatively insensitive to changes in the physical environment. Thus, pendulum 
clocks allowed a vast improvement in timekeeping standards compared to 
sundials, water clocks, etc. However, the period of a pendulum is a function of the 
local gravitational acceleration, which has a significant variation over the Earth's 
surface. Thus, a timekeepilfg standard based on the pendulum clock is truly valid 
only at one point on Earth. Moreover, the clock must be oriented vertically, and 
hence is useless, even on an approximate basis, for shipboard applications where 
accurate timekeeping is essential to navigation. 
Until 1 January, 1958, the Earth's motion as measured relative to the fixed 
stars formed the basis for timekeeping in physics. By the end of the nineteenth 
century, otherwise unexplainable differences between the observed and predicted 
position of solar system bodies led to the suspicion that the Earth's day and year 
were not of constant length. Although this was not conclusively demonstrated 
until the mid-20th century, the standard or ephemeris second was nonetheless 
taken as 1 /3 1,556,925.9747 of the tropical year (time between successive vernal 
equinoxes) 1900.

hence is useless, even on an approximate basis, for shipboard applications where

Until 1 January, 1958, the Earth’s motion as measured relative to the fixed

until the mid-20th century, the standard or ephemeris second was nonetheless
taken as 1/31,556,925.9747 of the tropical year (time between successive vernal
equinoxes) 1900.

134 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Since 1 January, 1958, the basis for timekeeping has been international atomic 
time (TAI), defined in the international system (SI) of unitsz1 as 9,292,631,770 
periods of the hyperfine transition time for the outer electron of the ~e~~~ atom in 
the ground state. Atomic clocks measure the frequency of the microwave energy 
absorbed or emitted during such transitions and can yield accuracy of better than 
one part in 1014. (For comparison, good quartz crystal oscillators may be stable to 
a few parts in 1013, and good pendulum clocks and commonly available 
wristwatches may be accurate to one part in lo6). The SI second was chosen to 
agree with the previously defined ephemeris second to the precision available in 
the latter as of the transition date. 
4.2.1 1.2 Calendar time. Calendar time, measured in years, months, days, 
hours, minutes, and seconds, is computationally inconvenient but remains kly 
in place as the basis for civil timekeeping in conventional human activities. 
Because spacecraft are launched and controlled according to calendar time, it is 
necessary to relate ephemeris time, based on atomic processes, to calendar time, 
which is forced by human conventions to be synchronous with the Earth's 
rotation. 
The basic unit of convenience in human time measurement is the day, the 
period of time between successive appearances of the sun over a given meridian. 
The mean solar day (as opposed to the apparent solar day) is the average length of 
the day as measured over a year and is employed to remove variations in the day 
due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit and its inclination relative to the sun's 
equator. 
Because "noon" is a local definition, a reference meridian is necessary in 
the specification of a planet-wide timekeeping (and navigation) system. The 
reference meridian, 0" longitude, runs through a particular mark at the former site 
of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. Differences in apparent solar 
time between Greenwich and other locations on Earth basically reflect longitude 
differences between the two points, the principle that is the basis for navigation 
on Earth's surface. Twenty-four local time zones, each nominally.15" longitude 
in width, are defined relative to the prime meridian through Greenwich and are 
employed so that local noon corresponds roughly to the time when the sun is at 
zenith. 0 
The mean solar time at the prime meridian is defined as universal time (UT), 
also called Greenwich mean time (GMT) or Zulu time (Z). A variety of poorly 
understood and essentially unpredictable effects (e.g., variations in the 
accumulation of polar ice from year to year) alter the Earth's rotation period; 
thus, UT does not exactly match any given rotation period, or day. Coordinated 
universal time (UTC) includes these corrections and is the time customarily 
broadcast over the ratio. "Leap seconds" are inserted or deleted from UTC as 
needed to keep it in synchrony with Earth's rotation as measured relative to the 
fixed stars. Past corrections, as well as extrapolations of such corrections into the 
future, are available in standard astronomical tables and almanacs.

which is forced by human conventions to be synchronous with the Earth’s

The mean solar day (as opposed to the apparent solar day) is the average length of
the day as measured over a year and is employed to remove variations in the day
due to the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit and its inclination relative to the sun’s

Because “noon” is a local definition, a reference meridian is necessary in
the specification of a planet-wide timekeeping (and navigation) system. The
reference meridian, 0° longitude, runs through a particular mark at the former site
_ of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. Differences in apparent solar
time between Greenwich and other locations on Earth basically reflect longitude

4.2.11.3 Ephemeris time. From earlier discussions, it is clear that 
ephemeris time is the smoothly flowing, monotonically increasing time measure 
relevant in the analysis of dynamic systems. In contrast, universal time is based 
on average solar position as seen against the stars and thus includes variations due 
to a number of dynamic effects between the sun, Earth, and moon. The resulting 
variation in the length of the day must be accounted for in computing ephemeris 
time from universal time. The required correction is 
where AT is a measured (for the past) or extrapolated (for the future) correction, 
and AT(A) is an approximation to AT given by 
AT(A) = TAI - UT + 32.184 s (4.87) 
Hence, 
where AT = 32.184 s was the correction to UT on 1 January, 1958, the epoch for 
international atomic time. For comparison, AT(A) = 50.54 s was the correction 
for 1 January, 1980. The 18.36-s difference that accumulated between TAI 
(which is merely a running total of SI seconds) and UT from 1958 to 1980 is 
indicative of the corrections required. 
4.2.1 1.4 Julian dates. Because addition and subtraction of calendar time 
units are inconvenient, the use of ephemeris time is universal in astronomy and 
astrodynamics. The origin for ephemeris time is noon on 1 January, 4713 B.C., 
with time measured in days since that epoch. This is the so-called Julian day (JD). 
For example, the Julian day for 31 December, 1984 (also, by definition, 0 
January, 1985) at 0 hrs is 2,446,065.5, and at noon on that day it is 2,446,066. 
Noon on 1 January, 1985, is then JD 2,446,067, etc. Tables of Julian date are 
given in standard astronomical tables and almanacs, as well as in navigation 
handbooks. Fliegel and Van flandernZ2 published a clever and widely 
implemented equation for the determination of any Julian date that is suited 
for use in any computer language (e.g., FORTRAN or .PL/l) with integer- 
truncation arithmetic:

ephemeris time is the smoothly flowing, monotonically increasing time measure
relevant in the analysis of dynamic systems. In contrast, universal time is based
on average solar position as seen against the stars and thus includes variations due
to a number of dynamic effects between the sun, Earth, and moon. The resulting
variation in the length of the day must be accounted for in computing ephemeris
time from universal time. The required correction is

ET = UT + AT ~ UT + AT(A) (4.86)

where AT is a measured (for the past) or extrapolated (for the future) correction,
and AT(A) is an approximation to AT given by

AT(A) = TAI — UT + 32.184 s (4.87)
Hence,
ET ~ TAI + 32.184 s (4.88)

where AT = 32.184 was the correction to UT on 1 January, 1958, the epoch for
international atomic time. For comparison, AT(A) = 50.54 was the correction
for 1 January, 1980. The 18.36-s difference that accumulated between TAI

Noon on 1 January, 1985, is then JD 2,446,067, etc. Tables of Julian date are
given in standard astronomical tables and almanacs, as well as in navigation

The Julian day system has the advantage that practically all times of 
astronomical interest are given in positive units. However, in astrodynamics and 
spacecraft work in general, times prior to 1957 are of little interest, and the large 
positive numbers associated with the basic JD system are somewhat 
cumbersome. Accordingly, the Julian day for space (JDS) system is defined 
with an epoch of 0 hrs UT on 17 September, 1957. Thus, 
JDS = JD - 2,436,099.5 (4.90) 
Similarly, the modified Julian day (JDM) system has an epoch defined at 0 hrs 
UT, 1 January, 1950. These systems have the additional advantage for practical 
spacecraft work of starting at 0 hrs rather than at noon, which is convenient in 
astronomy for avoiding a change in dates during nighttime observations. 
4.2.11.5 Sidereal time. Aside from ephemeris time, the systems 
discussed thus far are all based on the solar day, the interval between 
successive noons or solar zenith appearances. It is this period that is the basic 1 
24-h day. However, because of the motion of the Earth in its orbit, this "day" is 1 
not the true rotational period of the Earth as measured against the stars, a I 
period known as the sidereal day, 23 hrs 56 min 4 s. There is exactly one extra 
sidereal day per year. 
Sidereal time is of no interest for civil timekeeping but is important in 
astronautics for both attitude determination and control and astrodynamics, 
where the orientation of a spacecraft against the stars is considered. For example, I it is the sidereal day that must be used to compute the period for a I 
geosynchronous satellite orbit. Sidereal time is also needed to establish the I

We have, to this point, reviewed the essential aspects of two-body orbital

invalidate Keplerian results. Such influences are always present and can often be 
ignored in preliminary design. However, this is not always the case, nor is it 
indeed always desirable; mission design often involves deliberate use of non- 
Keplerian effects. Examples include the use of atmospheric braking to effect 
orbital maneuvers and the use of the Earth's oblateness to specify desired (often 
sun-synchronous) rates of orbital precession. These and other aspects of non- 
Keplerian orbital dynamics- are discussed in the following sections.

Of the various possible perturbations to basic two-body motion, the most 
obvious are those due to the presence of additional bodies. Such bodies are 
always present and cannot be easily included in an analysis, particularly at 
elementary levels. It is then necessary to determine criteria for the validity of 
Keplerian approximations to real orbits when more than two bodies are present. 
If we consider a spacecraft in transit between two planets, it is clear that when 
close to the departure planet, its orbit is primarily subject to the influence of that 
planet. Far away from any planet, the trajectory is essentially a heliocentric orbit, 
whereas near the arrival planet, the new body will dominate the motion. There 
will clearly be transition regions where two bodies will both have significant 
influence on the spacecraft motion. The location of these transition regions is 
determined by the so-called sphere of influence of each body relative to the other, 
a concept originated by Laplace. 
For any two bodies, such as the sun and a planet, the sphere of influence is 
defined by the locus of points at which the sun's and the planet's gravitational 
fields have equal influence on the spacecraft. The term "sphere of influence" is 
somewhat misleading; every body's gravitational field extends to infinity, and in 
any case, the appropriate equal-influence boundary is not exactly spherical. 
Nonetheless, the concept is a useful one in preliminary design. 
Although the relative regions of primary influence can be readily calculated 
for any two bodies, the concept is most useful when, as mentioned earlier, one of 
the masses is much greater than the other. In such a case, the so-called classical

Lq and 5 are positions of stable equilibrium; objects displaced slightly from

presence of the Trojan asteroids that occupy the stable Lagrange points 60" ahead 
of and behind Jupiter in its orbit about the sun. The properties of Lq and & have

4.3.3 Aspherical Mass Distribution 
As indicated in Sec. 4.2.1 (Two-Body Motion), an extended body such as the 
Earth -acts gravitationally as a point mass provided its mass distribution is 
spherically symmetric. That is, the density function p(r, 8, 4) in spherical 
coordinates must reduce to a function p = AT); there can be no dependence on 
latitude 8 or longitude 4. Actually, the Earth is not spherically symmetric, but 
more closely resembles an oblate spheroid with a polar radius of 6357 krn and an 
equatorial radius of 6378 km. This deformation is due to the angular acceleration 
produced by its spin rate (and is quite severe for the large, mostly gaseous outer 
planets such as Jupiter and Saturn), but numerous higher order variations exist 
and are significant for most Earth orbital missions. 
The Earth is approximately spherically symmetric; thus, it is customary24 to 
describe its gravitational potential in spherical coordinates as a perturbation to the 
basic form of Eq. (4.2), e.g., 
where B(r, 0, 4) is a spherical harmonic expansion in Legendre polynomials 
Pm( cos 8). The complete solution" includes expansion coefficients dependent 
on both latitude and longitude. Both are indeed necessary to represent the 
observable variations in the Earth's field. However, low-orbiting spacecraft 
having short orbital periods are not sensitive to the longitudinal, or tesseral, 
variations because, being periodic, they tend to average to zero. Spacecraft in 
high orbits with periods too slow to justify such an averaging assumption are too 
high to be influenced significantly by what are, after all, very small effects. Thus, 
for the analysis of the most significant orbital perturbations, only the latitude- 
dependent, or zonal, coefficients are important. (An exception is a satellite in a 
geostationary orbit; because it hovers over a particular region on Earth, its orbit is 
subjected to a continual perturbing force in the same direction, which will be 
important.) If the longitude-dependent variations are ignored, the gravitational

4.3.3 Aspherical Mass Distribution

As indicated in Sec. 4.2.1 (Two-Body Motion), an extended body such as the
Earth .acts gravitationally as a point mass provided its mass distribution is
spherically symmetric. That is, the density function p(r, 0, ¢) in spherical
coordinates must reduce to a function p = p(r); there can be no dependence on
latitude @ or longitude ¢. Actually, the Earth is not spherically symmetric, but
more closely resembles an oblate spheroid with a polar radius of 6357 km and an
equatorial radius of 6378 km. This deformation is due to the angular acceleration
produced by its spin rate (and is quite severe for the large, mostly gaseous outer
planets such as Jupiter and Saturn), but numerous higher order variations exist
and are significant for most Earth orbital missions.

The Earth is approximately spherically symmetric; thus, it is customary’ to
describe its gravitational potential in spherical coordinates as a perturbation to the
basic form of Eq. (4.2), e.g.,

U(r, 6, ¢) = -£ + B(r, 6, ) (4.94)

where B(r, 6, $) is a spherical harmonic expansion in Legendre polynomials
Pnm( cos 6). The complete solution”> includes expansion coefficients dependent
on both latitude and longitude. Both are indeed necessary to represent the
observable variations in the Earth’s field. However, low-orbiting spacecraft
having short orbital periods are not sensitive to the longitudinal, or tesseral,
variations because, being periodic, they tend to average to zero. Spacecraft in
high orbits with periods too slow to justify such an averaging assumption are too
high to be influenced significantly by what are, after all, very small effects. Thus,

since (R,/r) < 1, it is to be expected that the second-order term in Eq. (4.95) will

Of interest here is the fact that, for direct (i < 90") orbits, dill& < 0, whereas 
for retrograde orbits it is positive. When the rotation rate equals 360°/yr, the orbit 
is said to be sun-synchronous, because its plane in inertial space will precess to 
remain fixed with respect to the sun. Such orbits are frequently used to allow 
photography or other Earth observations to take place under relatively fixed i 
I viewing and lighting conditions. Practical sun-synchronous orbits are usually 
nearly circular, slightly retrograde (96" < i < 100") and have a mean altitude in 
the range of 200-1000 km. 
From Eq. (4.96) we note that do/& = 0 for sin2 i = 415, or i = 63.435"; thus, 
in this case there is no perturbation to the argument of perigee. For i < 63.435", !

The computed perturbations due to the Earth's oblateness and the higher order 
geopotential variations are most important for relatively low orbits and may not 
be the dominant gravitational disturbances for higher orbits. For example, 
considering only the J2 term in Eq. (4.99, it is easily found that, at 
r -- 15,00Okm, the maximum possible perturbing acceleration is about I 
m/s2. This is comparable to or exceeded by the perturbing acceleration 
produced by the sun on a spacecraft in such an orbit. At higher altitudes, 
oblateness effects are even smaller and may well rank behind lunar perturbations

Of interest here is the fact that, for direct (i < 90°) orbits, d0,/dt < 0, whereas
for retrograde orbits it is positive. When the rotation rate equals 360° /yr, the orbit
is said to be sun-synchronous, because its plane in inertial space will precess to
remain fixed with respect to the sun. Such orbits are frequently used to allow

viewing and lighting conditions. Practical sun-synchronous orbits are usually
nearly circular, slightly retrograde (96° < i < 100°) and have a mean altitude in
the range of 200-1000 km.

From Eq. (4.96) we note that dw/dt = 0 for sin? i = 4/5, or i = 63.435°; thus,
in this case there is no perturbation to the argument of perigee. For i < 63.435°,
the rotation of the line of apsides is in the direction of the orbit, whereas for larger
inclinations, it rotates in the direction opposite to the motion.

The computed perturbations due to the Earth’s oblateness and the higher order
geopotential variations are most important for relatively low orbits and may not
be the dominant gravitational disturbances for higher orbits. For example,
considering only the J, term in Eq. (4.95), it is. easily found that, at
r~15,000km, the maximum possible perturbing acceleration is about
10-3 m/s. This is comparable to or exceeded by the perturbing acceleration
produced by the sun on a spacecraft in such an orbit. At higher altitudes,
oblateness effects are even smaller and may well rank behind lunar perturbations
(typically two orders of magnitude smaller than solar effects) in significance. The
exception, again, can be satellites in geostationary orbits, which are subject to
essentially constant perturbing forces due to geopotential variations.

The results of this section are of course not restricted to Earth-orbiting
spacecraft and can be used to establish orbits with particular characteristics about
other planets. Duting the Viking missions to Mars, for example, the Viking
orbiters were inserted into highly elliptic orbits with a periapsis of a few hundred

optimize data relay from the landers. However, this orbit minimized fuel usage
during the injection maneuver, allowed both high- and Jow-altitude photography,
and, because of the rotation of the line of apsides,-allowed the periapsis to occur
over a substantial range of latitudes. This allowed most of the planet to be
photographed at both small and large scale.

The results presented in this section may be used in reverse order; that is,
orbital tracking may be used to establish the values of the J,, coefficients (and, in
the full-blown expansion, the values of the tesseral harmonic coefficients as
well).”* Tracking of the early Vanguard satellites was used to establish the pear-
shaped nature of the Earth’s figure, shown by the fact that J3 is nonzero. Today
satellite geodesy is the method that produces the most accurate determination of

it can be desired to measure. Great care is required to develop analytical models 
for these effects so that the biases they introduce can be removed from the data. 
The problem can also be circumvented by the use of an onboard drag- 
compensation system. The system operates by enclosing a small free-floating 
proof mass inside the spacecraft (see Fig. 4.1 1). The proof mass is maintained in a 
fixed position relative to the spacecraft body by means of very small thrusters 
operating in a closed-loop control system?7 This drag-compensation system 
removes all nongravitational forces on the proof mass, and hence the spacecraft, 
and thus forces it to follow a purely gravitational trajectory. The measured 
departures from simple Keplerian motion are then due to perturbations in the 
Earth's potential field. 
This approach has advantages for navigation satellites as well as for geodetic 
research. First implemented in the U.S. Navy TRIAD program in 1972, the drag- 
free [also called Disturbance Compensation System (DISCOS)] concept27 has 
allowed the measurement of along-track gravitational perturbations down to a 
level of 5 x 10-12g. Its use has been proposed for other applications where 
removal of all nongravitational effects is important. 
In recent years the constellation of some two dozen GPS satellites (see also 
Chapter 11) has been used to refine the geodetic model?' The relatively high 
orbit of the constellation makes it difficult to detect the higher order field 
harmonics; however, this is compensated by the advantages that result from 
having numerous satellites in stable orbits available to be tracked for decades. 
Proposals have been advanced for placing two spacecraft in the same relatively 
low orbit and using their differential acceleration as an even more sensitive 
indicator of variations in the Earth's figure29 (see Table 4.2). 
The standard model for Earth geodesy for many years was She World Geodetic 
System 1984 (WGS-84) model, which provides expansion coefficients for Eq. 
(4.94) up to n = m = 180. A newer version, Earth Gravity Model 1996 (EGM- 
96) provides coefficient data through n = m = 360. These models are maintained 
by the U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and may be 
downloaded from the NIMA website.

removes all nongravitational forces on the proof mass, and hence the spacecraft,
and thus forces it to follow a purely gravitational trajectory. The measured
departures from simple Keplerian motion are then due to perturbations in the
Earth’s potential field.

This approach has advantages for navigation satellites as well as for geodetic
research. First implemented in the U.S. Navy TRIAD program in 1972, the drag-
free [also called Disturbance Compensation System (DISCOS)] concept” has
allowed the measurement of along-track gravitational perturbations down to a
level of 5 x 107!2g. Its use has been proposed for other applications where
removal of all nongravitational effects is important.

In recent years the constellation of some two dozen GPS satellites (see also
Chapter 11) has been used to refine the geodetic model.”* The relatively high
orbit of the constellation makes it difficult to detect the higher order field
harmonics; however, this is compensated by the advantages that result from
having numerous satellites in stable orbits available to be tracked for decades.
Proposals have been advanced for placing two spacecraft in the same relatively
low orbit and using their differential acceleration as an even more sensitive
indicator of variations in the Earth’s figure” (see Table 4.2).

The standard model for Earth geodesy for many years was the World Geodetic
System 1984 (WGS-84) model, which provides expansion coefficients for Eq.
(4.94) up to n = m= 180. A newer version, Earth Gravity Model 1996 (EGM-
96) provides coefficient data through n = m = 360. These models are maintained
by the U.S. National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and may be

The use of the potential function expansion approach relies for its 
computational practicality on the assumption that the Earth is nearly spherical 
and that its potential may be approximated by small perturbations to the simple 
point-mass fonn. For the Earth this is true, but this is not always so elsewhere in 
the solar system. The moon is both substantially ellipsoidal and possessed of 
regions of significant mass concentration, or mascons, discovered during the 
Apollo era by tracking lunar orbiting spacecraft. In such cases, the oblateness 
tenn may not be the most significant source of orbital perturbations.

The influence of atmospheric drag is important for all spacecraft in low Earth 
orbit, both for attitude control (see Chapter 7) and in astrodynamics. Such 
spacecraft will eventually reenter the atmosphere due to the cumulative effect of 
atmospheric drag unless provided with an onboard propulsion system for periodic 
reboost. The period of time required for this to occur is called the orbital lifetime 
of the spacecraft, and depends on the mass and aerodynamic properties of the 
vehicle, its orbital altitude and eccentricity, and the density of the atmosphere. 
An example of the effect of atmospheric drag on a spacecraft in low Earth orbit 
is given in Fig. 4.12, which shows the predicted decay for the Space Shuttle as a 
function of orbital height and vehicle attitude.30 
Because of the difficulty of modeling both the environmental and spacecraft 
aerodynamic properties in this flight regime, quantitative results for orbital 
perturbations due to atmospheric drag are difficult to obtain. In the following 
sections we discuss the approximate results that can be obtained and supply 
guidelines for more detailed modeling effects where appropriate. 
4.3.4.1 Atmosphere models. As will be seen, satellite orbital lifetime 
depends strongly on the variation of the upper atmosphere density with altitude. 
Although the gross behavior of the atmospheric density is well established, exact 
properties are difficult to determine and highly variable. It is this factor, more 
than any other, which makes the determination of satellite lifetimes so uncertain, 
and renders even the most sophisticated analysis of more academic than practical 
interest. "Permanent" satellites will have lifetimes measured in years, with an 
uncertainty measured at least in months and quite possibly also in years. 
As a spacecraft approaches reentry, this uncertainty decreases; however, 
predicted lifetimes may be in error by one or more orbital periods even on the day 
of reentry. Errors of about 10% of the remaining lifetime represent the best 
obtainable precision for orbit decay analyses. Difficulties in orbital decay 
analysis were graphically illustrated during the final months and days prior to the 
reentry of Skylab in 1979, and again for Mir in 2001. Kaplan et a~.~' present an 
excellent summary of the analytical and operational effort expended in a largely 
unsuccessful attempt to effect a controlled reentry of the Skylab vehicle.

with a mean value of about 7.1 km. In the worst case, when 1/P = Skm, 
examination of temperature profile data for Earth indicates that the gravitational 
term is approximately 0.14 km- ' and the temperature gradient term is 
approximately 0.04 krn- '. However, for the relatively small range of altitudes 
of importance in satellite aerodynamic drag analyses, it is often acceptable to 
assume p to be a constant given by its mean value in the range of interest. 
Shanklin et aL3' studied the sensitivity of near-term orbit ephemeris predictions 
to differences among various atmosphere models and concluded that the simple 
exponential model discussed earlier yielded, for the four cases studied, results 
indistinguishable from those using more complex models. 
Standard atmosphere data are presented in Figs. 3.21 and 3.22 and Appendix 
B. 17. Extensive variations from average atmosphere properties exist. 
Fluctuations are observed on a daily, 27-day, seasonal, yearly, and 11-yr basis, 
as well as with latitude. Of these, the 1 1 -year cycle is the most pronounced, due to 
the variations in solar flux with the sunspot cycle. Density fluctuations of a factor 
of 10 at 350 km and a factor of 5 at 800 km are observed. 
Higher solar flux produces greater atmospheric density at a given altitude. 
Solar flux is commonly reported in units of lo4 Janskys (1 Jansky = 
W . m-2 - Hz-'), with typical 1 1-yr minima of 80 and maxima of 150, 
with peaks of 250 not unrealistic. ~acchia~~ shows the effects of such peaks. For 
example, at 500 km with a solar flux of 125, a nominal density of 1.25 x 
10-12kg/m3 is observed, whereas a solar flux of 160 will produce the same 
density at 600 km. 
4.3.4.2 Effects of drag on orbital parameters. Drag is defined as the 
component of force antiparallel to the spacecraft velocity vector relative to the 
atmosphere. We may often ignore the velocity component due to the rotation of 
the atmosphere, because it is small compared to the spacecraft orbital velocity. 
There is then no component of force normal to the orbit plane, and, to a first 
approximation, atmospheric drag thus has no effect on the elements o, a, and i, 
which determine the orientation of the orbit in space. 
As discussed earlier, atmospheric density varies exponentially with height 
above the Earth, with a scale height on the order of tens of kilometers, and is 
always small at orbital altitudes. Thus, if the orbit is even slightly elliptic, the 
principal drag occurs at perigee and may be modeled approximately as an 
impulsive reduction in velocity. It will be seen in Section 4.4 that the result of 
such an impulsive AV maneuver is to reduce the orbital apogee while leaving the 
perigee altitude essentially unchanged. Thus, atmospheric drag reduces the 
semimajor axis and the eccentricity of the orbit, tending to circularize it. A low 
orbit that is nearly circular experiences a significant continuing drag force and 
may have a lifetime of only days or hours. 
This model is of course only approximate, and aerodynamic drag does cause 
. variations in all orbital elements.37 However, more detailed analysis does confirm 
the principal features of this model, namely, that drag tends to circularize the 
orbit at an altitude very near that of the original perigee. Analysis of the motion of

The term (m/SCD) in Eq. (4.107) is the ballistic coefficient and is a measure of 
the ability of an object to overcome fluid resistance (see also Chapter 6). Typical 
values for spacecraft will be on the order of 10-100 kg/m2. The projected area 
can be complicated to compute for other than simple spacecraft shapes, but this 
presents no fundamental difficulties. Determination of the drag coefficient is 
more complex. This issue is addressed subsequently. 
If only the time to circularize the orbit is required, then Eq. (4.105) or (4.106) 
alone is sufficient, and the more complex procedure for analyzing the evolution of 
the orbit due to drag is unnecqssary. This is often the case in preliminary design 
work. 
4.3.4.4 Circular orbit lifetime. The lifetime remaining for a circular orbit 
is easily estimated from first principles. Orbital energy is dissipated by drag, and 
since the semi-major axis a is solely a function of the orbital energy, it will 
gradually decay. The rate at which orbital energy is lost must be matched by the 
power (force multiplied by velocity) dissipated by the satellite due to 
aerodynamic drag. Thus, from Eqs. (4.16) and (4.108),

The term (m/SCp) in Eq. (4.107) is the ballistic coefficient and is a measure of
the ability of an object to overcome fluid resistance (see also Chapter 6). Typical
values for spacecraft will be on the order of 10-100 kg/m7. The projected area
can be complicated to compute for other than simple spacecraft shapes, but this
presents no fundamental difficulties. Determination of the drag coefficient is
more complex. This issue is addressed subsequently.

If only the time to circularize the orbit is required, then Eq. (4.105) or (4.106)
alone is sufficient, and the more complex procedure for analyzing the evolution of
the orbit due to drag is unnecessary. This is often the case in preliminary design
work.

4.3.4.4 Circular orbit lifetime. The lifetime remaining for a circular orbit
is easily estimated from first principles. Orbital energy is dissipated by drag, and
since the semi-major axis a is solely a function of the orbital energy, it will
gradually decay. The rate at which orbital energy is lost must be matched by the
power (force multiplied by velocity) dissipated by the satellite due to
aerodynamic drag. Thus, from Eqs. (4.16) and (4.108),

4.3.4.5 Drag coefficient. As seen, the orbit lifetime depends directly on 
CD. For analysis of orbit decay, we are concerned with the so-called free 
molecular flow regime. In this regime, the flow loses its continuum nature and 
appears to a first approximation as a stream of independent particles (i.e., 
Knudsen number %- ao 1). Furthermore, the flow is at very high speed, about Mach 
25 or more than 7.5 km/s in most cases, and thus is hypersonic. This implies that 
any pressure forces produced by random thermal motion are small in comparison 
to those due to the directed motion of the spacecraft through the upper 
atmosphere. 
The high-speed, rarefied flow regime permits the use of Newtonian flow 
theory, in which the component of momentum flux nonnal to a body is assumed 
to be transferred to the body by means of elastic collisions with the gas 
molecules. The tangential component is assumed unchanged. The net momentum 
flux normal to the body surface produces a pressure force that, when integrated 
over the body, yields the drag on the body. Geometric shadowing of the flow is 
assumed, which implies that only the projected area of the spacecraft can 
contribute to the drag force. Subject to these assumptions, and assuming Mach

required integrations can be performed analytically, yielding ,useful results for 
preliminary design and analysis. Table 4.3 gives values of CD for spheres, 
cylinders, flat plates, and cones subject to the preceding assumptions.

the pressure coefficient over the known body contour. For simple shapes the
required integrations can be performed analytically, yielding useful results for
preliminary design and analysis. Table 4.3 gives values of Cp for spheres,

Newtonian flow theory allows only approximate results at best. Even at the

pressure does not act on a spacecraft during periods of solar occultation by the 
Earth or other bodies. 
The perturbing effects of solar radiation pressure can be deliberately enhanced 
by building a spacecraft with a large area-to-mass ratio. This is the so-called solar 
sail concept. If the center of mass of the vehicle is maintained near to or in the 
plane of the sail to minimize "weathervane" or "parachute" tendencies, then the 
sail can provide significant propulsive force nod to the sun vector, allowing 
relatively sophisticated orbital maneuvers. Solar sails have been proposed by 
many authors for use in planetary exploration.46 The solar sail concept enables

orbit adjustments during the mission. In other cases, nominal launch vehicle 
insertion accuracies are inadequate, or the desired final orbit cannot be achieved 
with only a single boost phase, and postinjection orbital maneuvers will be 
required. Still other missions will involve frequent orbit adjustments to fulfill 
basic objectives. In this section, we consider simple orbital maneuvers including 
plane changes, one- and two-impulse transfers, and combined maneuvers. 
In the following we assume impulsive transfers, i.e., the maneuver occurs in a 
time interval that is short with respect to the orbital period. Because orbit 
adjustment maneuvers typically consume a few minutes at most and orbital 
periods are 100 min or longer, this is generally a valid approximation. In such 
cases, the total impulse (change in momentum) per unit mass is simply equal to 
the change in velocity AV. 
This quantity is the appropriate measure of maneuvering capability for 
spacecraft that typically are fuel limited. To see this, note that, if a thruster 
produces a constant force F on a spacecraft with mass in for time interval At, we 
obtain upon integrating Newton's second law 
Since F/m will be essentially constant during small maneuvers, and since the 
total thruster on-time is limited by available fuel, the total AV available for 
spacecraft maneuvers is tixed and is a measure of vehicle maneuver performance 
capability. 
4.4.1 Plane Changes 
Most missions, in cases where any orbit adjustment at all is required, will 
require some adjustment of the orbital plane. This plane (see Fig. 4.13) is 
perpendicular to the angular momentum vector h, which for a Keplerian orbit is 
permanently fixed in space. A pure plane rotation alters h in direction but not in 
magnitude and thus requires an applied torque normal to h. This in turn requires 
the application of a force on the spacecraft, e.g., a thruster firing, parallel to h. For 
pure plane rotation we see from the geometry of Fig. 4.1 3 and the law of cosines 
that the change in angular momentum is related to the rotation angle v by 
and since h = rVe, the required &npulse is 
where the last equality is valid for small v.

Since F/m will be essentially constant during small maneuvers, and since the
total thruster on-time is limited by available fuel, the total AV available for
spacecraft maneuvers is fixed and is a measure of vehicle maneuver performance
capability.

Most missions, in cases where any orbit adjustment at all is required, will
require some adjustment of the orbital plane. This plane (see Fig. 4.13) is
perpendicular to the angular momentum vector h, which for a Keplerian orbit is
permanently fixed in space. A pure plane rotation alters /: in direction but not in
magnitude and thus requires an applied torque normal to h. This in turn requires
the application of a force on the spacecraft, e.g., a thruster firing, parallel to h. For
pure plane rotation we see from the geometry of Fig. 4.13 and the law of cosines
that the change in angular momentum is related to the rotation angle v by

Ah = h{2(1 — cos vy]? = 2hsin(5) (4.123)
and since h = rg, the required impulse is

AV = 2V, sin(>) ~ Vop (4.124)

where the last equality is valid for small v.
This impulse is applied perpendicular to the initial orbit plane. There results a
node line between the initial and final orbits running through the point where the

determined by mission requirements, the timing of the maneuver is often fixed. 
Maximum spatial separation between the initial and final orbits occurs + 90"

Note that, if the impulse is applied at the line of nodes of the original orbit (i.e., 
in the equatorial plane of the coordinate system in use), then the plane rotation 
will result in a change of orbital inclination only, with Ai = v. If the impulse is 
applied at o + 8 = 90°, i-e., at a point in the orbit where the radius vector is 
perpendicular to the line of nodes, the orbit will precess by the amount ALI = v

In practice, adjustments for both i and fi may be required. Adjustments to 0

existing planetary configuration). Alterations to inclination angle are required to 
compensate for azimuthal heading (see Sec. 4.2.8) errors at injection. 
Adjustments to fi and i can be done separately, but the typical maneuver is a 
single plane rotation executed at the node line between the initial and desired 
orbits. Figure 4.14 shows the spherical triangle that is applicable to this case.

Two locations in true anomaly A are possible, corresponding to the choice of + v
at the two nodes. To minimize AV requirements, the maneuver should be
executed at the node with the largest radius vector.

Interestingly, a plane rotation executed with a single impulsive burn at the line
of nodes is not always a minimum-energy maneuver. Lang*® shows that if the
desired node line and the orbital eccentricity are such that

Differences between the one- and two-impulse transfers can be significant if 
eccentricity is large. Lang shows that, for e = 0.7 and o* = 90 or 27O0, a 29% 
savings is realized using the optimal maneuver. For e < 0.1, savings are always 
less than 10%. 
Equation (4.124) shows that plane changes are expensive; a 0.1-rad rotation 
for a 200-lan circular parking orbit requires a AV of approximately 0.78 km/s.

maneuvers in the upper atmosphere to effect plane  rotation^?^ Such possibilities 
are clearly enhanced for vehicles such as the space shuttle, which have a 
significant lift vector that can be rotated out of the plane of the atmospheric entry 
trajectory. 
Mission requirements specifying node location may well be in conflict with 
the desire to minimize fuel expenditure. It may be noted that AV requirements are 
minimized by executing the maneuver when Ve is smallest, i.e., at the apoapsis of 
an elliptic orbit. Unless the required node line location coincides with the line of 
apsides of the initial orbit, this minimum-impulse maneuver cannot be achieved. 
A simple example is found in the deployment of a communications satellite 
into a geostationary, hence equatorial, orbit. As seen in Sec. 4.2.8, the minimum 
inclination orbit for launch from Cape Canaveral is 28.5". The satellite will either 
be injected directly into a highly elliptic transfer orbit with apoapsis at 
geostationary altitude, or into a nearly circular parking orbit and then later into 
the transfer orbit. Plane rotation must be done over the equator, and it is highly 
desirable that it be done at apogee. Thus, the initial launch (or the maneuver into 
the transfer orbit) must be timed to cause the apogee to be so placed. This is most 
easily accomplished from a circular parking orbit, which is one reason why initial 
injection into such an orbit is typically a part of more complex mission sequences. 
I However, such freedom is not always available. Interplanetary missions 
provide a ready example. Although most of the planets lie close to the plane of 
Earth's orbit (ecliptic plane), none is exactly in it; and hence, heliocentric orbit 
1 plane changes are always required for interplanetary transfer, unless the mission 
i can be timed to allow the target planet to be intercepted when it is at its 
heliocentric line of nodes (i.e., in the ecliptic plane). This is not often the case. 
As will be seen in Sec. 4.5, a spacecraft on an outer planetary mission will at 
the time of intercept be at, or at least closer to, the transfer orbit apoapsis than it 
I was at departure from the Earth. As discussed, this is the more desirable position 
for a plane change. However, since the plane rotation maneuver must occur 90"

Mission requirements specifying node location may well be in conflict with
the desire to minimize fuel expenditure. It may be noted that AV requirements are

However, such freedom is not always available. Interplanetary missions
provide a ready example. Although most of the planets lie close to the plane of
Earth’s orbit (ecliptic plane), none is exactly in it; and hence, heliocentric orbit
plane changes are always required for interplanetary transfer, unless the mission
can be timed to allow the target planet to be intercepted when it is at its
heliocentric line of nodes (i.e., in the ecliptic plane). This is not often the case.

As will be seen in Sec. 4.5, a spacecraft on an outer planetary mission will at
the time of intercept be at, or at least closer to, the transfer orbit apoapsis than it
was at departure from the Earth. As discussed, this is the more desirable position
for a plane change. However, since the plane rotation maneuver must occur 90°
prior to intercept (if maximum effect is to be gained from the maneuver), the node
line is thus specified and will not be at the optimal aphelion point. The magnitude

The plane change may be done closer to the target planet than the optimal 
point 90" prior to encounter. In such a case, a larger rotation angle is required

maximum effect. It may be necessary to balance this loss against a gain due to 
performing the maneuver farther from the sun, where the tangential velocity Ve is

We now consider maneuvers that leave the orientation of the orbit unchanged

either case, the maneuver satisfies the vector equation 
However, for preliminary calculations it may be more convenient to use the law 
of cosines with the velocity vector diagram of Fig. 4.16 to determine the required 
information. 
In case 1, where the new orbit is known and the transfer point (rl, el) is 
specified, V2 is immediately found from Eq. (4.17), and y2 is found from 
Eq. (4.60). Then the impulse and heading are

In case 2, the new orbit is to be found given 4 or y~". With 4 computed from 
Eq. (4.134) if need be, Eq. (4.132) is used to solve for V2, and then Eq. (4.133) is 
used to find y2. The results of Sec. 4.2.8 (Orbital Elements from Position and 
Velocity) are then applied to find h, p, e, a, 8, and w. 
The most important special case for a single-impulse transfer occurs when the 
maneuver AV is applied tangent to the existing velocity vector V1. Then 4 = 0 or 
n, and Eq. (4.132) yields V2 = V1 , AV. The tangential AV application thus 
allows the maximum possible change in orbital energy for a given fuel 
expenditure, adding to or subtracting from the existing velocity in a scalar 
fashion. Moreover, from Eq. (4.13 I), y2 = yl ; hence, the flight-path angle is not 
altered at the point of maneuver execution. 
At apogee or perigee, V, = 0, Ve = VI, and y, = 0. A tangentially applied 
impulse alters only Ve, leaving V,. = 0, and does not change the perigee or apogee 
radius. Because angular momentum is conserved, 
an increase or decrease in V, with rp constant must result in an increase or 
decrease in r,. Thus, a tangential maneuver at one of the apsides takes effect at 
the opposite apsis. Because y is not altered at the maneuver point, the line of 
apsides does not rotate. An example is shown in Fig. 4.17, which illustrates an

it may be specified by the flight-path angle y,, relative to the local horizontal. In
either case, the maneuver satisfies the vector equation

V,=V,+AV (4.130)

However, for preliminary calculations it may be more convenient to use the law
of cosines with the velocity vector diagram of Fig. 4.16 to determine the required
information.

In case 1, where the new orbit is known and the transfer point (r;, ,) is
specified, V2 is immediately found from Eq. (4.17), and y, is found from
Eq. (4.60). Then the impulse and heading are

In case 2, the new orbit is to be found given ¢ or yay. With @ computed from
Eq. (4.134) if need be, Eg. (4.132) is used to solve for V2, and then Eq. (4.133) is
used to find y,. The results of Sec. 4.2.8 (Orbital Elements from Position and
Velocity) are then applied to find h, p, e, a, 0, and w.

The most important special case for a single-impulse transfer occurs when the
maneuver AV is applied tangent to the existing velocity vector V,. Then ¢ = 0 or
a, and Eq. (4.132) yields V2 = V,; + AV. The tangential AV application thus
allows the maximum possible change in orbital energy for a given fuel
expenditure, adding to or subtracting from the existing velocity in a scalar
fashion. Moreover, from Eq. (4.131), y. = y,; hence, the flight-path angle is not
altered at the point of maneuver execution.

At apogee or perigee, V. = 0, Ve = Vi, and y, =0. A tangentially applied
impulse alters only Vg, leaving V, = 0, and does not change the perigee or apogee
radius, Because angular momentum is conserved,

h=rVo = raha = TV, (4.135)

an increase or decrease in V, with r, constant must result in an increase or
decrease in rz. Thus, a tangential maneuver at one of the apsides takes effect at
the opposite apsis. Because y is not altered at the maneuver point, the line of
apsides does not rotate. An example is shown in Fig. 4.17, which illustrates an

4.4.3 Combined Maneuvers 
It is often possible to combine a required in-plane and out-of-plane maneuver 
and effect a fuel savings. A practical example is that of the previous section, in 
which the AV requirement for a Hohmann transfer from a parking orbit to 
geosynchronous orbit was computed. To attain a geostationary orbit, a plane 
change of 28.5" (assuming a due-east launch from Cape Canaveral) is required. 
The situation is as shown in Fig. 4.19. As in previous sections, V1 is the 
existing velocity vector, V2 is the desired vector, and 
gives the magnitude of the velocity increment required for the transfer to effect 
the combined plane change and alteration of the in-plane elements a, e, and o. 
In the preceding example, Vl = 1.596kmls, V2 = 3.075 km/s, and Ai = 28.5 
deg; thus we find AV = 1.838 lads. If the maneuvers are performed separately, 
with the plane change first, Eq. (4.1 18) yields AVl = 0.786km/s, and the 
circularization maneuver requires AV2 = 1.479 km/s, as before. This produces a 
total mission AV = 2.265 km/s, clearly a less efficient approach. 
More general combinations of maneuvers are possible that have concomitant

4.4.3 Combined Maneuvers

It is often possible to combine a required in-plane and out-of-plane maneuver
and effect a fuel savings. A practical example is that of the previous section, in
which the AV requirement for a Hohmann transfer from a parking orbit to
geosynchronous orbit was computed. To attain a geostationary orbit, a plane
change of 28.5° (assuming a due-east launch from Cape Canaveral) is required.

The situation is as shown in Fig. 4.19. As in previous sections, V, is the
existing velocity vector, V2 is the desired vector, and

AV = V? + V3 —2V,V2 cos Ai (4.144)

gives the magnitude of the velocity increment required for the transfer to effect
the combined plane change and alteration of the in-plane elements a, e, and w.

In the preceding example, V; = 1.596km/s, V2 = 3.075 km/s, and Ai = 28.5
deg; thus we find AV = 1.838 km/s. If the maneuvers are performed separately,
with the plane change first, Eq. (4.118) yields AV, = 0.786km/s, and the
circularization maneuver requires AV2 = 1.479 km/s, as before. This produces a
total mission AV = 2.265 km/s, clearly a less efficient approach.

More general combinations of maneuvers are possible that have concomitant
fuel savings over sequential AV applications. Investigation of optimal orbit
transfers is a perennial topic of research in astrodynamics. Small>* and Hulkower

but also, without a preliminary analytical solution, they offer no way to eliminate 
the many cases that are not at all close to the actual solution of interest. 
For initial mission design and feasibility assessments, the so-called method of 
patched conics is universally employed. We consider the application of the 
method in some detail. 
4.5.1 Method of Patched Conics I 
As the name implies, this approach uses a series of Keplerian orbits to define 
the trajectory. Each separate conic section is assumed to be solely due to the 
influence of the dominant body for that portion of the mission. The different 
segments are "patched" at the sphere of influence boundaries between different 
bodies given by Eq. (4.93). Thus, a spacecraft trajectory between Earth and Mars 
will be modeled for departures as a geocentric escape hyperbola, which at great 
distances from Earth becomes a heliocentric elliptic orbit, followed again by a 
hyperbolic approach to Mars under the influence of that planet's gravitational 
field. 
Patched-conic trajectory designs are accomplished in three well-defined steps: 
1) The heliocentric orbit from the departure planet to the target planet is 
computed, ignoring the planet at either end of the arc. 
2) A hyperbolic orbit at the departure planet is computed to provide the 
"infinity" (sphere of influence boundary) conditions required for the departure 
end of the heliocentric orbit in step 1. 
3) A hyperbolic approach to the target is computed from the infinity conditions 
specified by the heliocentric orbit arrival. 
The statement of the patched-conic procedure shows that it cannot yield truly 
accurate results. A spacecraft in an interplanetary trajectory is always under the 
influence of more than one body, and especially so near the sphere of influence 
boundaries. Transitions from one region of dominance to another are gradual and 
do not occur at sharply defined boun'daries. Keplerian orbit assumptions in these 
regions are incorrect, yet conveniently applicable analytical results do not exist, 
even for the restricted three-body problem. Other perturbations, such as solar 
radiation pressure, also occur and can have significant long-term effects. 
The patched-conic method yields good estimates of mission AV requirements 
and thus allows quick feasibility assessments. Flight times are less well predicted, 
being in error by hours, days, or even weeks for lengthy interplanetary missions. 
Such errors are of no consequence for preliminary mission design but are 
unacceptable for mission execution. An encounter at the target planet must occur 
within seconds of the predicted time if a flyby or orbit injection maneuver is to be 
properly performed. For example, the heliocentric velocity of Mars in its orbit is 
roughly 24 km/s. If an orbit injection were planned to occur at a 500 Ian periapsis 
height, a spacecraft arriving even 10 s late at Mars would likely enter the 
atmosphere.

the many cases that are not at all close to the actual solution of interest.

For initial mission design and feasibility assessments, the so-called method of
patched conics is universally employed. We consider the application of the
method in some detail.

4.5.1 Method of Patched Conics

As the name implies, this approach uses a series of Keplerian orbits to define
the trajectory. Each separate conic section is assumed to be solely due to the
influence of the dominant body for that portion of the mission. The different
segments are “patched” at the sphere of influence boundaries. between different
bodies given by Eq. (4.93). Thus, a spacecraft trajectory between Earth and Mars
will be modeled for departures as a geocentric escape hyperbola, which at great
distances from Earth becomes a heliocentric elliptic orbit, followed again by a
hyperbolic approach to Mars under the influence of that planet’s gravitational
field.

Patched-conic trajectory designs are accomplished in three well-defined steps:

1) The heliocentric orbit from the departure planet to the target planet is
computed, ignoring the planet at either end of the arc.

2) A hyperbolic orbit at the departure planet is computed to provide the
“infinity” (sphere of influence boundary) conditions required for the departure
end of the heliocentric orbit in step 1.

3) A hyperbolic approach to the target is computed from the infinity conditions
specified by the heliocentric orbit arrival.

The statement of the patched-conic procedure shows that it cannot yield truly
accurate results. A spacecraft in an interplanetary trajectory is always under the
influence of more than one body, and especially so near the sphere of influence
boundaries. Transitions from one region of dominance to another are gradual and
do not occur at sharply defined boundaries. Keplerian orbit assumptions in these
regions are incorrect, yet conveniently applicable analytical results do not exist,
even for the restricted three-body problem. Other perturbations, such as solar
radiation pressure, also occur and can have significant long-term effects.

The patched-conic method yields good estimates of mission AV requirements
and thus allows quick feasibility assessments. Flight times are less well predicted,
being in error by hours, days, or even weeks for lengthy interplanetary missions.
Such errors are of no consequence for preliminary mission design but are
unacceptable for mission execution. An encounter at the target planet must occur
within seconds of the predicted time if a flyby or orbit injection maneuver is to be
properly performed. For example, the heliocentric velocity of Mars in its orbit is
roughly 24 km/s. If an orbit injection were planned to occur at a 500 km periapsis
height, a spacecraft arriving even 10s late at Mars would likely enter the
atmosphere.

ASTRODYNAMICS 169 
Patched-chic techniques are useful at the preliminary design level for hand 
calculation or for implementation in a relatively simple computer program. As 
stated, actual mission design and execution must employ the most accurate 
possible numerical integration techniques. The differencein accuracy obtainable 
from these two approaches can be a source of di£ficulty, even at the preliminary 
design level, for modem interplanetary missions involving application of 
multiple AV or planetary flybys and the imposition of targeting constraints and 
limitations on total maneuver AV. In such cases, the errors implicit in patched- 
conic approximations during early phases of the trajectory may invalidate 
subsequent results, and detailed numerical calculations are too cumbersome even 
on the fastest machines for use in preliminary analysis. Recent applications of 
constrained parameter optimization theory to the multiple encounter problem 
have resulted in relatively fast, efficient techniques for trajectory design that 
eliminate 90-99% of the error of simple conic methods.50 
4.5.1.1 Heliocentric trajectory. This portion of the interplanetary 
transfer will usually be computed first, unless certain specific conditions 
required at an encounter with the target planet should require a particular value of 
V, for the hyperbolic approach. As stated earlier, the calculation ignores the 
planet at each end of the transfer and thus gives the AV to go from the orbit of the 
departure planet to the orbit of the arrival planet. To be strictly correct, the 
departure and arrival should begin and end at the sphere of influence boundary for 
each planet; however, these regions are typically quite small with respect to the 
dimensions of the heliocentric transfer and are often ignored. Of course, 
calculations for Earth-moon missions cannot justifiably employ this assumption. 
The heliocentric segment is not restricted to Hohmann transfers or even to 
coplanar transfers, though these are common assumptions in preliminary design. 
The assumption of coplanarity may cause serious errors in AV computations and 
should be avoided. However, given the overall accuracy of the method, the 
assumption of circular orbits at the departure and amval planets is often 
reasonable and because of its convenience is used where possible. This 
assumption may not be justified for missions to planets with substantially elliptic 
orbits, e.g., Mercury or possibly Mars or, in the extreme case, Pluto. 
The heliocentric trajectory design will usually be constrained by available 
launch energy, desired travel time, or both. When both are important, appropriate 
tradeoffs must be made, with the realization, however, that energy savings 
achieved through the use of near-Hohmann trajectories can be nullified-by the 
increased mass and/or redundant systems required because of the longer flight 
times. Again, minimum-energy orbits (Hohmann-type doubly tangent transfer 
plus a heliocentric plane change if required) are often assumed initially because 
of the computational convenience. If the flight times are unacceptable, a faster 
transfer must be used, with consequently higher AV requirements. 
If a doubly tangent transfer orbit is assumed, then Eqs. (4.140-4.143) may be 
used to determine the transfer orbit characteristics. Equation (4.124) is used to

4.5.1.1 Heliocentric trajectory. This portion of the interplanetary
transfer will usually be computed first, unless certain specific conditions
required at an encounter with the target planet should require a particular value of
Voo for the hyperbolic approach. As stated earlier, the calculation ignores the
planet at each end of the transfer and thus gives the AV to go from the orbit of the
departure planet to the orbit of the arrival planet. To be strictly correct, the
departure and arrival should begin and end at the sphere of influence boundary for
each planet; however, these regions are typically quite small with respect to the
dimensions of the heliocentric transfer and are often ignored. Of course,
calculations for Earth-moon missions cannot justifiably employ this assumption.

The heliocentric segment is not restricted to Hohmann transfers or even to
coplanar transfers, though these are common assumptions in preliminary design.
The assumption of coplanarity may cause serious errors in AV computations and
should be avoided. However, given the overall accuracy of the method, the
assumption of circular orbits at the departure and arrival planets is often

plus a heliocentric plane change if required) are often assumed initially because

It will always be advantageous for the transfer orbit to be tangent to that of the

for any conic orbit. If the departure or arrival planet orbit is circular, 
8(t) = n(t - to), whereas if near-circularity can be assumed, 8(t) may be obtained 
from Eq. (4.32). 
If coplanar circular planetary orbits are assumed, then no difference in AV 
requirements is found between missions executed at differen; calendar times. In 
fact, substantial advantages exist for missions that can be timed to encounter the 
target planet near its heliocentric line of nodes (implying minimum plane change 
requirements) or when the combination of Earth and target planet perihelion and 
aphelion phasing is such as to minimize the semimajor axis of the required 
transfer orbit. For example, an Earth-Mars minimum-energy transfer orbit can 
have a semimajor axis from 1.12 A.U. to 1.32 A.U., resulting in a AV difference 
at Earth departure of about 500 m/s, 
4.5.1.2 Departure hyperbola. When the heliocentric transfer has been 
computed, the required spacecraft velocity in the neighborhood of the departure 
planet is found from the vis-viva equation. This velocity is in heliocentric inertial 
coordinates; the departure planet will itself possess a considerable velocity in the 
same frame. In the patched-conic method, the heliocentric transfer is assumed to 
begin at the sphere of influence boundary between the departure planet and the 
sun. This boundary (see Table 4.1) may be assumed to be at infinity with respect 
to the planet. As indicated by Eq. (4.145), the planetary departure hyperbola must 
therefore be designed to supply V,, the vector difference between the spacecraft 
transfer orbit velocity V, and the planetary velocity V,. Again, when V, is 
parallel to V,, V, is their simple scalar difference. 
We assume for convenience in this discussion that departure is from Earth. If 
the departure maneuver is executed with zero geocentric flight-path angle y, the 
maneuver execution point will define the periapsis location for the outbound half 
of a hyperbolic passage, discussed in Sec. 4.2.4 (Motion in Hyperbolic Orbits). 
The geocentric hyperbola must be tangent at infinity to the heliocentric 
transfer orbit; hence, the orientation of the departure asymptote is known in the 
heliocentric frame. The excess hyperbolic velocity V, is also known from Eq. 
(4.145), and r, is usually fixed by parking orbit requirements (r, is typically about 
6600 krn for Earth). Therefore, O,, e, AV and the departure location in the 
heliocentric frame are specified by Eqs. (4.36-4.38). Equation (4.39) allows the 
offset /3 for the passage to be computed if desired. Figure 4.22 shows the 
geometry for hyperbolic departure. 
4.5.1.3 Encounter hyperbola. The determination of V, relative to the 
target planet from the heliocentric transfer orbit has been discussed. The

for any conic orbit. If the departure or arrival planet orbit is circular,
O(t) = n(t — to), whereas if near-circularity can be assumed, O(t) may be obtained
from Eq. (4.32).

If coplanar circular planetary orbits are assumed, then no difference in AV
requirements is found between missions executed at different calendar times. In
fact, substantial advantages exist for missions that can be timed to encounter the
target planet near its heliocentric line of nodes (implying minimum plane change
requirements) or when the combination of Earth and target planet perihelion and
aphelion phasing is such as to minimize the semimajor axis of the required
transfer orbit. For example, an Earth-Mars minimum-energy transfer orbit can
have a semimajor axis from 1.12 A.U. to 1.32 A.U., resulting in a AV difference
at Earth departure of about 500 m/s.

4.5.1.2 Departure hyperbola. When the heliocentric transfer has been
computed, the required spacecraft velocity in the neighborhood of the departure
planet is found from the vis-viva equation. This velocity is in heliocentric inertial
coordinates; the departure planet will itself possess a considerable velocity in the
same frame. In the patched-conic method, the heliocentric transfer is assumed to
begin at the sphere of influence boundary between the departure planet and the
sun. This boundary (see Table 4.1) may be assumed to be at infinity with respect
to the planet. As indicated by Eq. (4.145), the planetary departure hyperbola must
therefore be designed to supply Vo, the vector difference between the spacecraft
transfer orbit velocity V, and the planetary velocity V,. Again, when V, is
parallel to V,, Vio is their simple scalar difference.

We assume for convenience in this discussion that departure is from Earth. If
the departure maneuver is executed with zero geocentric flight-path angle y, the
maneuver execution point will define the periapsis location for the outbound half
of a hyperbolic passage, discussed in Sec. 4.2.4 (Motion in Hyperbolic Orbits).

The geocentric hyperbola must be tangent at infinity to the heliocentric
transfer orbit; hence, the orientation of the departure asymptote is known in the
heliocentric frame. The excess hyperbolic velocity V.. is also known from Eq.
(4.145), and r, is usually fixed by parking orbit requirements (r, is typically about
6600 km for Earth). Therefore, 6,,¢, AV and the departure location in the
heliocentric frame are specified by Eqs. (4.36—4.38). Equation (4.39) allows the
offset B for the passage to be computed if desired. Figure 4.22 shows the
geometry for hyperbolic departure.

required parameters to be found. 
Operational requirements for the encounter will usually differ somewhat from 
those for departure. The periapsis radius is found from the approach parameters P 
and V, from Eq. (4.41). This will be of interest for flyby and orbital-injection 
missions, where a particular periapsis altitude may be appropriate for 
photography or to attain a desirable orbit about the planet. For passages where 
a gravity assist is required to allow a continuation of the mission to another planet 
or moon, the turning angle T of the passage will be critical, and /3 and r, will be 
adjusted accordingly.

Upon completion of the hyperbolic passage at a target planet, the approach 
velocity V, relative to the planet will have been turned through an angle ??. In 
the heliocentric inertial frame, the encounter thus produces the result of Fig. 4.24. 
As seen by applying Eq. (4.145) on arrival and departure, V, and V, do not 
change during the passage, but V, changes because it is turned through angle q, 
with the result that the spacecraft velocity VsD in the inertial frame is altered with 
respect to VsA. 
It will be required to know the values of VsD and ysD to compute VsD upon exit

Figure 4.24 depicts a situation in which the heliocenhic energy of the

Voyager 1 and 2, in which encounters at Jupiter were used to direct the two 
spacecraft toward Saturn (and, for Voyager 2, subsequently to Uranus and 
Neptune) much more efficiently than by direct transfer from Earth. Use of this 
technique enabled the Galileo mission both in reaching Jupiter and in the many 
satellite encounters that followed. Deprived, primarily because of political 
considerations, of an Earth departure stage that could send it directly to Jupiter,

4.5.2 Gravity-Assist Trajectories

Upon completion of the hyperbolic passage at a target planet, the approach
velocity Vio relative to the planet will have been turned through an angle WV. In
the heliocentric inertial frame, the encounter thus produces the result of Fig. 4.24.
As seen by applying Eq. (4.145) on arrival and departure, V, and V.. do not
change during the passage, but V.. changes because it is turned through angle ¥,,
with the result that the spacecraft velocity Vs, in the inertial frame is altered with
respect to Vs,.

It will be required to know the values of Vs, and ys, to compute Vs, upon exit
from the hyperbolic passage. Examination of Fig. 4.24, with AV and V known
from Eq. (4.37), yields

Vz = Vs, + AV? — 2Vs,AV cos v (4.155)

Figure 4.24 depicts a situation in which the heliocentric energy of the
spacecraft is increased (at the infinitesimal expense of that of the planet) as a
result of the hyperbolic passage. This would be applicable to missions such as
Voyager 1 and 2, in which encounters at Jupiter were used to direct the two
spacecraft toward Saturn (and, for Voyager 2, subsequently to Uranus and
Neptune) much more efficiently than by direct transfer from Earth. Use of this
technique enabled the Galileo mission both in reaching Jupiter and in the many
satellite encounters that followed. Deprived, primarily because of political
considerations, of an Earth departure stage that could send it directly to Jupiter,
Galileo was launched by a two-stage TUS toward Venus. One Venus flyby and
two Earth flybys endowed the spacecraft with sufficient energy to reach Jupiter,
albeit at the cost of greatly increased flight time. Once in elliptic orbit around
Jupiter, each encounter of a satellite was used not only to take data but also to set
up another satellite encounter on the next orbit. This allowed for more encounters
than would have been possible using a propulsive system alone. The once-exotic
gravity-assist technique was thus reduced to a routine flight operations tool.

energy loss following the encounter. 
It will be noted that in Fig. 4.24 the planetary-relative approach vector VmA is 
rotated through angle 9 in a counterclockwise or positive sense to obtain VmD, 
whereas the opposite is true in Fig. 4.25. These are typical, though not required, 
situations producing energy gain at outer planets and energy loss at inner planets. 
Consideration of the encounter geometry will show that clockwise rotation of 9 
occurs for spacecraft passage between the target body and its primary (e.g., 
between a planet and the sun), whereas counterclockwise Qr positive rotation 
results from passage behind the target body as seen from its primary. This is 
shown conceptually in Fig. 4.26. Spacecraft heliocentric energy gain or loss as a 
result of the encounter depends on the orientation of vsA and the rotation angle 9 
of the relative approach velocity VooA during encounter. 
Equation (4.37) shows that the maximum-energy gain or loss occurs if 
= 180"; in this case scalar addition of V, to Vp results. This is an idealized 
situation requiring rp = 0 for its implementation. Actually, the maximum 
heliocentric AV obtainable from an encounter occurs for a grazing passage with 
rp = R. Note that a Hohrnann trajectory yields a transfer orbit that is tangent to 
the target body orbit; Vp and Vs, are thus colinear. Examination of Fig. 4.24 or 
4.25 shows that in this case energy can only be gained (for outbound transfers) or 
lost (for inbound transfers), regardless of the sign of the rotation angle 9. 
Non-Hohmann transfers allow a wider range of encounter maneuvers.

4.5.3 Lunar Transfer

The problem of calculating lunar transfer trajectories is conceptually similar to
that of interplanetary transfer analysis, and, indeed, the method of patched conics
can be used for preliminary assessment of mission requirements. However, the
results obtained are considerably less satisfactory than for interplanetary transfers
due to a number of complicating factors.

The masses of the Earth and moon are more nearly equal than for any other
primary and satellite (excluding Pluto and Charon) in the solar system. The
moon’s sphere of influence is therefore large with respect to the Earth-moon
separation, and a spacecraft in transit between the two spends much of its time
close to the sphere-of-influence boundary. Also, the sun’s influence on the
trajectory is significant. For these reasons, the patched-conic method is less
accurate than for heliocentric transfers and yields truly useful results only for
outbound AV calculations.

ASTRODYNAMICS 179 
Accurate results are also obtained -with considerably more trouble than for 
interplanetary trajectories, because of the size of the lunar sphere of influence in 
relation to the transfer orbit dimensions. This implies that the location of the point 
where the spacecraft crosses the boundary is important in determining the 
characteristics of the transfer orbit, a fact that adds considerable complexity to the 
numerical procedures. 
We do not include an extended treatment of lunar transfer calculations here. 
Cursory mission requirements can be assessed by the methods of Sec. 4.5.1 
(Method of Patched Conics); more detailed analysis must be done via numerical 
integration of the equations of motion, possibly using the patched-conic solution 
as an initial guess. Bate et al.15 give an excellent discussion of the use of patched- 
conic techniques in lunar transfer calculations. Their treatment includes non- 
coplanar transfer analyses, important in this case because of the relatively large 
lunar orbit inclination (which is in fact not constant, but varies between 18.2" and 
28.5" over an 18.6-yr period) in the GCI frame. 
4.6 Perturbation Methods 
We have on several occasions mentioned that truly Keplerian orbits are 
essentially nonexistent and have given methods for analyzing some of the 
perturbations to Keplerian orbits that are important in spacecraft and mission 
design. Perturbation theory forms an elaborate structure in astrodynamics and 
classical celestial mechanics and, indeed, comprises much of the current 
literature in the latter subject. Such topics are completely beyond the scope of this 
text. However, many of the results cited earlier are due to perturbation theory, and 
a brief outline of this topic is in order. 
Perturbation methods are broadly divided into special and general theories. 
Special perturbation theory is ultimately characterized by the direct numerical 
integration of the equations of motion due to a dominant acceleration and one or 
more small perturbing accelerations. As with all numerical analysis, results are 
unique to the given case, and it is often unclear how to extrapolate the results of 
one situation to another case of interest. 
General perturbation analysis, historically the first approach to be developed, 
proceeds as given earlier, except that the perturbing accelerations are integrated 
analytically, at least to some given order of accuracy. Because closed-form 
integration of given perturbing accelerations will rarely be possible, series 
expansion to a desired order of accuracy is used to represent the perturbation, and 
the series integrated term by term. Analytical results are thus available, and 
broader applications and more general conclusions are possible. Nearly all 
important results have been obtained through general perturbation methods; on 
the other hand, special perturbation techniques are more applicable to practical 
mission design and execution.

180 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Common special perturbation techniques are the methods of Cowell and 
Encke and the method of variation of parameters. Cowell's method is 
conceptually the simplest, at least in the era of digital computers, and consists of 
directly integrating the equations of motion, with all desired perturbing 
accelerations included, in some inertial frame. The method is uncomplicated and 
readily amenable to the inclusion of additional perturbations if a given analysis 
proves incomplete. The primary pitfalls are those associated with the use of 
numerical integration schemes by the unwary. Reference to appropriate 
numerical analysis texts and other is recommended even if standard 
library procedures are to be used. Cowell's method is relatively slow, a factor that 
is in the modem era often irrelevant. The speed of the method is increased 
substantially, with only slight complexity, by employing spherical coordinates 
(r, 0, 4) instead of Cartesian coordinates. 
Encke's method antedates Cowell's, which is not surprising because the latter 
posed formidable implementation requirements in the precomputer era. Encke's 
method also employs numerical integration techniques, but proceeds by 
integrating the difference between a given reference orbit (often called the 
osculating or tangent orbit) and the true orbit due to the perturbing acceleration. 
Because the perturbation is assumed small (a possible pitfall in the application of 
Encke's method), the difference between the true and reference orbits is 
presumably small, and larger integration step sizes can be used for much of the 
orbit. Encke's method, depending on the situation, executes from 3 to 10 times 
faster than Cowell's. 
The method of variation of parameters is conceptually identical to that of 
general perturbation analysis, with the exception that the final step of series 
expansion and term by term integration is skipped in favor of direct numerical 
integration. In this sense, it is something of a compromise method between 
special and general perturbations. For example, the effects due to nonspherical 
primary mass distributions discussed in Sec. 4.3 are analyzed by the variation of 
parameters method. The results yield analytical rather than numerical forms for 
the variation of the parameters or elements (0 and w in this case) by obtaining 
dnldt, dwldt, etc. This allows more interesting general conclusions to be drawn 
than with a purely numerical approach; however, complete analysis of the final 
effects must still be done numerically. 
4.7 Orbital Rendezvous 
Orbital rendezvous and docking operations are essential to the execution of 
many missions, particularly those involving manned spaceflight. First proven 
during the manned Gemini flights of 1965 and 1966, rendezvous and docking was 
a required technique for the Apollo lunar landing missions and the Skylab 
program. It is essential for space shuttle missions involving satellite retrieval, 
inspection, or repair as well as assembly and support missions to the International

4.7.1 Equations of Relatlve Motion 
Preliminary rendezvous maneuvers, often called phasing maneuvers, may well 
be analyzed in an inertial frame such as GCI and carried out using the methods of 
Sec. 4.4. However, the terminal phase of rendezvous involves the closure of two 
vehicles separated by distances that are small (e.g., tens or hundreds of 
kilometers) relative to the dimensions of the orbit. It is then expected that the 
difference in acceleration experienced by the two vehicles is relatively small and 
thus that their differential motion might easily be obscured by their gross orbital 
motion. Also, guidance algorithms are generally described in terms of the 
position and velocity of one vehicle relative to another. For these reasons, a 
description of the orbital motion and maneuvers in a planetary-centered reference 
frame is often inappropriate for rendezvous analysis. Instead, it is customary to 
define a target vehicle (TV) and a chase vehicle (CV) and to describe the motion 
of the chase vehicle in a noninertial coordinate frame fixed in the target vehicle. 
In this way, one obtains the equations of relative motion between the vehicles. 
The coordinate frame for the analysis is shown in Fig. 4.27. It is assumed that 
the two orbits are in some sense "close," having similar values of the elements a, 
e, i, and fl. RT and Rc are the inertial vectors to the target and chase vehicles, 
respectively, and r is their separation vector, 
initially assumed to be small. The frame in which r is expressed is centered in the 
TV, and it is convenient to use the rotating local vertical system (r, s, z) shown in 
Fig. 4.27, where r is parallel to the TV radius vector RT, s is normal to r in 
the orbit plane, and z is perpendicular to the TV orbit plane. In this system, the 
vector equations of motion for a CV maneuvering with acceleration a and a 
nonmaneuvering TV are, from Eq. (4.6),

4.7.1 Equations of Relative Motion

Preliminary rendezvous maneuvers, often called phasing maneuvers, may well
be analyzed in an inertial frame such as GCI and carried out using the methods of
Sec. 4.4. However, the terminal phase of rendezvous involves the closure of two

of the chase vehicle in a noninertial coordinate frame fixed in the target vehicle.
In this way, one obtains the equations of relative motion between the vehicles.

The coordinate frame for the analysis is shown in Fig. 4.27. It is assumed that
the two orbits are in some sense “close,” having similar values of the elements a,
e, i, and 0. Rr and Rc are the inertial vectors to the target and chase vehicles,
respectively, and r is their separation vector,

r=Rc—Rr (4.159)

initially assumed to be small. The frame in which r is expressed is centered in the
TV, and it is convenient to use the rotating local vertical system (7, s, z) shown in
Fig. 4.27, where r is parallel to the TV radius vector Ry, s is normal to 7 in
the orbit plane, and z is perpendicular to the TV orbit plane. In this system, the
vector equations of motion for a CV maneuvering with acceleration a and a
nonmaneuvering TV are, from Eq. (4.6),

the equation of motion of the CV in the TV frame. A variety of linearized
equations may then be obtained, depending on the simplifying assumptions used.

It is seen that Eq. (4.163) reduces to Eq. (4.162) when the TV orbit is circular.

sets, in which the second-derivative tenns in true anomaly 8 are omitted. These 
and equivalent results obtained by  ones^^ give first-order corrections for 
eccentricity compared with the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations?' 
Care should be exercised in the choice of formulation used.  ones^' finds 
approximately 5% error using the Hill equations compared to results obtained 
using Stem's equations fore = 0.01, and 10% error fore = 0.05. However, error 
estimates are only approximate and depend on the actual case of interest, and 
both sets of equations contain linearkation errors that can be expected to 
dominate at longer CV to TV ranges. Classical guidance algorithms62 for 
terminal rendezvous implicitly invoke the same assumptions as for the Hill 
equations; thus, when doubt exists, it is wise to study the sensitivity of the results 
obtained to the choice of orbital eccentricity assumed and the dynamics model 
employed. 
The solution to the Hill equations in the case of unforced motion is easily 
~btained.~ The rotating coordinate system used in the analysis produces what'at 
£irst glance appear to be rather unusual trajectories. Figure 4.29 shows typical CV 
motiod3 for cases where it is above and below the orbit of the TV. Clearly, 
maneuvers to achieve rendezvous are facilitated if the CV is initially above and 
ahead or initially below and behind the TV. Rendezvous procedures are 
structured so as to attain this geometry prior to the initiation of the terminal phase 
closing maneuvers.

where 6 and Rr are the true anomaly and radius of the TV in the inertial frame.

It is seen that Eq. (4.163) reduces to Eq. (4.162) when the TV orbit is circular.
Dunning®! gives equations of intermediate complexity between the above two
sets, in which the second-derivative terms in true anomaly @ are omitted. These
and equivalent results obtained by Jones”? give first-order corrections for
eccentricity compared with the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations.*®

Care should be exercised in the choice of formulation used. Jones” finds
approximately 5% error using the Hill equations compared to results obtained
using Stern’s equations for e = 0.01, and 10% error for e = 0.05. However, error
estimates are only approximate and depend on the actual case of interest, and
both sets of equations contain linearization errors that can be expected to
dominate at longer CV to TV ranges. Classical guidance algorithms” for
terminal rendezvous implicitly invoke the same assumptions as for the Hill
equations; thus, when doubt exists, it is wise to study the sensitivity of the results
obtained to the choice of orbital eccentricity assumed and the dynamics model
employed.

The solution to the Hill equations in the case of unforced motion is easily
obtained.’ The rotating coordinate system used in the analysis produces what at
first glance appear to be rather unusual trajectories. Figure 4.29 shows typical CV
motion® for cases where it is above and below the orbit of the TV. Clearly,
maneuvers to achieve rendezvous are facilitated if the CV is initially above and
ahead or initially below and behind the TV. Rendezvous procedures are
structured so as to attain this geometry prior to the initiation of the terminal phase
closing maneuvers.

4.7.2 Rendezvous Procedures

A variety of rendezvous procedures have been implemented in the U.S.
manned flight program, and others have been proposed for unmanned vehicles

such as would be required for a planetary sample return program?7 We consider 
here the basic operational scenario for U.S. manned rendezvous missions. All 
such missions have utilized essentially circular target vehicle orbits. The baseline 
procedure that was developed during the Gemini program64 and implemented 
operationally on ~~ollo~~ is the so-called concentric flight plan (CFP) approach. 
The CFP procedure involves five basic steps: 
1) Any out-of-plane component in the CV orbit is removed by waiting until 
z = 0, in the notation of Eq. (4.162), and thrusting with acceleration a, to yield 
dzldt = 0. In the formulation of the Hill equations, this is equivalent to a small 
plane change at the line of nodes, as given by Eq. (4.124). This maneuver was not 
required to be, and typically was not, the first in the sequence and in operational 
cases often was not needed at all. 
2) A waiting period is needed to allow proper phasing to develop between the 
two vehicles, as discussed for interplanetary transfer in Section 4.5.1.1 
(Heliocentric trajectory). The "above and ahead" or "below and behind" 
geometry must be attained, together with the requirement imposed by Eq. 
(4.150). An adjustment to the CV orbit (typically a perigee raising maneuver for 
the usual case of the CV below the TV) is made to achieve the desired phasing 
prior to the next step. 
3) Upon attainment of proper vehicle phasing, the so-called constant 
differential height (CDH) or coelliptic maneuver was performed. Assuming the 
TV to occupy the higher orbit, this maneuver is done at the CV orbit apogee and 
places the chase craft in an orbit that is concentric (or coelliptic) with that of the 
target but several tens of kilometers lower. A coelliptic separation of 15 n mile 
was used for Apollo lunar rendezvous. A strong advantage of the CFP approach is 
that the CDH phase allows the next, or terminal, phase to be relatively insensitive 
to the timing and execution of earlier operations. 
4) When proper vehicle-to-vehicle phasing is obtained, the terminal phase 
initiation maneuver is executed. In Gemini and Apollo, the nominal final transfer 
maneuver was a two-impulse, non-Hohmann trajectory requiring a transfer angle 
of 130". This value was selected on the basis of simulations showing a relative 
lack of sensitivity of the arrival conditions to errors in terminal phase initiation 
(TPI) timing and impulse magnitude. Also, this transfer trajectory was shown to 
result in a minimal rotation rate in the CV-to-TV inertial line of sight during the 
closure process, a feature that is useful both in the design of guidance algorithms 
and as a piloting aid. Other final transfer trajectories are possible; Jezewski and 
~onaldson~~ have studied optimal maneuver strategies using the Clohessy- 
Wiltshire equations?* 
5) Regardless of the terminal phase maneuver selected, as the range is 
reduced, a closed-loop terminal guidance scheme will be used to control the 
reduction of range and range rate to zero. Some form of proportional guidance67 
is generally employed; whatever the technique, the orbit dynamics of the closure 
trajectory need no longer be central to the scheme. Small corrections are applied, 
based on differences between actual a6d predicted velocity vs range during

closure, to allow,the nominal transfer trajectory to be maintained by the CV as the 
target is approached. As final closure occurs, braking maneuvers are performed to 
reduce any residual relative velocity to zero in the neighborhood of the target 
vehicle. 
The rendezvous phase is complete when the chase and target vehicles are 
separated by a small distance, typically well inside 100 m, and have essentially 
zero relative velocity. This defines the stationkeeping phase, in which the 
available CV acceleration a is often assumed to dominate the differential 
accelerations in Eq. (4.162) due to the orbital dynamics effects. In such a case, for 
example, 
and similarly for the other components. Thus, the motion in the near 
neighborhood of the TV is essentially rectilinear and dominated by the CV 
control maneuvers, provided transit times are kept small relative to the orbit 
period. 
Note that stationkeeping is entirely possible even if the CV control authority is 
low; however, neglect of the orbital dynamics in local maneuvers is then not I possible. Low-impulse stationkeeping control implies maneuvers having a 
duration significant with respect to the orbital period. Orbital dynamics effects 
will always be apparent in such cases. This is graphically demonstrated in the 
case of manned maneuvering unit activities in the vicinity of the shuttle.68 
It is worth noting that the only completely passive stationkeeping positions 
possible are directly ahead of or behind the target vehicle in its orbit. Radial or 
out-of-plane offsets will, in the absence of control maneuvers, result in 
oscillations of the CV about the target during the orbital period. 
Interest in automated rendezvous and docking, or "capture," has been of great 
interest recently, in the context of satellite servicing and retrieval and for the task 
of delivering cargo to the International Space Station via unmanned expendable 
launch vehicles.69 As mentioned, this is a proven technology in the Russian space 
program (albeit not without numerous anomalies), but not so far implemented by 
the United States. The first such demonstration will occur with the NASA 
Demonstration of Automated Rendezvous Techniques (DART) program, which I 
as this is written is progressing toward a planned 2004 launch.

Problems

4.1 A spacecraft intended to map the surface of Mars is desired to be placed

inclination be if a Martian year is 687 Earth days?

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Because the spacecraft in problem 4.1 can only see a small portion of the 
planet during a low altitude pass, it is planned to map essentially all of the 
planet between the latitude limits imposed by the orbital inclination of 
problem 4.1, which you may assume to be 100" if you did not get the 
answer, by ''walking" the periapsis around the planet. Each region of 
latitude will be mapped as the planet rotates beneath the orbit, and as the 
nodal line regresses. What initial value (or values) of the argument of 
perigee q should be selected to minimize the time required to conduct 
this mission? How long will it take to map the planet in detail? 
Assume the approach velocity to Mars for the spacecraft in problem 4.1 to 
be V, = 4lan/s. What should the B-plane miss distance be to achieve a 
500-km altitude periapsis? What is the injection AV required at periapsis? 
After the high-resolution mapping outlined in problem 4.2 is completed, it 
is desired to change the orbit plane to an inclination of 90" to map the polar 
regions. What is the minimum AV required to effect this plane change? 
Explain. 
A target spacecraft occupies a circular orbit with a 100-minute period. It is 
desired to rendezvous with this spacecraft from a near-circular orbit having 
the same inclination. An initial AV = (-123,81.4) m/s is used to initiate 
closure on the target from an initial position of (x, y)o = (25, -75) krn. 
(a) Plot the approach to the target. 
(b) What terminal maneuver is required to halt the approach in the 
neighborhood of the target? 
For the initial parameters of problem 4.5, what is the proper initial closure 
maneuver for a desired rendezvous time of 25 rnin from the initial 
position? 
A Landsat spacecraft is to be placed in a 600-km altitude circular sun- 
synchronous orbit. What inclination is required? If the spacecraft is

A spacecraft intended to facilitate communications in high northerly 
latitude regions is placed in a 12-h Molniya orbit with o = 270". What is 
the 'hang time" above the northern hemisphere? 
From the 1979 edition of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac,

Propulsion 
Probably no single factor constrains the design of a space vehicle and the 
execution of its mission more than does the state of the art in propulsion 
technology. Ascknt propulsion capability, together with the physical limitations 
imposed by celestial mechanics, sets the limits on payload mass, volume, and 
configuration that bound the overall design. The economics of space flight and 
our progress in exploiting space are driven inexorably by the cost per kilogram of 
mass delivered to orbit. Mankind's reach in exploring interplanetary space is 
limited by the energy available from current upper stages. Though the advent of 
the space shuttle has expanded many of the boundaries of the spacecraft design 
environment, it is still true that the scope of most space missions is ultimately set 
by propulsion system limitations. 
Yet, despite its importance, ascent propulsion is probably the factor over 
which a spacecraft designer has the least control. Except for those involved 
directly in the areas of rocket engine, booster, or upper-stage design, most 
aerospace engineers will be in the position of customers with freight to be moved. 
A limited number of choices are available, and the final selection is seldom 
optimal for the given task, but is merely the least unsatisfactory. Rarely is a 
particular mission so important that a specific engine or launch vehicle will be 
designed to fit its needs. Indeed, there have been few boosters designed for space 
missions at all; most are converted Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBM) 
and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM) or derivatives of those vehicles. 
The Saturn family, the space shuttle, the Proton, the Zenit, and Ariane are 
conspicuous exceptions, but even as this book is written, a significant fraction of 
payloads reach space on various derivatives of the Atlas, the Delta, the Titan, and 
the Soviet Semyorka ICBM. 
We therefore take the view that ascent propulsion is essentially a "given" in 
the overall design. We do not explore in detail the multitude of considerations 
that go into the design of launch vehicles. The text by Sutton and ~iblarz' is 
probably the best source for those seeking more detail in this area. Our purpose is 
to explore the factors that are involved in the selection of launch vehicles and 
upper stages for a given mission. We have tried to include a reasonably 
comprehensive discussion of the capabilities of the various vehicles, including 
those of both current and projected availability and which could be of interest. 
However, injection into a specified trajectory does not end the consideration of 
propulsion systems required by the spacecraft systems engineer. Low-orbit 
satellites may need propulsion for drag compensation. Satellites in geosynchro- 
nous Earth orbit (GEO) require a similar system for stationkeeping purposes.

Many spacecraft will need substantial orbit adjustments or midcourse maneuvers. 
Attitude control systems will often employ small thrusters, either for direct 
control or for adjustment of spacecraft angular momentum. The future holds the 
prospect of the development of orbital transfer vehicles (OTV) for operations in 
Earth orbit. Planetary landers, such as the Surveyor, Apollo, and Viking missions 
to the moon and Mars, as well as many projected planetary landers, involve the 
development of'specialized descent propulsion systems. For these and other 
reasons, the spacecraft designer must be familiar with propulsion system 
fundamentals. 
5.1 Rocket Propulsion Fundamentals 
5.1.1 Thrust Equatjon 
The fundamental equation for rocket engine performance is the thrust 
equation: 
where 
T = thrust force 
Yn = flow rate = peVeAe 
p, = fluid density at nozzle exit 
V, = exhaust velocity at nozzle exit 
p, = exhaust pressure at nozzle exit 
pa = ambient pressure 
A, = nozzle exit area 
This equation is valid for reaction motors that generate thrust through the 
expulsion of a fluid stream without ingesting fuel or oxidizer from any source 
external to the vehicle. In aerospace applications, the working fluid is a gas, 
possibly nitrogen gas stored under pressure, combustion products from a variety 
of propellants, or hydrogen gas superheated by passage through a nuclear reactor. 
If efficiency is at all important, the gas is made as hot as possible and expanded 
through a supersonic nozzle, as in Fig. 5.1, to increase V,. The expansion ratio is 
usually made as high as possible, subject to considerations to be discussed later. . 
This of course causes the termp,A, to decrease, but the loss here is usually small 
compared to the gain in mV,. In all large operational engines to date, heating of 
the gas has been accomplished chemically, The working fluid is thus composed of 
the products of the combustion cycle producing the heat. 
Because the dominant term in the thrust equation is hVe, it is customary to 
rewrite Eq. (5.1) as

m = flow rate = p.V,A,

Pe = fluid density at nozzle exit

V, = exhaust velocity at nozzle exit
Pe = exhaust pressure at nozzle exit
Pa = ambient pressure

A, = nozzle exit area

This equation is valid for reaction motors that generate thrust through the
expulsion of a fluid stream without ingesting fuel or oxidizer from any source
external to the vehicle. In aerospace applications, the working fluid is a gas,
possibly nitrogen gas stored under pressure, combustion products from a variety
of propellants, or hydrogen gas superheated by passage through a nuclear reactor.

If efficiency is at all important, the gas is made as hot as possible and expanded
through a supersonic nozzle, as in Fig. 5.1, to increase V,. The expansion ratio is
usually made as high as possible, subject to considerations to be discussed later.
This of course causes the term p,A, to decrease, but the loss here is usually small
compared to the gain in mV,. In all large operational engines to date, heating of
the gas has been accomplished chemically. The working fluid is thus composed of
the products of the combustion cycle producing the heat.

Because the dominant term in the thrust equation is mV,, it is customary to
rewrite Eq. (5.1) as

T= mV. + (Pe — Pa)Ac/m) = MVeq (5.2)

where Veq is the equivalent exhaust velocity. The portion of Veq due to 
the pressure term will nearly always be small relative to V, and back-of-the- 
envelope performance calculations often make use of this fact by dropping V,, 
for the more simply obtained V,. However, the pressure term is by no means 
negligible when accurate results are desired, as later examples will show. Even 
rough calculations can sometimes require its inclusion. For example, the space 
shuttle main engine suffers about a 20% loss of thrust at sea level compared to 
vacuum conditions because of pressure effects.

in basic physics. It is far more customary in engineering circles to use instead the 
weight flow to normalize the total impulse, yielding 
With the definition of Eq. (5.5b), specific impulse is measured in seconds in 
any consistent system of units, a not inconsiderable advantage. Note, however, 
that Eq. (5.5a) reveals the fundamental physics of the situation; the specific 
impulse, or change in momentum per unit mass, is merely the equivalent exhaust 
velocity. Specific impulse is the most important single measure of rocket engine 
performance, because it relates in a fundamental way to the payload-canying 
capability of the overall vehicle, as we shall see in later sections. 
5.1.3 Nozzle Expansion I 
Returning to Eq. (5.1), it is of interest to explore some general considerations 
in the operation of rocket engines for maximum efficiency. It is clear from 
Eq. (5.1) that p, < pa is undesirable, because the pressure term is then negative 
and reduces thrust. Also, this condition can be hannful when operating inside the 
atmosphere, because the exit flow will tend to separate from the walls of the 
nozzle, producing a region of recirculating flow that can under some conditions 
set up destructive vibrations due to unbalanced and shifting pressure 
distributions. 
It is not immediately clear, but is true, that p, % p, is also to be avoided. This 
situation basically indicates a failure to expand the exhaust nozzle as much as 
might be done, with a consequent loss of potentially available thrust. And again, 
within-the-atmosphere operation at very large exit-to-ambient pressure ratios can 
cause undesirable interactions of the exhaust plume with the external airflow. 
It is thus ideal to have a close match between nozzle exit pressure and 
ambient pressure. There are practical limits to the degree to which this can be 
accomplished. An engine operating in vacuum would require an infinite exit area 
to obtainp, = 0. Very large nozzles introduce a mass penalty that can obviate the 
additional thrust obtained. Large nozzles are more difficult to gimbal for thrust 1 
vector control and may be unacceptable if more than one engine is to be mounted 
on the same vehicle base. Furthemore, it is clear that engines intended for ascent 
propulsion cannot in any case provide an ideal pressure match at more than one 
altitude. An effective compromise is to operate the nozzle as much as possible in 
a slightly underexpanded condition, the effects of which are less harmful than 
overexpansion. Still, as a practical matter, overexpansion must often be tolerated. 
Shuttle main engines sized for sea level operation would be extremely inefficient I 
for high-altitude operation. These engines operate with an exit pressure of about

that Eq. (5.5a) reveals the fundamental physics of the situation; the specific

performance, because it relates in a fundamental way to the payload-carrying
capability of the overall vehicle, as we shall see in later sections.

5.1.3 Nozzle Expansion

Returning to Eq. (5.1), it is of interest to explore some general considerations
in the operation of rocket engines for maximum efficiency. It is clear from
Eq. (5.1) that pe < pg is undesirable, because the pressure term is then negative
and reduces thrust. Also, this condition can be harmful when operating inside the
atmosphere, because the exit flow will tend to separate from the walls of the
nozzle, producing a region of recirculating flow that can under some conditions
set up destructive vibrations due to unbalanced and shifting pressure
distributions.

It is not immediately clear, but is true, that p, > pz is also to be avoided. This
situation basically indicates a failure to expand the exhaust nozzle as much as
might be done, with a consequent loss of potentially available thrust. And again,
within-the-atmosphere operation at very large exit-to-ambient pressure ratios can
cause undesirable interactions of the exhaust plume with the external airflow.

It is thus ideal to have a close match between nozzle exit pressure and
ambient pressure. There are practical limits to the degree to which this can be
accomplished. An engine operating in vacuum would require an infinite exit area
to obtain p, = 0. Very large nozzles introduce a mass penalty that can obviate the
additional thrust obtained. Large nozzles are more difficult to gimbal for thrust
vector contro] and may be unacceptable if more than one engine is to be mounted
on the same vehicle base. Furthermore, it is clear that engines intended for ascent
propulsion cannot in any case provide an ideal pressure match at more than one
altitude. An effective compromise is to operate the nozzle as much as possible in
a slightly underexpanded condition, the effects of which are less harmful than
overexpansion. Still, as a practical matter, overexpansion must often be tolerated.
Shuttle main engines sized for sea level operation would be extremely inefficient
for high-altitude operation. These engines operate with an exit pressure of about

PROPULSION 1 97 
0.08 atm and thus do not approach an underkxpanded condition until an altitude 
of about 18 krn is reached. 
As noted earlier, choice of expansion ratio for conventional nozzle, fixed-area 
ratio engines is usually a compromise. For engines that operate from liftoff 
through the atmosphere and into space, as do most lower-stage engines, the 
compromise will be driven by performance and liftoff thrust requirements. 
Engines that provide most of the liftoff thrust and do not perform long in vacuum 
have lower optimal expansion ratios than those that operate solely in space. In 
this latter case, the highest practical expansion ratio is usually constrained by the 
available volume and increasing nozzle weight. Engines such as the space shuttle 
main engine (SSME) and the Atlas sustainer, which must operate at liftoff but 
perform much of their work in space, are the most difficult compromise, requiring 
a trade between vacuum performance, sea level performance, and other factors. 
The maximum expansion ratio is often limited by the need to prevent flow 
separation in the nozzle, with its resulting asymmetric side loads. 
Even some space engines are limited by this problem. In the case of the 5-2, a 
250,000-lb thrust L02/LH2 engine used in the second and third stages of the 
Saturn 5, it was desired to test the engines in a sea level environment even though 
all flight operations would be in vacuum. This avoided the expense of the very 
large vacuum test facilities that would have been needed for each test of a higher- 
expansion-ratio engine. The J-2 was marginal in its ability to maintain full flow at 
the nozzle exit under these conditions and was frequently plagued by flow 
separation and sideloads during testing. The problem was most annoying during 
engine startup and at off-design operation. 
A variety of unconventional nozzle concepts have been suggested that have as 
their goal the achievement of optimum expansion at all altitudes. The concept 
that these nozzles have in common is a free expansion and deflection of the jet. 
The most prominent examples are plug or spike nozzles and the expansion- 
deflection (ED) nozzles. 
A plug or spike nozzle is depicted in Fig. 5.2. The combustion chamber is a

the angle being defined by the overall characteristics of the engine. The gas 
impinges on the central plug, which is carefully contoured to turn the flow in the 
aft direction. The unconfined gas tends to expand, even as its momentum carries 
it inboard and along the plug. The boundary condition that must be satisfied by 
the outer sheath of gas is that it match the ambient pressure; the stream expands to

One disadvantage of the plug nozzle is that the heavy, high-pressure 
combustion section is the largest diameter of the engine rather than a 
small, compact cylinder, thus resulting in a heavy engine. The expansion- 
deflection concept was an attempt to obtain a pressure-compensating nozzle in a 
more nearly conventional overall shape. A central plug shaped like an inverted 
mushroom turns the flow from the combustion chamber outward and nearly 
horizontal, as in Fig. 5.4. The contoured outer skirt then turns the flow aft. 
The pressure compensation is supposed to come from the degree of expansion 
into the annular central space behind the plug. Without secondary flow this does 
not work well under all combinations of expansion ratio and ambient pressure, 
because the self-pumping action of the flow tends to close the flow behind the 
plug, creating a low-pressure area behind the plug base. This results in a 
conventional aerodynamic "pressure drag," which can seriously inhibit engine 
performance. A large secondary flow from the turbopump system or from an 
ambient air bleed may be required to obtain the desired performance. 
A variation on these concepts is shown in Fig. 5.5. This is sometimes called 
the "linear plug," because the combustors and the deflection surface form a linear 
array. This concept is especially well suited to lifting body vehicles. This 
application may see the first flight use of a pressure-compensated nozzle for space

judgment. It establishes the parameters on which exhaust velocity, and hence specific

will produce higher temperatures than a reaction such as 
because of the inherent differences in bonding energy. However, the rate of 
energy release also affects the chamber temperature; the combustion process is 
essentially an equilibrium reaction whose rate depends on equilibrium 
"constants" that are functions of pressure. Reactions yielding products having 
a lower specific volume than the constituents, such as 
will proceed faster at higher pressure, releasing energy at a greater rate. The net 
result is a generally small but useful temperature increase due to chamber 
pressure, which is not seen in the above simplified model. 
Also, most large, liquid-fueled rocket engines are regeneratively cooled, meaning 
that the thrust chamber and nozzle are cooled by the flow of propellaat in a 
surrounding jacket prior to injection and combustion. This process, intended to protect 
the metal walls, removes little heat from the main flow (thus allowing the adiabatic 
flow assumption to be retained) but may raise the precombustion fuel temperature by 
several hundred degrees, thus raising the energy level of the propellant. This effect can 
add several seconds of I, compared to that predicted by Eq. (5.8). 
The utility of k as a parameter describing the gas is somewhat questionable in a 
chemically reacting flow. For simple diatomic gases at temperatures below 
roughly 500 K, it is both theoretically and observably true that k = 7/5. For 
example, this is true for air (neglecting C02 and other minor constituents). At 
higher temperatures c,, and c, are not constant (the gas is not "calorically 
perfect") and do not allow the static enthalpy to be written in the form 
as we did earlier in Eq. (5.6). The similarity parameter k thus has little meaning 
and does not appear in the basic equations that must be solved to obtain the 
exhaust velocity. However, it is commonly found that good results can be 
obtained using Eq. (5.8) and similar calorically perfect gas results, provided that 
an empirically determined "hot k" is used. This will be on the order of k = 
1.21-1.26 for a wide range of fuels and oxidizers. Values of k for high 
temperature air may be found in Appendix B. 
In computing specific impulse, as opposed to exhaust velocity, it is necessary 
to account for the pressure term. Again, it is typically not large, but is significant, 
because payload mass is highly sensitive to Isp. Subject to the same

energy release also affects the chamber temperature; the combustion process is
essentially an equilibrium reaction whose rate depends on equilibrium
“constants” that are functions of pressure. Reactions yielding products having
a lower specific volume than the constituents, such as

will proceed faster at higher pressure, releasing energy at a greater rate. The net

chambers, is the use of a convergent-divergent nozzle to achieve the transition 
from subsonic to supersonic flow. Various shapes are possible for the subsonic 
converging section, because the flow is not particularly sensitive to the shape in 
this region. A simple cone, faired smoothly into cylindrical combustion zone and 
the rounded throat, is usually satisfactory. For the divergent section, a cone is the 
most straightforward and obvious shape and indeed was used in all early rocket 
designs. The chosen cone angle was a compromise between excessive length, 
mass, and friction loss for a small angle vs the loss due to nonaxial flow velocity 
for larger angles. 
The classic optimum conical nozzle tends to have about a 15" half-angle. Such 
an angle was generally satisfactory for low-pressure engines operating at modest 
expansion ratios. As chamber pressures and expansion ratios increased 'in the 
search for higher performance, conic nozzles became unsatisfactory. The 
increased length needed in such cases results in greater weight and high moment 
of inertia, which causes difficulty in gimballing the motor for thrust vector 
control. This gave rise to the so-called "bell" or contoured nozzle. This concept 
involves expanding the flow at a large initial angle and then turning it so that it 
exits in a nearly axial direction (most nozzles will still have a small divergence 
angle, e.g., 2" at the exit). Design of the nozzle to achieve this turning of the flow

without producing undesired shock waves requires the application of the method 
of characteristics and is beyond the intended scope of this text. Bell or contour 
nozzles are often referred to by the percentage of length as compared to a 15" 
cone of the same expansion ratio. For example, an 80% bell has a length 80% of 
that of the equivalent conic nozzle. 
The efficiency or thrust coefficient of bell and cone nozzles is essentially the 
same. Although the flow exiting the bell is more nearly axial, the losses involved 
in turning the flow tend to compensate for this advantage. Practical engine 
designs turn the flow quite rapidly after the sonic throat, a process that introduces 
various inefficiencies. Gradually contoured nozzles such as used in high-speed 
wind tunnels are possible but tend to be quite long and generally do not offer 
sufficient advantage to compensate for their weight, volume, and cost penalty.

A variety of cooling concepts have been proposed for use in rocket engines, 
many of which have seen operational use, often in combination. The most common 
approach for large engines with lengthy operating times is "regenerative cooling," 
mentioned earlier, where one of the propellants is passed through cooling passages 
in the thrust chamber and nozzle wall before being injected into the combustion 
chamber. This very effective and efficient approach is usually supplemented by film 
or boundary-layer cooling, where propellant is injected so as to form a cooler, fuel- 
rich zone near the walls. This is accomplished by the relatively simple means of 
altering the propellant distribution at the injector, which usually consists of a

5.1.6 Engine Cooling

A variety of cooling concepts have been proposed for use in rocket engines,
many of which have seen operational use, often in combination. The most common
approach for large engines with lengthy operating times is “regenerative cooling,”
mentioned earlier, where one of the propellants is passed through cooling passages
in the thrust chamber and nozzle wali before being injected into the combustion
chamber. This very effective and efficient approach is usually supplemented by film
or boundary-layer cooling, where propellant is injected so as to form a cooler, fuel-
rich zone near the walls. This is accomplished by the relatively simple means of
altering the propellant distribution at the injector, which usually consists of a
“shower head” arrangement of many small entrance ports for fuel and oxidizer. In

206 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
some cases injector orifices may be oriented to spray directly on the engine wall. 
Probably the most extreme example occurred in the pioneering V-2, which had a 
series of holes drilled just above the throat to bleed in raw fuel to protect the 
combustion chamber, which was fabricated from mild steel. In most regenerative 
cooling designs, the fuel is used as the coolant, although oxidizer has been used and 
is increasingly suggested for high-mixture-ratio, high-pressure L02/LH2 engines. 
Ablative thrust chambers are commonly employed in engines designed for a 
single use, in cases where neither propellant is an efficient coolant, or for 
operational reasons such as when deep throttling or pulse mode operation is 
required. When a wide range of throttling is available, propellant (and hence 
coolant) flow at the lower thrust settings may become so sluggish that fluid 
stagnation and overheating may occur. When pulsed operation is desired, as, for 
example, in thrusters used for on-orbit attitude or translation control, the volume of 
the coolant passages is incompatible with the requirement for short, sharp pulses. 
Ablative thrust chamber endurance of several thousand seconds has been 
demonstrated. In cases where throat erosion is critical, refractory inserts have been 
used. Ablative chambers are especially sensitive to mixture ratio distribution in the 
flow, with hot streaks causing severe local erosion, especially if oxidizer-rich. 
Radiation-cooled thrust chambers have been extensively used in smaller engine 
assemblies. Refractory metals or graphite have been commonly used in the 
fabrication of such motors, which tend to be simple and of reasonably low mass and 
have nearly unlimited life. However, these desirable features are sometimes offset 
by the nature of radiation cooling, which causes diaculty in some applications. The 
outer surface of the thrust chamber, which rejects heat at temperatures approaching 
1500 K, must have an unimpeded view of deep space. Furthermore, any object in 
view of the thrust chamber will be exposed to substantial radiative heating. A 
compact, vehicle-integrated engine installation such as might be used for a 
regeneratively or ablatively cooled engine is thus impossible. Fully radiatively 
cooled engines of more than a few thousand pounds thrust have not been 
demonstrated to date. This is due to the materials costs and systems integration 
dif6culties of fabricating such engines. It may be noted, however, that some fairly 
large engines intended for upper-stage operation employ the extendable exit cones 
mentioned earlier, or fixed extensions, which are radiation-cooled. 
Heat sink thrust chambers, where the chamber wall material simply 
accumulates the heat by bulk temperature increase during the burn, are fairly 
common as low-cost, short-duration ground test articles, which are required for 
injector performance characterization. They are rarely used in flight hardware, 
except as buried units subjected to brief, infrequent pulses. The ability of 
refractory metals such as niobium (columbium) to operate at very high 
temperatures allows use of a 'hybrid" cooling scheme. The niobium thrust 
charnber/nozzle assembly acts as a refractory heat sink, however, the interior of 
the nozzle has a sufficiently good view of space that much of the heat energy can 
be radiated away, allowing long-duration operation. In most cases, boundary- 
layer cooling, i.e., excess fuel near the walls, helps minimize heat transfer. With

shuttle attitude control thrusters use this approach. 
An interesting concept, worthwhile only with hydrogen, is dump cooling. 
Hydrogen, if heated to a few hundred degrees and exhaust d through a nozzle, 
has a specific impulse equal to many bipropellant combi 1 ations. In such an 
engine, the bipropellants would be burned in the convehtional manner and 
exhausted, while hydrogen would pass through the chambe$ walls, being heated 
in the process and exhausted through its own nozzle. Previous studies have not 
shown the performance to be worth the complexity of a three-propellant system, 
but future applications may be possible. 
Such concepts as spray cooling, in which the liquid coolant is sprayed against 
the combustion chamber wall rather than caused to flow over it, can 
accommodate very high heat fluxes but have not been required by propulsion 
systems used to date. Similarly, transpiration cooling, where the coolant is 
uniformly "sweated" through a porous wall, has hot shown enough performance 
advantage over less expensive and more conventional boundary-layer cooling to 
justify its use. However, transpiration cooling has found use ifi some L02/LH2 
injectors, such as those for the J-2 and RL-10. 
The F-1 engine used an interesting variant in which turbopump exhaust gas 
was dumped into a double-w@led nozzle extension and then, via a series of holes 
in the inner wall, into the boundary layer of the main stream. This cooled the 
extension while getting rid of the often troublesome turbine exhaust by entraining 
it in the main flow. 
5.1.7 Combustion Cycles 
Rocket engine combustion cycles have grown steadily more complex over the 
years as designers have sought to obtain the maximum possible specific impulse 
and thrust from hardware of minimum weight. The current state of the art in this 
field is probably exemplified by the SSME. However, basic designs remain in 
wide use, as exemplified by the fact that the simple pressure-feed system 
I continues to be a method of choice where simplicity, reliability, and low cost are 
driving requirements. 
As noted, a major driver in engine cycle development is the desire for higher 
I performance. This translates to higher combustion chamber pressure, efficient use 
of propellant, and minimum structural mass. Because structural mass increases 
rapidly with tank size and pressure, the need for pump-fed, as opposed to 1 pressure-fed, engines was recognized quite early. Dr. Robert H. Goddard began 
flying pump-fed engines in the 1920s to prove the concept, while the German 
rocket engineers at Peenemiinde went immediately to pump-fed systems for the 
larger vehicles such as the V-2. 
The early vehicles, of which the V-2 and the U.S. Army Redstone are 
classical examples, 'used a turbopump system in which the hot gas, which

rocket engineers at Peenemiinde went immediately to pump-fed systems for the
larger vehicles such as the V-2.

The early vehicles, of which the V-2 and the U.S. Army Redstone are
classical examples, ‘used a turbopump system in which the hot gas, which
drove the turbine that in turn drove the pumps,.was provided by a source

208 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Z completely separate from the rocket propellants. The hot gas was obtained by 
decomposing hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, a process accom- 
plished by spraying the peroxide and a solution of potassium permanganate 
into a reaction chamber. These substances were stored in pressurized tanks, an 
approach with the virtue of simplicity in that operation of the turbine drive 
was decoupled from that of the main propulsion system. Also, the low- 
temperature turbine exhaust made turbine design relatively simple. On the 
negative side, there was a considerable mass penalty because of the low 
energy of the hydrogen peroxide and because of the extra tanks required to 
hold the peroxide and the pemanganate. The basic concept worked quite well, 
however, and was applied in a variety of systems well into the late 1950s. The 
various derivatives of the original Russian ICBM, such as the Soyuz and 
Molniya launchers, still use this approach. 
Next to be developed was the bootstrap gas generator concept, in which a small 
fraction of the main propellant is tapped off at the pump outlet and burned in a gas 
generator to provide turbine drive gas. This approach has several advantages. The use 
of existing propellants saves weight because the increase in tank size to 
accommodate the turbine requirements imposes a smaller penalty than the use of 
separate tanks. Also, in order to provide gas temperatures tolerable for turbine 
materials, it is necessary to operate well away from the stoichiometric fuel-to- 
oxidizer ratio. This is usually done by running substantially on the fuel-rich side, 
which provides a nonoxidizing atmosphere for the turbine. Some vehicles, such as 
the recently-retired Ariane IV, run the gas generators near the stoichiometric ratio 
and cool the gas to an acceptable temperature by injecting water downstream of the 
combustion zone. 
A number of systems developed in the 1950s and 1960s used the bootstrap gas 
generator approach. The first such vehicles were the Navaho booster and the 
Atlas, Titan, Thor, and Jupiter missiles. The F-1 and 5-2 engines for the Saturn 
series used similar cycles, as in fact have most of the vehicles in the U.S. 
inventory of launchers, excluding the space shuttle. 
Individual engine systems vary in detail regarding implementation, 
particularly in the starting cycle. Some use small ground start tanks filled with 
propellant to get the engines started and up to steady-state speed. In other cases, 
the start tanks are mounted on the vehicle and refilled from the main propellant 
tanks to allow later use with vernier engines providing velocity trim after main 
engine shutdown. Still others, use solid-propellant charges that burn for about a 
second to spin up the pumps and provide an ignition source for the gas generator. 
The 5-2 used hydrogen gas from an engine-mounted pressure bottle, which was

completely separate from the rocket propellants. The hot gas was obtained by
decomposing hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, a process accom-
plished by spraying the peroxide and a solution of potassium permanganate
into a reaction chamber. These substances were stored in pressurized tanks, an
approach with the virtue of simplicity in that operation of the turbine drive
was decoupled from that of the main propulsion system. Also, the low-
temperature turbine exhaust made turbine design relatively simple. On the
negative side, there was a considerable mass penalty because of the low
energy of the hydrogen peroxide and because of the extra tanks required to
hold the peroxide and the permanganate. The basic concept worked quite well,
however, and was applied in a variety of systems well into the late 1950s. The
various derivatives of the original Russian ICBM, such as the Soyuz and
Molniya launchers, still use this approach.

Next to be developed was the bootstrap gas generator concept, in which a small
fraction of the main propellant is tapped off at the pump outlet and burned in a gas
generator to provide turbine drive gas. This approach has several advantages. The use
of existing propellants saves weight because the increase in tank size to
accommodate the turbine requirements imposes a smaller penalty than the use of
separate tanks. Also, in order to provide gas temperatures tolerable for turbine
materials, it is necessary to operate well away from the stoichiometric fuel-to-
oxidizer ratio. This is usually done by running substantially on the fuel-rich side,
which provides a nonoxidizing atmosphere for the turbine. Some vehicles, such as
the recently-retired Ariane IV, run the gas generators near the stoichiometric ratio
and cool the gas to an acceptable temperature by injecting water downstream of the
combustion zone.

A number of systems developed in the 1950s and 1960s used the bootstrap gas
generator approach. The first such vehicles were the Navaho booster and the
Atlas, Titan, Thor, and Jupiter missiles. The F-1 and J-2 engines for the Saturn
series used similar cycles, as in fact have most of the vehicles in the U.S.
inventory of launchers, excluding the space shuttle.

Individual engine systems vary in detail regarding implementation,
particularly in the starting cycle. Some use small ground start tanks filled with
propellant to get the engines started and up to steady-state speed. In other cases,
the start tanks are mounted on the vehicle and refilled from the main propellant
tanks to allow later use with vernier engines providing velocity trim after main
engine shutdown. Still others, use solid-propellant charges that burn for about a
second to spin up the pumps and provide an ignition source for the gas generator.
The J-2 used hydrogen gas from an engine-mounted pressure bottle, which was
repressurized during the burn to allow orbital restart.

The F-1, the 1.5-million-1b-thrust first-stage engine for the Saturn 5, used no
auxiliary starting system at all. By the time this engine was designed, it was
recognized that a bootstrap gas generator system could be self-starting. Simply
opening the valves at the tank pressure used to provide inlet pump head and
igniting the propellants would start the pumps, which would increase combustion

These equations are not solvable in closed form but may be integrated 
numerically, subject to appropriate initial conditions. Note that, in practice, this 
particular formulation would not necessarily be used for numerical calculations. 
If numerical integration is to be employed, it is often simplest to work in 
Cartesian coordinates directly with the vector equations, 
where f (-) is the sum, per unit mass, of forces on the vehicle. When obtained, the 
results are easily transformed to a coordinate system that is more appropriate to 
ascent from a spherical planet. However, Eqs. (5.1 1) in the form given have the 
advantage of portraying the physical parameters of interest most directly and are 
used here for that reason. 
The assumption of a nonrotating planet introduces three basic errors. First, 
Eqs. (5.1 1) are valid as written only in an inertial frame; neglect of planetary 
rotation involves neglect of the centrifugal and Coriolis forces generated by the 
transformation of the time derivatives to a rotating frame. Predictions of position 
and, to a smaller extent, velocity relative to the planetary surface will be in error 
if the rotational effect is omitted. 
The atmosphere shares the planetary rotation, which tends to carry the vehicle 
along with it, thus altering the trajectory. Also, errors are introduced in the 
aerodynamic modeling of the flight vehicle if the atmosphere-relative velocity V' 
is not used. 
Finally, planetary rotation aids the launch by providing an initial velocity in 
the direction of rotation. The extent to which this is helpful depends on the 
vehicle design and, as shown in Chapter 4, on the launch site latitude and launch 
azimuth. 
None of these factors is important in the present discussion. Provided lift and 
drag are computed using planetary-relative velocity, rotating atmosphere effects 
are usually ignored except for reentry calculations, and often there as well. 
Coriolis and centrifugal terms are important at the preliminary design level when 
calculating ballistic missile trajectories, but usually not otherwise. Finally, the 
effect of planetary rotation on vehicle performance can be modeled simply by 
specifying the appropriate initial condition on the inertially referenced launch 
velocity. 
The angle a, the vehicle pitch angle in conventional flight mechanics 
terminology, is a control variable. In general, it is desired that the vehicle adhere 
to some specific predetermined flight path (position and velocity history) as a

provide the required commands to follow the chosen trajectory. The guidance 
commands ultimately translate to specification of a prescribed vehicle attitude, 
represented here by the pitch angle cr. 
The assumption that the vehicle pitch angle defines the thrust axis alignment 
ignores small, transient variations about this mean condition that are commonly 
used for implementation of vehicle steering commands via thrust vector control. 
For example, some or all of the engines may be gimballed slightly (a 2 to 5" range 
is typical for lower stages, less than lo for upper stages) to generate a force 
perpendicular to the thrust axis and hence a moment about the center of mass to 
allow control of vehicle attitude. It is the task of the vehicle autopilot to translate 
attitude requests from the guidance logic into engine gimbal angles for steering. 
Because the gimbal angles are typically small, preliminary calculations often 
omit this effect; i.e., the autopilot is not modeled, and it is assumed that the 
vehicle points as required to shape the trajectory. Once a suitable family of ascent 
trajectories is found, higher order models including guidance and autopilot 
functions are used to establish detailed performance. 
As discussed previously, methods other than engine gimballing may be used to 
effect thrust vector control. These include nozzle injection, jet vanes or, when 
several engines are present, differential throttling. Finally, the vehicle may in 
some cases be steered, or at. least stabilized, aerodynamically. 
If the engines are throttled, as is the case with a space shuttle ascent, then T is 
also a control variable. Calculation of thrust from basic engine parameters was 
discussed in the previous section. If thrust is constant, a state variable may be 
eliminated, as Eq. (5.11e) integrates to yield 
The lift and drag coefficients contain the information on vehicle aerodynamic 
behavior. For a specified body shape, CL and CD are functions of Mach number, 
Reynolds number, and the angle of attack. Except at very low speeds, which 
constitute an insignificant portion of the ascent flight, the dependence on 
Reynolds number is unimportant. For the flight regimes of interest in typical 
ascent performance calculations, and for a given Mach number, CL is 
proportional to a and CD is proportional to 2. 
As before, the preceding statement contains the implicit assumption that the 
vehicle thrust axis is aligned with the geometric centerline, to which the 
aerodynamic angle of attack is referenced, and that the center of mass lies along 
the centerline. These assumptions are usually appropriate at the preliminary 
design level, but will rarely be strictly true. If the vehicle center of mass is offset 
from whatever aerodynamic symmetry axes exist, as is the case with the space 
shuttle, the thrust axis cannot be aligned with the centerline and the pitch angle 
will not equal the aerodynamic angle of attack. And, as mentioned, if the vehicle is 
steered via thrust vector control, transient offsets of the thrust axis from the center 
of mass are used to generate attitude control moments. These effects may often 
PROPULSION 217

provide the required commands to follow the chosen trajectory. The guidance
commands ultimately translate to specification of a prescribed vehicle attitude,
represented here by the pitch angle a.

The assumption that the vehicle pitch angle defines the thrust axis alignment
ignores small, transient variations about this mean condition that are commonly
used for implementation of vehicle steering commands via thrust vector control.
For example, some or all of the engines may be gimballed slightly (a 2 to 5° range
is typical for lower stages, less than 1° for upper stages) to generate a force
perpendicular to the thrust axis and hence a moment about the center of mass to
allow control of vehicle attitude. It is the task of the vehicle autopilot to translate
attitude requests from the guidance logic into engine gimbal angles for steering.
Because the gimbal angles are typically small, preliminary calculations often
omit this effect; i.e., the autopilot is not modeled, and it is assumed that the
vehicle points as required to shape the trajectory. Once a suitable family of ascent
trajectories is found, higher order models including guidance and autopilot

several engines are present, differential throttling. Finally, the vehicle may in
some cases be steered, or at. least stabilized, aerodynamically.

The lift and drag coefficients contain the information on vehicle aerodynamic
behavior. For a specified body shape, C; and Cp are functions of Mach number,
Reynolds number, and the angle of attack. Except at very low speeds, which
constitute an insignificant portion of the ascent flight, the dependence on
Reynolds number is unimportant. For the flight regimes of interest in typical
ascent performance calculations, and for a given Mach number, C, is
proportional to a and Cp is proportional to a”.

As before, the preceding statement contains the implicit assumption that. the
vehicle thrust axis is aligned with the geometric centerline, to which the

be neglected for initial performance assessments; however, a complete six- 
degree-of-freedom simulation with guidance and autopilot models will include 
them. 
For a particular vehicle shape, CL and CD are usually obtained as functions of 
Mach number and angle of attack from experimental data, taken either in wind 
tunnels or during flight tests. A wealth of such data4" exists for various generic 
shapes of interest as well as for specific vehicles that have flown. For preliminary 
design purposes, data can usually be found that will be sufficiently representative 
of the actual vehicle. It recent times it has become possible to solve numerically 
the governing fluid dynamic equations appropriate to many vehicle con- 
figurations of interest. These computational fluid dynamic methods can often 
provide data outside the envelope of wind-tunnel test capabilities. As in so many 
areas we have discussed, the space shuttle program again provides an excellent 
example. Substantial effort was expended during the 1970s in learning to 
compute high-speed flowfields over space shuttle configurations. In some 
regimes, the information obtained represented the only aerodynamic perform- 
ance data available prior to the first flight. Subsequent comparisons with flight 
data have shown generally excellent agreement. Theoretical methods and results 
obtained are surveyed by chapman6 and ~utler.~

5.2.3 Ascent Trajectories

The objective of the powered ascent phase of a space mission is to put the
payload, often desired to be as large as possible, into a specified orbit. The
manner in which this is done is important because small changes in the overall
ascent profile can have significant effects on the final payload that can be
delivered, as well as on the design of the ascent vehicle itself. The usual desire in
astronautics is to maximize payload subject to constraints imposed by structural
stress limits, bending moments, aerodynamic heating, crew comfort, range safety
requirements, mission-abort procedures, launch site location, etc.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

During the ascent phase the rocket vehicle must in most cases satisfy two 
essentially incompatible requirements. It must climb vertically away from the 
Earth at least as far as necessary to escape the atmosphere and must execute a turn 
so that, at burnout, the flight-path angle has some desired value, usually near zero. 
Few if any missions are launched directly into an escape orbit; thus, a satisfactory 
closed orbit is practically a universally required burnout condition for the ascent 
phase of a mission, unless it is a sounding rocket or ICBM flight. Except on an 
airless planet, high altitude at orbit injection is needed to prevent immediate 
reentry, and near-horizontal injection is usually necessary to prevent the orbit 
from intersecting the planet's surface. 
A typical powered ascent into orbit will begin with an initially vertical liftoff for 
a few hundred feet, which is done to clear the launch pad prior to initiating further 
maneuvers. In general, the launch vehicle guidance system will be unable to 
execute pitch maneuvers about an arbitrary axis but will require such maneuvers to 
be done in a particular vehicle plane. This may also be a requirement due to the 
vehicle aerodynamic or structural configuration, as with the Titan 3 or space shuttle. 
In any case, if this plane does not lie along the desired launch azimuth, the rocket 
must roll to that azimuth prior to executing any further maneuvers. Following this 
roll, a pitch program is initiated to turn the vehicle from its initially vertical ascent 
to the generally required near-horizontal flight-path angle at burnout. The pitch 
program is often specified in terms of an initial pitch angle at some epoch 
(not necessarily liftoff) and a desired angular rate, daldt, as a function of time. 
This closes Eqs. (5.1 1) and allows integration of the trajectory from the launch 
pad to burnout conditions. 
Detailed examination of Eqs. (5.11) reveals a number of energy loss 
mechanisms that degrade ascent performance. These can be classified as thrust 
losses, drag losses, gravity losses, and steering losses. The selection of an ascent 
trajectory is governed by the desire to minimize these losses subject to the 
operational constraints mentioned earlier. Problems such as this are classically 
suited to the application of mathematical and computational optimization 
techniques, areas in which much theoretical work has been done. Examples with 
application to ascent trajectory optimization include the work of Bauer et al.,1° 
Well and  ando on," ~rusch,'~ and Gottlieb and ~owler?~ 
Detailed discussion of these techniques is beyond the scope of this book and to 
some extent is also beyond the scope of the current state of the art in actual launch 
operations. In practice, ascent profiles are often optimized for given vehicles and 
orbital injection conditions through considerable reliance on trial and error and 
the experience of the trajectory designer. We will examine in this section some of 
the basic considerations in trajectory design and the tradeoffs involved in the 
selection of an ascent profile. 
Thrust loss has already been discussed; here we are speaking of the 
degradation in specific impulse or thrust due to the pressure term in Eq. (5.1) 
when exit pressure is less than ambient pressure. If the engine is sized for sea 
level operation, it is then much less efficient than a fully expanded engine for the

In any case, if this plane does not lie along the desired launch azimuth, the rocket
must roll to that azimuth prior to executing any further maneuvers. Following this

to the generally required near-horizontal flight-path angle at burnout. The pitch
program is often specified in terms of an initial pitch angle at some epoch
(not necessarily liftoff) and a desired angular rate, da/dt, as a function of time.
This closes Egs. (5.11) and allows integration of the trajectory from the launch
pad to burnout conditions.

Detailed examination of Eqs. (5.11) reveals a number of energy loss
mechanisms that degrade ascent performance. These can be classified as thrust
losses, drag losses, gravity losses, and steering losses. The selection of an ascent
trajectory is governed by the desire to minimize these losses subject to the

Detailed discussion of these techniques is beyond the scope of this book and to
some extent is also beyond the scope of the current state of the art in actual launch
operations. In practice, ascent profiles are often optimized for given vehicles and
orbital injection conditions through considerable reliance on trial and error and
the experience of the trajectory designer. We will examine in this section some of
the basic considerations in trajectory design and the tradeoffs involved in the
selection of an ascent profile.

Thrust loss has already been discussed; here we are speaking of the
degradation in specific impulse or thrust due to the pressure term in Eq. (5.1)
when exit pressure is less than ambient pressure. If the engine is sized for sea
level operation, it is then much less efficient than a fully expanded engine for the

PROPULSION 227 
high-altitude portions of its flight. However, any rocket engine delivers better 
performance at higher altitudes. It is thus advantageous, from the point of 
efficient utilization of the propulsion system, to operate the vehicle at high 
altitudes as much as possible. 
The dependence of vehicle drag on atmospheric density, flight velocity, angle 
of attack, and body shape was discussed in Sec. 5.2.1 (Equations of Motion). 
From Eq. (5.14b), it is clearly desirable to operate at high altitudes, again as early 
as possible in the flight, because drag is proportional to atmospheric density. On 
the other hand, it is advantageous to ascend slowly to minimize the effect of the

speeds. This is seen in Eq. (5.1 lb), where, if we specify for example a constant 
I flight-path angular rate (i.e., constant dyldt), the required angle of attack varies

high-altitude portions of its flight. However, any rocket engine delivers better
performance at higher altitudes. It is thus advantageous, from the point of
efficient utilization of the propulsion system, to operate the vehicle at high
altitudes as much as possible.

The dependence of vehicle drag on atmospheric density, flight velocity, angle
of attack, and body shape was discussed in Sec. 5.2.1 (Equations of Motion).
From Eq. (5.14), it is clearly desirable to operate at high altitudes, again as early
as possible in the flight, because drag is proportional to atmospheric density. On
the other hand, it is advantageous to ascend slowly to minimize the effect of the
squared velocity in regions of higher density.

Gravity losses are those due to the effect of the term (gsin ‘y) in Eq. (5.11a). To
minimize this term, it is desirable to attain horizontal flight as soon as possible.
Also, careful consideration will show that, to minimize gravity losses, the ascent
phase should be completed as quickly as possible, so that energy is not expended
lifting fuel through a gravity field only to burn it later. Other factors being
equal, a high thrust-to-weight ratio is a desirable factor; an impulsive launch, as
with a cannon, is the limiting case here but is impractical on a planet with an
atmosphere. However, electromagnetic mass-drivers, which are essentially
electric cannons, have been proposed for launching payloads from lunar or
asteroid bases to the vicinity of Earth for use in orbital operations. '* The opposite
limiting case occurs when a vehicle has just sufficient thrust to balance its weight;
it then hangs in the air, expending its fuel without benefit.

Finally, steering loss is that associated with modulating the thrust vector by the
cos a term in Eq. (5.11a). Clearly, any force applied normal to the instantaneous
direction of travel is thrust that fails to add to the total vehicle velocity. Thus, any
turning of the vehicle at all is undesirable. If done, it should be done early, at low
speeds. This is seen in Eq. (5.11b), where, if we specify for example a constant
flight-path angular rate (i.e., constant dy/dr), the required angle of attack varies
as

Ti (5.46)

= sin=! [one +(g—V?/r) cos y— “nl
It is seen that larger flight velocities imply larger angles of attack to achieve a
fixed turning rate.

The preceding discussion shows the essential incompatibility of the
operational techniques that individually reduce the various ascent losses. Early
pitchover to near-horizontal flight, followed by a long, shaliow climb to altitude,
minimizes steering and gravity losses but dramatically increases drag and
aggravates the problem by reducing the operating efficiency of the power plant.
Similarly, a steep vertical climb can minimize drag losses while obtaining
maximum engine performance, at the price of expending considerable fuel to go
in a direction that is ultimately not desired. Experience reported by Fleming and
Kemp’ indicates that the various energy losses result in typical first-stage

burnout velocities about 70% of the theoretical optimdn as given in Eqs. (5.23) 
for the 0-g drag-free case. 
There are a number of special cases in pitch rate specification that are worthy 
of more detailed discussion. The first of these is the gravity turn, which is defined 
by the specification of an initial flight-path angle y and the requirement that the 
angle of attack be maintained at zero throughout the boost. In this way, no thrust 
is wasted in the sense of being applied nonnal to the fight path. All thrust is used 
to increase the magnitude of the current velocity, and a is controlled to align the 
vehicle (and hence the thrust vector) along the current velocity vector. Because 
the term g cosy in Eq. (5.1 1b) produces a component normal to the current flight 
path, a gradual turn toward the horizontal will be executed for any case other than 
an initially vertical ascent. Setting the angle of attack to zero and solving 
Eq. (5.1 1b) for pitch rate, we find 
dy L/m - (g - v2/r) cos y -- 
dt - V (5.47) 
where we note that the lift L is generally small and is zero for rotationally 
symmetric vehicles at zero angle of attack. It is seen that low velocity or small 
flight-path angle increases the turn rate. 
This approach would seem to be most efficient, as with zero angle of attack the 
acceleration V is maximized. However, this is strictly true only for launch from 
an airless planet. In the case of an Earth ascent, a rocket using a gravity turn 
would spend too much time at lower levels in the atmosphere, where other factors 
act to offset the lack of steering loss. Selection of higher initial values of y, for 
more nearly vertical flight, does not generally allow the turn to horizontal to be 
completed within the burn time of the rocket. In general, gravity turns may 
comprise portions of an ascent profile but are unsuitable for a complete mission. 
An exception is powered ascent from an airless planet such as the moon; the 
trajectories used for Lunar Module ascent flight closely approximated gravity 
turns. 
The case of constant flight-path angle is also of interest. Particularly with the 
final stage, the launch vehicle spends much of its time essentially above the 
atmosphere and accelerating horizontally to orbital velocity, with no need to nun 
the vehicle. In this case, Eq. (5.1 1b) is solved to yield for the pitch angle: 
Most trajectories can be approximated by combinations of these two 
segments, plus the constant pitch rate turn noted earlier. In practice, once a 
desired trajectory is identified, implementation is often in the form of a series of

Also, the mass of propellant carried increases with the volume enclosed, but 
the mass of the tankage required to enclose it does not. Denser fuels allow

Vanes and rings are prone to failures through erosion and thermal shock 
effects and also reduce performance by introducing drag into the exhaust stream. 
Approaches circumventing these difficulties include the use of gimballed nozzles 
and nozzle fluid injection. The most notable use of fluid injection was found in 
the Titan 3 series of solid rocket boosters. Each booster carried a tank of N2O4 
(nitrogen tetroxide) under pressure. Four banks of valves located orthogonally on 
the nozzle exit cone were used to control the injection of the N2O4 through the 
nozzle wall into the supersonic flow. In this concept, the intruding fluid produces 
a local shock wave that generates a downstream high-pressure region and a 
consequent flow deflection. Multiple valves provide various levels of sideloading 
and enhance reliability. 
The fluid injection approach is simple and reliable, but again introduces 
performance losses due to the mass of the injection system and to the generation 
of shock waves used to turn the supersonic flow. 
The minimum performance degradation for a thrust vector control system is 
obtained through the use of a gimballed nozzle. Providing a nozzle for a solid- 
propellant motor that can move freely under substantial thrust and aerodynamic 
loads while preventing leakage of very hot, high-pressure, and frequently 
corrosive gas is a major design challenge. Advances in mechanism and structural 
design as well as materials engineering have been required. Successful designs 
have evolved to meet requirements ranging from the small, multiple nozzle 
configurations of Minuteman and Polaris to the much larger single nozzle solid 
rocket boosters used on the space shuttle. A reminder of the difficulty involved in 
designing a gimballed nozzle for a solid rocket motor is provided by the in-flight

The difficulty was traced to overheating and erosion of a fluid bearing seal in the

Solid-propellant rockets are most useful for applications requiring high thrust 
from a compact package in a single burn. First stage propulsion as on the Ariane 5, 
Titan 3 and 4, and shuttle and first stage auxiliary propulsion as on A.ri.ane 4,

I PROPULSION 233 
Hybrid propulsion systems, normally consisting ofg solid fuel and a liquid 
oxidizer, offer some of the advantages (and disadvantages) of both systems. 
Performance is better than solids but, as a rule, is inferior to liquid systems. 
Hybrid motors throttle readily, are easily restarted and lend themselves to low- 
cost production. These systems received considerable attention during the 1960s, 
but further development languished afterward. Interest in hybrids is again on the 
rise, in part because of their almost total freedom from the risk of detonation in 
even the most violent impact.u 
Of particular interest for liquid-propellant engines is their ability to be 
throttled. Although not trivial to develop, this capability is far easier to include in 
a liquid-propellant engine than in a solid rocket motor and is mandatory in many 
applications such as planetary landers (Surveyor, Apollo, Viking). Throttling 
capability is also highly desirable for some ascent propulsion systems, such as the 
space shuttle, to reduce structural loads and to obtain greater control over the 
ascent profile. 
The primary difficulty in throttling is in maintaining an adequate injector 
pressure drop. For most types of combustion chamber injectors, the pressure drop 
across the injector is crucial to ensuring good atomization and mixing of the 
propellants. Adequate atomization and mixing are crucial to high performance 
and smooth operation. With a fixed injector area, pressure drop varies as 
the square of the flow rate according to 
where 
liz = mass flow rate 
A = total injector orifice cross-sectional area 
Cd = injector orifice discharge coefficient 
p = propellant density 
Ap = pressure drop across injector 
For throttling ratios up to about 3:l this can be tolerated by designing for an 
excessively high pressure drop at full thrust. This is probably acceptable only for 
relatively small systems, because the higher supply pressure will result in a 
substantially heavier overall system. 
The lunar module descent engine required approximately a 10: 1 ratio between 
full and minimum thrust using the liquid-propellant combination of nitrogen 
tetroxide and a 50150 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine. 
The propellant flow rate was controlled by variable-area cavitating venturi tubes 
(see Fig. 5.14). The contoured movable pintles were connected mechanically to a 
movable sleeve on the single element coaxial injector. As the venturi pintles 
moved to change the flow rate, the injector sleeve moved to adjust injector area to

Hybrid propulsion systems, normally consisting of a solid fuel and a liquid
oxidizer, offer some of the advantages (and disadvantages) of both systems.
Performance is better than solids but, as a rule, is inferior to liquid systems.
Hybrid motors throttle readily, are easily restarted and lend themselves to low-
cost production. These systems received considerable attention during the 1960s,
but further development languished afterward. Interest in hybrids is again on the
rise, in part because of their almost total freedom from the risk of detonation in
even the most violent impact.”

Of particular interest for liquid-propellant engines is their ability to be
throttled. Although not trivial to develop, this capability is far easier to include in
a liquid-propellant engine than in a solid rocket motor and is mandatory in many
applications such as planetary landers (Surveyor, Apollo, Viking). Throttling
capability is also highly desirable for some ascent propulsion systems, such as the
space shuttle, to reduce structural loads and to obtain greater control over the
ascent profile.

The primary difficulty in throttling is in maintaining an adequate injector
pressure drop. For most types of combustion chamber injectors, the pressure drop
across the injector is crucial to ensuring good atomization and mixing of the
propellants. Adequate atomization and mixing are crucial to high performance
and smooth operation. With a fixed injector area, pressure drop varies as
the square of the flow rate according to

Ap = tn/2pC2A? (5.50)

where

m = mass flow rate

A = total injector orifice cross-sectional area
Caz = injector orifice discharge coefficient

p = propellant density

Ap = pressure drop across injector

For throttling ratios up to about 3:1 this can be tolerated by designing for an
excessively high pressure drop at full thrust. This is probably acceptable only for
relatively small systems, because the higher supply pressure will result in a
substantially heavier overall system.

The lunar module descent engine required approximately a 10:1 ratio between
full and minimum thrust using the liquid-propellant combination of nitrogen
tetroxide and a 50/50 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine.
The propellant flow rate was controlled by variable-area cavitating venturi tubes
(see Fig. 5.14). The contoured movable pintles were connected mechanically to a
movable sleeve on the single element coaxial injector. As the venturi pintles
moved to change the flow rate, the injector sleeve moved to adjust injector area to

maintain a suitable pressure drop. This system could throttle over a range of 
nearly 20: 1 while maintaining satisfactory performance. 
Alternative approaches such as injecting an inert gas into the injector to 
entrain the liquid and maintain the flow momentum during throttling have been 
tried with somewhat less success. Multielement concenrric tube injectors 
(Fig. 5.13, which were used in the RL-10 and J-2, seem to offer the best overall 
performance with liquid hydrogen and are more tolerant of throttling than other 
fixed orifice injectors. This is probably due to the high velocity of the hydrogen 
and its tendency to flash quickly to a gas as the pressure drops. This tendency is 
enhanced by the temperature increase incurred in thrust chamber cooling. Micro- 
orifice injectors (Fig. 5.16) are also less dependent upon pressure for atomization 
and mixing and thus are able to tolerate a wider range of injector pressure drops. 
Design of engine throttling systems is complex, and the details are beyond the 
scope of this text and are only peripherally relevant to the overall system design 
problem. The spacecraft systems designer must be aware of the problems and 
potential solutions in order to allow evaluation of competing concepts. From a

minimize the extent to which it is needed. The Surveyor spacecraft demonstrated

proceeded with evolution of existing designs as well as development of new 
vehicles. Some of the stages intended for use in launching commercial payloads 
from shuttle, an activity terminated after Challenger, are no longer produced. 
Further changes in both commercial launch options and U.S. government space 
transportation policies can be expected as a result of the 2003 Columbia accident; 
however, as this is written, the nature and details of such changes have not been 
defined. 
We include a discussion of currently available launch vehicles and upper 
stages, primarily to convey a sense of typical vehicle capability, requirements, 
and constraints. Questions concerning the details of launch vehicle interface 
requirements, orbital performance, etc., should in all cases be referred to a current 
edition of the user's guide available from the manufacturer of the particular 
vehicle. 
With the changing world political climate, U.S. payloads are now flying on 
Russian and Chinese launch vehicles as well as U.S. vehicles and the European 
Ariane series. Some commercially developed vehicles have also appeared. 
Launch vehicles at present fall into two categories: the U.S. Space 
Transportation System (STS) and expendable vehicles. The expendable family 
comprises a variety of vehicles, many of them derived from military IRBMs and 
ICBMs, which can accommodate payloads ranging from a few kilograms in LEO 
to several thousand kilograms in interplanetary trajectories.

aspects of the space shuttle system will be familiar to most readers, we will 
describe it briefly here for the sake of completeness. The major components of the 
system are shown in Fig. 5.17. The central component of the shuttle "stack" is the 
Orbiter, a delta-winged aerospacecraft that contains the crew accommodations 
and cargo bay as well as main, auxiliary, and attitude propulsion systems and 
propellant for orbital maneuvers, along with power generation and control 
functions. The SRBs are used during the first 2 min of flight, after which they are 
jettisoned and recovered for refurbishment and reuse. 
The external tank (ET) carries the entire supply of LO2 and LH2 for the main 
propulsion system. It is normally jettisoned just prior to orbital insertion and is 
destroyed during reentry over the Indian Ocean (for a due-East launch from Cape 
Canaveral). It is worth noting that little extra energy is required to retain the ET 
through injection into orbit, where the tank material and the residual propellant it 
carries could in some circumstances be quite useful. Many scenarios have been 
advanced for the use of surplus ETs during heavy construction work in LEO, 
though so far none have come to pass.

maintenance of environmental control. 
The shuttle is basically a low-orbit transportation system. Generally, the orbit 
achieved is nearly circular in the range of 300-400 km. The original Shuttle 
design was intended to carry a 29,500-kg (65,000-lbm) payload into a 300-km 
circular orbit at the 28.5" inclination which results from a due-East launch from 
Cape Canaveral. The earliest shuttle vehicles, Columbia and Challenger, had a 
payload capability in the 24,000- to 26,000-kg range and therefore did not fully 
meet the design requirement, whereas the later vehicles, Discovery, Atlantis, and 
Endeavour met or exceeded it. Endeavour was the replacement for the ill-fated 
Challenger and incorporated all the improvements developed over the 
intervening years. 
If a higher orbit or an inclination differing significantly from 28.5" is required, 
the payload must become lighter. It is notable that, for missions supporting 
assembly of the International Space Station in its 51.6" inclination orbit at 
400 km, the payload capacity is about 16,000 kg. 
Obviously, for missions beyond the maximum shuttle altitude (about 
1000 km), auxiliary propulsion on the payload spacecraft is mandatory. Most 
traffic beyond LEO is destined for geosynchronous orbit, although particular 
scientific or military missions such as the Global Positioning System will require 
other orbits, as discussed in Chapter 2. A small but significant number of missions 
will be intended for lunar, planetary, or other deep space targets. A variety of 
I upper stages have been developed or are under development to satisfy these 
requirements and will be discussed in some detail in later sections. The spacecraft 
1 designer is not restricted to the use of these stages, however, and may elect to 
I design his own propulsion system as part of the spacecraft. As an example, the 
fonner Hughes Aircraft Corporation (now Boeing) has elected to design its own 
propulsion stage for many of its geosynchronous orbit communications - 
spacecraft. 
I Even where full orbital transfer capability is not included with the basic 
spacecraft design, some auxiliary propulsion is often required. Again using the 
GEO example, most upper stages provide only the capability for inserting 
the spacecraft into the so-called geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO), i.e., 
the apogee raising maneuver from the initially circular orbit. This maneuver will 
require (see Chapter 4) on the order of 2.5 km/s. A second maneuver of about 
1.8 km/s combining a plane change and a perigee raising bum must be done at 
the GTO apogee. The motor for this "apogee kick" is often designed as an 
integral part of the spacecraft. 
The specialized stage approach, using mostly existing components, may 
become more popular in the future, because available stages are not often optimal 
for a given task. This choice will be influenced not only by the nature of the 
payload but by the number of missions to be flown, because a custom stage may

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
The sole shuttle launch capability exists at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) 
in Florida. Launches from this facility can achieve orbital inclinations between 
approximately 28.5" and 57" without difficulty. The lower limit is determined by 
the latitude of the launch site, as discussed in Chapter 4, and the upper limit 
results from safety constraints on SRB and ET impact zones. Inclinations outside 
these launch azimuth bounds can be (and have been) attained from KSC by using 
a "dogleg" maneuver on ascent, or by executing a plane change maneuver once in 
orbit. Both of these procedures result in a reduction in net payload delivered to 
the desired orbit. 
I Orbital inclination for many missions is not a critical parameter, and when this I 
is so, KSC is the launch site of choice. However, as discussed in Chapter 2, many 
missions (e.g., communications satellites) require equatorial orbits or (as with 1 
i 
military reconnaissance spacecraft) near-polar orbits. The requirement for a high- 
altitude equatorial orbit is met rather easily from KSC by executing any required 
plane change at the apogee of the geosynchronous transfer orbit, which can be 
chosen to occur at the equator. As discussed in Chapter 4, such a plane change 
imposes a AV requirement of approximately 0.8 km/s when performed 
separately and less when combined with the usually desired circularization 1 
I 
maneuver. 
Because, due to safety constraints, polar orbits cannot be achieved from KSC, I such requirements have been met by expendable launches from Vandenberg 
AFB (VAFB) near Lompoc, California. This site can accommodate orbits with 
inclinations from about 55" to slightly retrograde. Prior to the Challenger 
accident it had been planned to conduct shuttle launches from this facility as well, 
even though performance penalties are substantial, as seen by comparing Fig. I 
5.19 and Fig. 5.20. However, the increased concern for safety in the wake of the 
Challenger accident, as well as cost, schedule, and facility concerns, resulted in 
cancellation of these plans. We have included Figs. 5.19 and 5.20 for historical 
interest, and to provide some insight into the performance impact of launching 
north or south, without the benefit of the Earth's rotation. 
5.3.2.2 Expendable launch vehicles. During the period of space shuttle 
conceptual design and early development, it was frequently stated that when 
the STS became fully operational, expendable launch vehicles would become 
extinct. This proved incorrect, and expendable vehicles have continued to meet 
the majority of U.S., not to mention international, space launch requirements. 
Many expendable vehicles in use today have their origins in the 1960s; others, 
such as the European Space Agency's Ariane launcher family, were designed 
more recently. These vehicles are considered in the following sections.

242 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

The sole shuttle launch capability exists at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)
in Florida. Launches from this facility can achieve orbital inclinations between
approximately 28.5° and 57° without difficulty. The lower limit is determined by
the latitude of the launch site, as discussed in Chapter 4, and the upper limit
results from safety constraints on SRB and ET impact zones. Inclinations outside
these launch azimuth bounds can be (and have been) attained from KSC by using
a ‘“‘dogleg” maneuver on ascent, or by executing a plane change maneuver once in
orbit. Both of these procedures result in a reduction in net payload delivered to
the desired orbit. ‘

Orbital inclination for many missions is not a critical parameter, and when this
is so, KSC is the launch site of choice. However, as discussed in Chapter 2, many
missions (e.g., communications satellites) require equatorial orbits or (as with
military reconnaissance spacecraft) near-polar orbits. The requirement for a high-
altitude equatorial orbit is met rather easily from KSC by executing any required
plane change at the apogee of the geosynchronous transfer orbit, which can be
chosen to occur at the equator. As discussed in Chapter 4, such a plane change
imposes a AV requirement of approximately 0.8km/s when performed
separately and less when combined with the usually desired circularization
maneuver.

Because, due to safety constraints, polar orbits cannot be achieved from KSC,
such requirements have been met by expendable launches from Vandenberg
AFB (VAFB) near Lompoc, California. This site can accommodate orbits with
inclinations from about 55° to slightly retrograde. Prior to the Challenger
accident it had been planned to conduct shuttle launches from this facility as well,
even though performance penalties are substantial, as seen by comparing Fig.
5.19 and Fig. 5.20. However, the increased concern for safety in the wake of the
Challenger accident, as well as cost, schedule, and facility concerns, resulted in
cancellation of these plans. We have included Figs. 5.19 and 5.20 for historical
interest, and to provide some insight into the performance impact of launching
north or south, without the benefit of the Earth’s rotation.

5.3.2.2 Expendable launch vehicles. During the period of space shuttle
conceptual design and early development, it was frequently stated that when
the STS became fully operational, expendable launch vehicles would become
extinct. This proved incorrect, and expendable vehicles have continued to meet
the majority of U.S., not to mention international, space launch requirements.
Many expendable vehicles in use today have their origins in the 1960s; others,
such as the European Space Agency’s Ariane launcher family, were designed
more recently. These vehicles are considered in the following sections.

was antitheti"ca1 to that of the STS, consisting as it does of a very conventional 
three-stage expendable launcher. Some early consideration was given to recovery 
and reuse of the first stage, but such plans were never implemented. 
The basic Ariane 1 was optimized for delivery of payloads to GTO, an orbit 
with a perigee of 200 or 300 km and an apogee at the geosynchronous altitude of 
36,000 km. Its third stage did not have an orbital restart capability, and there was 
thus no ability to coast in LEO prior to transfer orbit initiation. This inhibited 
application of Ariane to planetary missions as well as to others requiring multiple 
maneuvers. Despite this restriction, however, clever mission design allowed 
Ariane to launch several deep space missions. The payload spacecraft was placed 
in a highly elliptical parking orbit, similar to GTO, until the proper alignment 
with the departure asymptote occurred, at which point a propulsion stage was 
ignited to initiate the remainder of the mission. 
As noted, the early Ariane was a conventional three-stage vehicle with all 
stages using pump-fed liquid propellants. The lower two stages burned Earth- 
storable propellants, and the third used cryogenic liquid oxygen and hydrogen. 
All Ariane launches are from Kourou, French Guiana, on the northeast coast of 
the South American continent. This site is only about 5" north of the equator, and 
thus has significant performance advantages for low inclination orbits and ample 
open sea areas to the east for down-range stage impact. Numerous upgrades were 
implemented, culminating in the very reliable Ariane 4 vehicle. 
In tribute to the foresight of the designers and strategists who conceived and 
implemented Ariane, it should be noted that it has become a dominant GTO 
launch vehicle. In recent years, Ariane has carried over 50% of all GTO payloads, 
far more than any other single vehicle system. The last launch of Ariane 4 was 
conducted in early 2003; this vehicle has subsequently been phased out in favor 
of the larger Ariane 5. 
The Ariane 5 family of vehicles is an essentially new design, and offers a 
major upgrade from earlier models. To the casual observer, Ariane 5 resembles 
the shuttle stack without the Orbiter. In the basic Ariane 5, two parallel-staged, 
6.4 MN thrust solid rocket motors lift a central LOX/hydrogen tank, which feeds 
a 1.1 MN thrust Vulcain rocket engine. In this version, a storable-propellant 
upper stage carries the payload to GTO. Figures 5.21a-e present the launch 
capability of the Ariane 5, while Fig. 5.22 shows the configuration options. 
Developed in response to the ever-increasing size of geostationary satellites, 
the basic Ariane 5 can deliver payloads of approximately 18,000 kg to LEO and 
6800 kg to a 7" inclination geostationary transfer orbit. The original concept was 
that the vehicle could carry two geostationary communications satellites on a 
single launch. The actual satellite mass is limited to about 6000 kg in such a case, 
with the extra mass being accorded to the carrier frame. However the weight 
growth of such satellites has been so rapid that this capability is already of only 
marginal utility. Various performance upgrades are in progress as this is written.

launched a considerable variety of payloads, including most early planetary 
missions, and in modified form served as a docking target and orbital 
maneuvering stage for four two-man Gemini missions in 1966. However, it is no 
longer used. 
The most capable of the early Atlas derivatives was the Atlas-Centaur. This 
vehicle used a modified Atlas first stage and the LH2/L02 Centaur as the second 
stage. This system has evolved into a highly reliable, adaptable vehicle that has 
launched many scientific and commercial spacecraft. 
The original Atlas is unique among launch vehicles in its use of a "balloon" 
tank structure. The propellant tanks themselves were used as the primary airframe . 
structure, and were constructed from welded, thin-gage stainless steel. Without 
substantial internal pressure, or tension supplied by external means, the tank 
structure could not support itself or the payload. Although this unique design 
feature complicated ground-handling procedures, it allowed a structural 
coefficient to be achieved that is still unmatched among liquid-propellant 
vehicles. The later Centaur structure followed the same design approach. 
Although a great variety of Atlas configurations has been used, most are no 
longer in production. The Atlas-Centaur very nearly became a casualty of the 
early-1980s purge of expendable launch vehicles. However, General Dynamics 
(now Lockheed Martin) entered the commercial market with derivatives of the 
Atlas-Centaur. The initial version, designated Atlas I, was a strengthened and 
slightly upgraded version of the late-model Atlas-Centaur. The primary change 
was an increase in nose-fairing diameter from 3.05 m (10 ft), the same as the tank 
diameter, to a choice of a 4.19 m diameter x 12.2 m (13.75 ft x 40.1 ft) or a 
3.3 m diameter x 10.36 m (10.8 ft x 34 ft) fairing, depending on payload size. 
General Dynamics then introduced the Atlas 11, with increased tank length and 
thrust in the first stage and a propellant mixture ratio change and length increase 
in Centaur. Also, the vernier engines used for roll control because the earliest 
versions were replaced with a hydrazine monopropellant system. The Atlas IIA 
incorporated these changes, plus extendable nozzles on the Centaur engines and 
upgraded avionics. The Atlas ILAS added two Castor I1 solid-propellant strap-ons 
to the Atlas IIA. First launched in 1993, the Atlas IIAS offers a GTO payload of 
approximately 3700 kg, and as of this writing is the sole member of this vehicle 
class remaining in production. 
The Centaur is a three-axis stabilized upper stage, initially developed in the 
mid-1960s, and since evolved into a true workhorse of the U.S. space program. 
Spinning payloads are mounted upon a spin table that is locked in place for 
launch. After final orbit insertion, the spin table is unlocked and spun up to the 
desired rate using small rockets. When proper spin rate and vehicle attitude are 
achieved, the payload is released. Following separation, the Centaur can 
maneuver to a new attitude and apply a AV to allow a safe distance from the 
payload to be maintained. Typical separation rates are 0.5- 1 m/s. 
The Centaur has the capability for a large number of restarts and thus can fly 
complex mission profiles, including multiple payload deployment. Early

launch site, performance suffers for delivery to an equatorial orbit. 
The Atlas family relied for decades exclusively on the Rocketdyne MA-5 
three-engine cluster (two booster engines fall away partway through the flight 
while a central sustainer engine fires throughout the launch phase). But beginning 
in 2000, Lockheed-Martin (which absorbed the General Dynamics launch vehicle 
program) introduced two new versions of the Atlas which use a two-barrel 
Russian-made RD-180 rocket engine. This engine, a derivative of a highly 
successful four-bmel engine used in Russian launchers, is used in the first stage 
of the Atlas 111 and Atlas V launch vehicles. The high performance of these 
engines substantially increased payload capacity. The family of Atlas III 
configurations is summarized in Table 5.7. 
The newest member of the Atlas family is the Atlas V design, which no longer 
uses the "stainless steel balloon" structural concept. The lower stage of Atlas V is 
a self-supporting aluminum structure, which reduces some of the operational 
problems inherent in the pressure-stabilized design, and allows easier use of 
strap-on solid rocket motors. (It is worth noting that "self-supporting" refers to 
ground loads. Most, if not all, liquid propellant launch vehicles require pressure 
in the tanks to provide resistance to compression loads and required structural 
rigidity during flight.) The Atlas V was developed as part of the USAF Evolved

different system using storable hypergolic propellants (N2O4 oxidizer and 50/50 
N2H4-UDMH fuel) in both stages. First flown in 1962, this launcher was

CONNUNARWN

Titan. The Titan family of launch vehicles was derived from the Titan ICBM
family, which is no longer a part of the U.S. strategic arsenal. The Titan 1 was a
two-stage ICBM using cryogenic liquid propellants; it first flew in 1959. This
vehicle saw little use and was rapidly replaced by the Titan 2, a substantially
different system using storable hypergolic propellants (NO, oxidizer and 50/50
N2H,-UDMH fuel) in both stages. First flown in 1962, this launcher was
subsequently man-rated for use in the Gemini program in the mid-1960s. Twelve
missions, including 10 manned flights in 20 months, were conducted between
1964 and 1966.

The Titan 3 family was developed in an effort to provide a flexible, high-
capability launch system using existing technology in a “building block”
approach. The Titan 3A added two 120-in diameter solid rocket boosters as a
“zeroth stage” configuration to an uprated Titan 2 (also 120 in diameter). The

Pegasus. The small payload market (e.g., less than 400 kg to LEO) in the 
U.S. is dominated by Orbital Science Corporation's Pegasus vehicle. This vehicle 
consists of a winged solid propellant first stage, solid propellant second and third 
stages, and an optional monopropellant orbit adjustment stage utilized on some 
flights. The Pegasus is launched from beneath a modified L-1011 carrier aircraft. 
The wing is primarily used to assist in the pull-up from horizontal flight to the 
proper climb angle, and is only lightly loaded after that. Performance data for the 
current model, Pegasus XL, is shown in Fig. 5.35. 
After the usual record of mixed results following its introduction in 1990, 
Pegasus has accumulated an enviable flight history. Through mid-2003,31 of 34 
missions (involving two different models) have been successful, with no failures 
since late 1996. 
Taurus. The Taurus launch vehicle is basically a ground-launched version of 
Pegasus, wherein a "Stage 0" - the base stage - is substituted for the L-1011 
carrier aircraft. This provides a payload upgrade to the 1400 kg range. Two 
versions of the base stage have been used, a Peacekeeper ICBM first stage and a 
Castor 120 solid rocket motor. Through mid-2003, six Taurus launches have been 
conducted, with one failure.

Other lnuhch vehicles. A significant variety of other launch vehicles, both 
U.S. and foreign, exist. However, our purpose is to provide some acquaintance 
with the major options, rather than an exhaustive discussion of all alternatives. 
Thus, many of these are beyond the intended scope of this text. Readers desiring 
information on other vehicles or more detail on those discussed herein are 
referred to the excellent compendium by Isakowitz et al.24 
5.3.2.3 Upper stages. An extensive variety of upper-stage vehicles has 
evolved over the last four decades. Some of this development was driven by the 
fact that the space shuttle is strictly a low-orbit vehicle and requires an upper 
stage of some type for delivery of payloads beyond LEO. Many of the upper 
stages derived to meet this need have been adapted for use on other launchers as 
well. In some cases, e.g., the Centaur, the stages are derivatives of previously 
existing stage designs. 
Centaur. The Centaur has been discussed earlier in connection with its 
current role as an integral part of the Atlas family of vehicles. In fact, the Centaur 
is, in one form or another, the oldest operational upper stage in the U.S. fleet, and 
retains an enviable record of operational reliability and high performance. As 
indicated earlier, there are presently two configurations, the smaller of which 
comprises the upper stage of the Atlas IIIA, with the larger version utilized on the 
Atlas IIIB and Atlas V. Vehicle properties are given in Table 5.7; both versions 
may be flown with considerable propellant offload to allow optimization for a 
given mission. 
The Centaur was also developed as a high-performance upper stage for the 
Titan and space shuttle vehicles (Centaur G and Gf). However, primarily because 
of safety concerns arising in the wake of the Challenger accident, the shuttle/ 
Centaur program was canceled in 1986. However, the Centaur G and Gf stages 
were used as upper stages for the Titan 4 vehicle. 
IUS. As noted earlier, the IUS was originally conceived as a low-cost interim 
upper stage for the shuttle pending development of a high-performance Space 
Tug. A variety of IUS concepts, based mostly on existing liquid-propellant 
stages, was examined. The final selection, however, was a concept employing 
combinations of two basic solid-propellant motors, the 6000-lb motor and the 
20,000-lb motor, producing approximately 25,000 and 62,000 1b of thrust, 
respectively. The basic two-stage vehicle would consist of a large motor first 
stage and small motor second stage, a combination optimized for delivery of 
payloads to geostationary orbit. Heavier payloads into other orbits would be 
handled by a twin-stage vehicle whose two stages both consisted of large motors. 
Both these combinations had substantial planetary capability for lower-energy 
missions such as those to the moon, Mars, or Venus. High-energy planetary 
missions were to be handled by a three-stage vehicle consisting of two large and 
one small motors.

20,000-lb motor, producing approximately 25,000 and 62,000 1b of thrust,
respectively. The basic two-stage vehicle would consist of a large motor first
stage and small motor second stage, a combination optimized for delivery of
payloads to geostationary orbit. Heavier payloads into other orbits would be
handled by a twin-stage vehicle whose two stages both consisted of large motors.
Both these combinations had substantial planetary capability for lower-energy
missions such as those to the moon, Mars, or Venus. High-energy planetary
missions were to be handled by a three-stage vehicle consisting of two large and
one small motors.

Atmospheric Entry 
6.1 Introduction 
In the early days of space exploration, the problem of controlled atmospheric 
entry was as difficult and constraining as that of rocket propulsion itself. 
Although the technology is relatively mature and well understood today, it 
remains true that any Earth orbital mission for which thg payload must be 
recovered, or any interplanetary mission targeted for a planet with an atmosphere, 
must address the issue of how to get down as well as 'how to get up. This 
obviously includes manned missions, and indeed some of the most challenging 
areas of manned spacecraft design are associated with systems and procedures for 
effective atmospheric entry. 
It is worth noting that in several hundred missions over more than four decades 
of manned spaceflight, there has been only one fatal launch accident, the 
Challenger 5 1 -L mission. Numerous launch abort procedures have evolved, and 
a variety of these (on-pad, in-flight, and abort-to-orbit) have been exercised in 
particular cases. In contrast, there have been three missions involving fatal 
reentry system failures of one kind or another (Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11, and Columbia 
STS-107), and several other "close calls." Though the technology of atmospheric 
entry is relatively mature, it remains very exacting in its demands, a characteristic 
deriving in part from the general lack of plausible abort scenarios following a 
primary system failure. 
Atmospheric entry technology is a highly interdisciplinary area of space 
vehicle design. This is due to the many different functions that must be satisfied 
by the atmospheric entry system, and to the wide range of flight regimes and 
conditions encountered during a typical entry. 
Basically, the atmospheric entry system must provide controlled dissipation of 
the combined kinetic and potential energy associated with the vehicle's speed and 
altitude at the entry interface. By controlled dissipation, we imply that both 
dynamic and thermal loads are maintained within acceptable limits during entry. 
This requires a carefully designed flight trajectory and often a precision guidance 
system to achieve the desired results. Control of the vehicle in response to

Atmospheric Entry

6.1. Introduction

In the early days of space exploration, the problem of controlled atmospheric
entry was as difficult and constraining as that of rocket propulsion itself.
Although the technology is relatively mature and well understood today, it
remains true that any Earth orbital mission for which the payload must be
recovered, or any interplanetary mission targeted for a planet with an atmosphere,
must address the issue of how to get down as well as how to get up. This
obviously includes manned missions, and indeed some of the most challenging
areas of manned spacecraft design are associated with systems and procedures for
effective atmospheric entry.

It is worth noting that in several hundred missions over more than four decades
of manned spaceflight, there has been only one fatal launch accident, the
Challenger 51-L mission. Numerous launch abort procedures have evolved, and
a variety of these (on-pad, in-flight, and abort-to-orbit) have been exercised in
particular cases. In contrast, there have been three missions involving fatal
reentry system failures of one kind or another (Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11, and Columbia
STS-107), and several other “close calls.” Though the technology of atmospheric
entry is relatively mature, it remains very exacting in its demands, a characteristic
deriving in part from the general lack of plausible abort scenarios following a
primary system failure.

Atmospheric entry technology is a highly interdisciplinary area of space
vehicle design. This is due to the many different functions that must be satisfied
by the atmospheric entry system, and to the wide range of flight regimes and
conditions encountered during a typical entry.

Basically, the atmospheric entry system must provide controlled dissipation of
the combined kinetic and potential energy associated with the vehicle’s speed and
altitude at the entry interface. By controlled dissipation, we imply that both
dynamic and thermal loads are maintained within acceptable limits during entry.
This requires a carefully designed flight trajectory and often a precision guidance
system to achieve the desired results. Control of the vehicle in response to
guidance commands implies control of lift and drag throughout the flight. This is
a nontrivial task for entry from Earth orbit, because it spans an aerodynamic flight
range from subsonic speeds to Mach 25, and even higher speeds are encountered
for hyperbolic entry. Finally, the entry system must provide suitable provisions

278 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN I 
In reduced form, the dependent variables are the non-dimensional energy 
(v21g~) and y, with p the independent variable. Because at the surface of the 
planet 
it is seen that the entry energy is normalized to the circular velocity at the planetary 
radius. If re is used instead of R, as discussed earlier, then the entry energy is 
referenced to the circular velocity at entry altitude. 
Specification of entry interface conditions (V,, ye, p,) is sufficient to determine 
a particular trajectory subject to the fixed parameters in Eqs. (6.1 1). Trajectory 
solutions take the fonn of velocity and flight-path angle as a function of density, 
the independent variable. The location is obtained, if required, from Eqs. (6.1~) 
and (6.ld), with Eq. (6.2) relating altitude to density. 
Four parameters control the solution of Eqs. (6.1 1): two define the vehicle and 
two define the relevant planetky characteristics. The vehicle parameters are the 
lift-drag ratio LID and the ballistic coefficient rn/SCD. The planetary entry 
environment is determined by the radius R and the atmosphere scale height P-I. 
In the following sections we will examine various solutions obtained by first 
simplifying and then integrating Eqs. (6.1 1). Such solutions implicitly assume the 
controlling parameters given earlier to be constant. Obviously they are not; we 
have devoted considerable discussion to this point both here and in Sec. 5.2. The 
sources of parameter variation can be both natural and artificial. That is, LID and 
the ballistic coefficient will vary considerably over the Mach 25 to 0 entry flight 
regime due to the differing flowfield dynamics. Additionally, however, the 
vehicle LID is the primary control parameter available to the trajectory designer 
for tailoring the entry profile. Substantial mission flexibility can be gained with 
judicious LID control. This cannot be modeled in the closed-form results derived 
from Eqs. (6.11) and offers another reason why detailed trajectory design requires 
a numerical approach. 
The reader should note that it is common practice, particularly when English 
units are employed; to define the ballistic coefficient based on weight, i.e., 
mg/SCD. When this is done, the ballistic coefficient CB will have units of pounds 
per square feet or Newtons per square meters. We avoid this practice and will 
consistently express CB in units of kilograms per square meter. 
Some discussion of the physical significance of the terms in the reduced 
equations is in order, because in later sections we will obtain approximate 
solutions based on assuming a flat Earth, no gravity, small flight-path angle, etc. 
Equations (6.1) clearly show the influence of various terms such as lift, drag, and 
centrifugal force. The physical identity of the various terms is not as clear in the 
reduced form of Eqs. (6.11). 
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.1 1 a) is the reduced drag, and the 
second term (2/p/3R) is the reduced form of the tangential gravitational I 
278 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

In reduced form, the dependent variables are the non-dimensional energy
(V7/gR) and y, with p the independent variable. Because at the surface of the
planet

p GM
BR == = Veire

(6.12)
itis seen that the entry energy is normalized to the circular velocity at the planetary
radius. If 7, is used instead of R, as discussed earlier, then the entry energy is
referenced to the circular velocity at entry altitude.

Specification of entry interface conditions (V,, Ye, Pe) is sufficient to determine
a particular trajectory subject to the fixed parameters in Eqs. (6.11). Trajectory
solutions take the form of velocity and flight-path angle as a function of density,
the independent variable. The location is obtained, if required, from Eqs. (6.1c)
and (6.1d), with Eq. (6.2) relating altitude to density.

Four parameters control the solution of Eqs. (6.11): two define the vehicle and
two define the relevant planetary characteristics. The vehicle parameters are the
lift-drag ratio L/D and the ballistic coefficient m/SCp. The planetary entry
environment is determined by the radius R and the atmosphere scale height B!.

In the following sections we will examine various solutions obtained by first
simplifying and then integrating Eqs. (6.11). Such solutions implicitly assume the
controlling parameters given earlier to be constant. Obviously they are not; we
have devoted considerable discussion to this point both here and in Sec. 5.2. The
sources of parameter variation can be both natural and artificial. That is, L/D and
the ballistic coefficient will vary considerably over the Mach 25 to 0 entry flight
regime due to the differing flowfield dynamics, Additionally, however, the
vehicle L/D is the primary control parameter available to the trajectory designer
for tailoring the entry profile. Substantial mission flexibility can be gained with
judicious L/D control. This cannot be modeled in the closed-form results derived
from Eqs. (6.11) and offers another reason why detailed trajectory design requires
a numerical approach.

The reader should note that it is common practice, particularly when English
units are employed, to define the ballistic coefficient based on weight, i.e.,
mg/SCp. When this is done, the ballistic coefficient Cg will have units of pounds
per square feet or Newtons per square meters. We avoid this practice and will
consistently express Cp in units of kilograms per square meter.

Some discussion of the physical significance of the terms in the reduced
equations is in order, because in later sections we will obtain approximate
solutions based on assuming a flat Earth, no gravity, small flight-path angle, etc.
Equations (6.1) clearly show the influence of various terms such as lift, drag, and
centrifugal force. The physical identity of the various terms is not as clear in the
reduced form of Egs. (6.11).

The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.11a) is the reduced drag, and the
second term (2/pB8R) is the reduced form of the tangential gravitational

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 279 
component, g siny, in Eq. (6.la). Depending on the vehicle configuration and 
flight conditions, one of these terns may be dominant. 
The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.1 1b) is the reduced lift force. 
The term (g - v2/r) in Eq. (6.lb) gives the net normal force contribution of 
gravity and centrifugal acceleration. The corresponding term on the right-hand 
side of Eq. (6.1 1b) is obvious; note, however, that g~/~2 is the gravitational 
term, whereas "1 " is the reduced centrifugal term. 
The surface density p, appears only through Eq. (6.2), which relates density to 
altitude. Care must be exercised in some cases to avoid the introduction of 
unrealistic density values (i.e., those corresponding to negative altitudes) when 
using integrated results from Eqs. (6.1 1). This will be seen in later sections where 
ballistic and skip entry are discussed. 
As pointed out, Eqs. (6.1 1) are not directly integrable in the general case, and, 
if numerical integration is to be employed, there is little reason to use the reduced 
equations. If closed-form results are to be obtained, it is thus necessary to 
simplify the analysis even further. Such simplification yields several possible 
first-order entry trajectory solutions, classically denoted as ballistic, equilibrium 
glide, and skip entry. These solutions may be adequate within a restricted range 
of conditions, but most results are approximate only and are primarily suited to 
initial conceptual design. However, they are very useful in demonstrating the 
types of trajectories that can exist and the parameters that are important in 
determining them. 
6.2.2 Ballistic Entry 
First-order ballistic entry analysis involves two assumptions in addition to 
those thus far employed. By definition of ballistic entry, zero lift is assumed. We 
also employ the approximation 
which results in dropping terms in Eqs. (6.1 1) where PR is in the denominator. 
Some examination of these assumptions is in order. 
The zero-lift approximation is often quite accurate and can be made more so 
when desired. Entry bodies possessing axial symmetry and flown at zero angle of 
attack will fly nominally ballistic trajectories. In a practical vehicle, small 
asymmetries will always produce an offset between the center of mass and the 
center of pressure. This causes the vehicle, unless it is spherical, to fly 
aerodynamically trimmed at some angle of attack, inducing a lift force. However, 
this may be dealt with.by slowly rolling the vehicle during the entry to cancel out 
any forces normal to the velocity vector. For example, the Mercury spacecraft 
was rolled at a nominal 15"/s rate during reentry. 
Substantially higher roll rates are employed for ballistic entry of 
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) warheads. The aerodynamic forces 
ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 279

component, g sin, in Eq. (6.1a). Depending on the vehicle configuration and
flight conditions, one of these terms may be dominant.

The first term on the right-hand side of Eg. (6.11b) is the reduced lift force.
The term (g — v?/ r) in Eq. (6.1b) gives the net normal force contribution of
gravity and centrifugal acceleration. The corresponding term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (6.11b) is obvious; note, however, that gR/ V? is the gravitational
term, whereas “1” is the reduced centrifugal term.

The surface density p, appears only through Eq. (6.2), which relates density to
altitude. Care must be exercised in some cases to avoid the introduction of
unrealistic density values (i.e., those corresponding to negative altitudes) when
using integrated results from Eqs. (6.11). This will be seen in later sections where
ballistic and skip entry are discussed.

As pointed out, Eqs. (6.11) are not directly integrable in the general case, and,
if numerical integration is to be employed, there is little reason to use the reduced
equations. If closed-form results are to be obtained, it is thus necessary to
simplify the analysis even further. Such simplification yields several possible
first-order entry trajectory solutions, classically denoted as ballistic, equilibrium
glide, and skip entry. These solutions may be adequate within a restricted range
of conditions, but most results are approximate only and are primarily suited to
initial conceptual design. However, they are very useful in demonstrating the
types of trajectories that can exist and the parameters that are important in
determining them.

6.2.2 Ballistic Entry

First-order ballistic entry analysis involves two assumptions in addition to
those thus far employed. By definition of ballistic entry, zero lift is assumed. We
also employ the approximation

1
BR
which results in dropping terms in Eqs. (6.11) where BR is in the denominator.
Some examination of these assumptions is in order.

The zero-lift approximation is often quite accurate and can be made more so
when desired. Entry bodies possessing axial symmetry and flown at zero angle of
attack will fly nominally ballistic trajectories. In a practical vehicle, small
asymmetries will always produce an offset between the center of mass and the
center of pressure. This causes the vehicle, unless it is spherical, to fly
aerodynamically trimmed at some angle of attack, inducing a lift force. However,
this may be dealt with by slowly rolling the vehicle during the entry to cancel out
any forces normal to the velocity vector. For example, the Mercury spacecraft
was rolled at a nominal 15°/s rate during reentry.

Substantially higher roll rates are employed for ballistic entry of
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) warheads. The aerodynamic forces

280 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
J generated in this case can give rise to a significantly more complex entry 
trajectory. Such topics are considerably beyond the scope of this text. platus7 
gives an excellent summary of the state of the art in ballistic entry analysis. 
The second approximation is somewhat less valid. Although it is true that PR 
is typically large (approximately 900 for the Earth), this does not justify dropping 
all terms in Eqs. (6.11) where it appears in the denominator. In particular, 
(2/pPR) represents the reduced gravitational force along the trajectory. By 
omitting it, we assume that the drag force dominates, which is not always true. 
The drag is always small and usually comparable to the tangential gravitational 
force at the entry interface. Toward the end of the entry phase, when the velocity 
becomes small, (2/pPR) will again dominate, and neglecting it will lead to 
inaccuracy. 
From the preceding comments it is seen that our second ballistic entry 
assumption corresponds to neglecting gravity with respect to drag in Eq. (6. la) 
and to neglecting the difference between gravitational and centrifugal force in 
Eq. (6.lb). Thus, first-order ballistic entry may be viewed as a zero-g, flat-Earth 
solution. 
In any case, if terms containing (l/j?R) are dropped and zero lift is assumed, 
Eq. (6.1 1b) integrates immediately to yield 
cos y = cos ye (6.14) 
i-e., the flight-path angle remains constant at the entry value. 
The validity of this result is obviously somewhat questionable. Intuition and 
experience suggest 'that for shallow entry angles, such as those that are required 
for manned flight, the vehicle will undergo a lengthy high-altitude deceleration 
and then, its energy depleted, nose over into a nearly vertical trajectory. Also, the 
shallow entry angle produces a lengthier entry, with consequently more time for 
gravity to curve the flight path. As discussed earlier, this is the problem with 
neglecting (l/PR) in Eqs. (6.11). Nonetheless, when entry occurs at a reasonably 
steep angle, as is typical for an ICBM, the flight path is indeed nearly straight. 
This is graphically illustrated in numerous time exposure photographs of entry 
body flight tests. ~shle~~ suggests that the surprisingly shallow value of 
-ye > 5" is dkient to yield a good match to the ballistic entry assumptions. 
Equation (6.1 la) may be integrated subject to our assumptions to yield 
for the velocity as a function of altitude and entry flight-path angle. Of possibly 
greater interest is the derivative of velocity, the acceleration, which can be shown 
to have a peak value of

generated in this case can give rise to a significantly more complex entry
trajectory. Such topics are considerably beyond the scope of this text. Platus’
gives an excellent summary of the state of the art in ballistic entry analysis.

The second approximation is somewhat less valid. Although it is true that BR
is typically large (approximately 900 for the Earth), this does not justify dropping
all terms in Eqs. (6.11) where it appears in the denominator. In particular,
(2/pBR) represents the reduced gravitational force along the trajectory. By
omitting it, we assume that the drag force dominates, which is not always true.
The drag is always small and usually comparable to the tangential gravitational
force at the entry interface. Toward the end of the entry phase, when the velocity
becomes small, (2/pBR) will again dominate, and neglecting it will lead to
inaccuracy.

From the preceding comments it is seen that our second ballistic entry
assumption corresponds to neglecting gravity with respect to drag in Eq. (6.1a)
and to neglecting the difference between gravitational and centrifugal force in
Eq. (6.1b). Thus, first-order ballistic entry may be viewed as a zero-g, flat-Earth
solution.

In any case, if terms containing (1/8R) are dropped and zero lift is assumed,
Eq. (6.11b) integrates immediately to yield

cos Y = cos ¥, (6.14)

i.e., the flight-path angle remains constant at the entry value.

The validity of this result is obviously somewhat questionable. Intuition and
experience suggest ‘that for shallow entry angles, such as those that are required
for manned flight, the vehicle will undergo a lengthy high-altitude deceleration
and then, its energy depleted, nose over into a nearly vertical trajectory. Also, the
shallow entry angle produces a lengthier entry, with consequently more time for
gravity to curve the flight path. As discussed earlier, this is the problem with
neglecting (1/AR) in Eqs. (6.11). Nonetheless, when entry occurs at a reasonably
steep angle, as is typical for an ICBM, the flight path is indeed nearly straight.
This is graphically illustrated in numerous time exposure photographs of entry
body flight tests. Ashley® suggests that the surprisingly shallow value of
— Ye > 5° is sufficient to yield a good match to the ballistic entry assumptions.

Equation (6.11a) may be integrated subject to our assumptions to yield

1 SC;
V=V, exp| (55) (2) (=) exp pi] (6.15)

order analysis provides a very poor model of the entry in such a case. The second- 
order analysis by chapman? summarized in Fig. 6.2, shows that entry from low 
circular Earth orbit has an irreducible deceleration load of about 8g, which occurs 
for flight-path angles between 0 and -lo. For flight-path angles steeper than 
about - 5", the theories are in reasonable agreement as to trend, though the first- 
order theory underpredicts the deceleration by about lg. 
Figure 6.3 shows a typical shallow angle ballistic entry solution, obtained by 
numerically integrating Eqs. (6.1). The sharp peak in entry deceleration and the 
rather high value of that peak are characteristic of ballistic entry. As indicated 
earlier, the peak is seriously underestimated in this case by Eq. (6.16), which 
predicts a 3.6g maximum deceleration. 
Note also in Fig. 6.3 the difference between the inertial and Earth-relative 
entry speed. The Earth-relative (hence atmosphere-relative) speed should be 
employed for V,; however, the approximations inherent in a first-order solution 
are such that correcting for atmosphere-relative velocity may not be important. If 
used, the appropriate correction is

6.2.3 Gliding Entry

In contrast to ballistic entry, first-order gliding entry analysis assumes that the
vehicle generates sufficient lift to maintain a lengthy hypersonic glide at a small
flight-path angle. Clearly this is an idealization. Substantial lift is readily obtained
at hypersonic speeds, and it is possible to achieve shallow-angle gliding flight
over major portions of the entry trajectory. However, a practical vehicle
configuration for an extended hypersonic glide will be poorly suited to flight at
low supersonic and subsonic speeds. Toward tlie end of its flight, such a vehicle
must fly at a steeper angle to maintain adequate airspeed for approach and landing
control.

This is readily illustrated by the space shuttle entry profile.'!~!? The entry
guidance phase is initiated at the entry interface altitude of 122 km with the
flight-path angle typically about — 1.2°. It terminates when the shuttle reaches an
Earth-relative speed of about 760 m/s (Mach 2.5), at an altitude of approximately
24 km and a distance to the landing site of about 110 km. This phase of flight
covers a total range of roughly 8500 km, with the average flight-path angle on the
order of — 1°. The shuttle’s hypersonic glide phase is considerably longer than
was the case for preceding manned vehicles.

Upon completion of entry guidance, the terminal area energy management
(TAEM) phase is initiated. The goal of this procedure is to deliver the orbiter to
the runway threshold at the desired altitude and speed for approach and landing.

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 285 
This phase of flight cowrs a range of 110 krn while descending through 24 km of 
altitude, at an average flight-path angle of about - 12", an order of magnitude 
steeper than that for the hypersonic phase. 
The results of this section, although inadequate in the terminal flight regime, 
may well be appropriate for the major portion of a gliding entry. In keeping with 
' the small angle assumption noted earlier, we assume sin -- y, cos y -- 1, and 
hence d(cos y)/dp zx 0. With these approximations Eq. (6.1 1b) is reduced to an 
algebraic equation for energy as a function of density: 
or, from Eq. (6.2), 
Equation (6.21) may be differentiated with respect to p and substituted into 
Eq. (6.1 la) to solve for the flight-path angle. Consistent with the assumption of 
small y, we neglect the tangential component of gravitational acceleration and 
obtain 
Note that, although the flight-path angle y is assumed to be small and its cosine 
constant, y is not itself assumed constant. 
Equation (6.22) is an equilibrium glide result, where the gravitational force 
cancels the sum of the centrifugal and lift forces. This is readily seen by noting 
the physical identity of the various terms in Eq. (6.11b). Of course, the 
equilibrium is not exact because the derivative term in Eq. (6.11b) is not 
identically zero. For this reason the trajectory given by Eq. (6.22) is sometimes, 
and more correctly, referred to as a pseudoequilibrium glide. 
To obtain the acceleration along the trajectory, note from Eq. (6.la), 
where again we neglect the gravitational acceleration along the flight path.

may well be appropriate for the major portion of a gliding entry. In keeping with

‘the small angle assumption noted earlier, we assume sin ~ y, cos y =~ 1, and

the peak load is Sg, substantially lower than for a Mercury-style ballistic entry at 
the same flight-path angle. For the shuttle, which flies a major portion of its entry 
profile with a hypersonic L/D of about 1.1, Eq. (6.25) predicts essentially a 1g 
reentry. These results are consistent with flight experience. 
By integrating the velocity along the entry trajectory, the total range of the 
equilibrium glide is found to be 
Clearly, the greatest range is obtained when entry is performed at the maximum 
vehicle LID. 
As an example, consider a space shuttle entry at an atmosphere-relative speed 
of 7.5 km/s with a hypersonic LID of 1.1 assumed. With these representative 
values, Eq. (6.26) yields a predicted range of about 8000 km, in good agreement 
with flight experience. This may be somewhat fortuitous, because the shuttle in 
fact uses substantial lift modulation during entry to achieve landing point control. 
This is shown in Fig. 6.4 for the STS-2 reentry.l4 Nonetheless, an LID of 1.1 
closely approximates the high-altitude, high-speed portion of the entry, and it is 
this portion that obviously has the most effect on total range. 
Equation (6.26) is of limited utility when the entry speed approaches the 
reference circular velocity. In this case the argument of the logarithm is almost 
singular and hence extremely sensitive to the value of the entry velocity. This 
reflects a limitation of the first-order theory rather than any real physical effect. 
Equation (6.26) is also invalid for the supercircular entry, because the logarithm 
becomes imaginary in this case. 
Figure 6.5 shows an entry trajectory simulation result for the British horizontal 
takeoff and landing (HOTOL) vehicle concept. HOTOL was a mid-1980s design 
for an unmanned, reusable, single-stage-to-orbit vehicle intended for runway 
launch and landing. Because it was to be quite light, it needed to fly a high, 
shallow-angle gliding entry to minimize peak dynamic and thermal loads. As 
shown, the result is an entry profile that closely approximates the 
pseudoequilibrium glide trajectory during the high-speed portion of the flight. 
The first-order equilibrium glide solution given earlier is due to Eggers et 211.'' 
and is discussed by later authors, including ~shle~~ and Vinh et al.5 As with 
ballistic entry, higher order solutions are available but in our view are as 
annoying to implement as a complete numerical solution and yield little 
additional insight compared to the first-order theory.

the peak load is 5g, substantially lower than for a Mercury-style ballistic entry at
the same flight-path angle. For the shuttle, which flies a major portion of its entry
profile with a hypersonic L/D of about 1.1, Eq. (6.25) predicts essentially a 1g
reentry. These results are consistent with flight experience.

Clearly, the greatest range is obtained when entry is performed at the maximum

As an example, consider a space shuttle entry at an atmosphere-relative speed
of 7.5 km/s with a hypersonic L/D of 1.1 assumed. With these representative
values, Eq. (6.26) yields a predicted range of about 8000 km, in good agreement
with flight experience. This may be somewhat fortuitous, because the shuttle in
fact uses substantial lift modulation during entry to achieve landing point control.
This is shown in Fig. 6.4 for the STS-2 reentry.'* Nonetheless, an L/D of 1.1
closely approximates the high-altitude, high-speed portion of the entry, and it is
this portion that obviously has the most effect on total range.

Equation (6.26) is of. limited utility when the entry speed approaches the
reference circular velocity. In this case the argument of the logarithm is almost
singular and hence extremely sensitive to the value of the entry velocity. This
reflects a limitation of the first-order theory rather than any real physical effect.
Equation (6.26) is also invalid for the supercircular entry, because the logarithm

Figure 6.5 shows an entry trajectory simulation result for the British horizontal

for an unmanned, reusable, single-stage-to-orbit vehicle intended for runway
launch and landing. Because it was to be quite light, it needed to fly a high,

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 289 
This type of trajectory offers considerable flexibility in the control of high- 
speed entry. For example, at lunar return speeds of about 11 km/s, the kinetic 
energy to be dissipated is about twice that of a typical low-Earth-orbit entry. This 
results in a very challenging thermal control problem, especially if the entry is 
required to occur in a single pass. With the skip entry, however, the vehicle can 
reduce its velocity sufficiently on its fist pass to guarantee Earth capture. The 
brief suborbital lob allows radiative cooling and is followed by a second entry 
phase at lower speed. 
Skip entry is also useful for range control and allows the vehicle to land in 
places that could not be reached via a single entry phase. Again, lunar return 
provides an example, this time in connection with the Soviet Zond series of 
unmanned lunar probes. Astrodynamic constraints forced the initial entry point 
for the return vehicles to occur at latitudes well to the south of the USSR. The

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 289

This type of trajectory offers considerable flexibility in the control of high-
speed entry. For example, at lunar return speeds of about 11 km/s, the kinetic
energy to be dissipated is about twice that of a typical low-Earth-orbit entry. This
results in a very challenging thermal control problem, especially if the entry is
required to occur in a single pass. With the skip entry, however, the vehicle can
reduce its velocity sufficiently on its first pass to guarantee Earth capture. The
brief suborbital lob allows radiative cooling and is followed by a second entry
phase at lower speed.

Skip entry is also useful for range control and allows the vehicle to land in
places that could not be reached via a single entry phase. Again, lunar return
provides an example, this time in connection with the Soviet Zond series of
unmanned lunar probes. Astrodynamic constraints forced the initial entry point
for the return vehicles to occur at latitudes well to the south of the USSR. The
entry vehicles were brought in over the Indian Ocean and, following a
pronounced skip, were targeted to land in the USSR.

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 291. 
As an example, consider an Apollo-type entry with a vehicle LID of 0.30, a 
lunar return speed of 11 km/s, and an atmospheric scale height of 7.1 km. Using 
the 12g maximum acceleration design limit selected for Apollo, the steepest 
allowed entry angle is found from Ey. (6.36) to be - 4.8". Assuming circular exit 
velocity to be the maximum acceptable (the vehicle will not go into orbit because 
the flight-path angle is nonzero at the exit interface, which is itself too low for a 
stable orbit), we find from Eq. (6.34) that the shallowest possible entry is - 2.9". 
An indication of the accuracy and limitations of the first-order skip entry 
analysis presented here is obtained by noting that the Apollo 11 entry was 
initiated at a velocity-and flight-path angle of 11 km/s and - 6.5", respectivdy. 
The 12g undershoot (steep entry) boundary was - 7" and the overshoot (shallow-

6.2.5 Cross-Range Maneuvers

Thus far we have assumed that the entry trajectory lies in the plane of the
initial orbit. However, if a lifting entry vehicle is banked (lift vector rotated out of

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 293 
theJvertical plane defined by r, V), then a force normal to the original orbit plane 
is generated and the vehicle flies a three-dimensional trajectory. This may be 
done with both gliding and skip entry profiles as discussed earlier. 
The dynamics of three-dimensional flight within the atmosphere are beyond 
the intended scope of this text, and we will not engage in a detailed study of 
lateral maneuvers. As with the planar trajectories discussed previously, however, 
first-order results are available1' that yield considerable insight into the effect of 
banking maneuvers. Because cross-range control is often of interest even in the 
preliminary stages of entry vehicle and trajectory design, we will consider here 
some results of first-order three-dimensional entry analysis. 
It is usually of interest to examine the maximum "footprint," or envelope of 
possible landing points, to which an entry vehicle can be steered. In-plane or 
down-range control for a lifting vehicle is attained through modulation of the lift- 
to-drag ratio. As seen in Eq. (6.26), maximum range is attained with flight at the 
highest available LID. A landing at lesser range can be achieved by flying 
energy-dissipating maneuvers up and down in the entry plane, or back and forth 
across the initial plane. Cross-range maneuvers that do not cancel result in a 
lateral offset of the landing point, at some expense in downtrack range. 
To effect a lateral maneuver, a lifting entry vehicle must bank to obtain a 
turning force normal to the initial plane and, upon attaining the desired heading 
change, reduce the bank angle again to zero. For maximum lateral range, the bank 
angle modulation must be performed in such a way that the downtrack range is 
not unduly reduced, or else the cross-range maneuver will not have time to 
achieve its full effect. There will thus be an optimum bank angle history that 
allows the maximum possible cross-range maneuver for a given down-range 
landing point. 
For analytical purposes, the optimum, time-varying, bank angle history must 
be replaced by an equivalent constant value that provides similar results while 
allowing integration of the equations of motion. Although justified by the mean 
value theorem of integral calculus, this procedure renders invalid any 
consideration of the trajectory history, preserving only the maximum capability 
information. If in addition we assume an equilibrium glide with small changes in 
heading angle, first-order (~~~ers'') and second-order (Vinh et al.') results for 
maximum lateral range may be obtained. To first order, the angular cross range is

6.2.6 Loh’s Second-Order Solution

The first-order atmospheric entry results presented earlier adequately
demonstrate the various entry profiles that can be obtained for particular initial
conditions and vehicle parameters. However, these solutions have two important
limitations that preclude their use for anything more sophisticated than initial
conceptual design.

The obvious restriction of the first-order solutions is their accuracy. All results
derived thus far incorporate the assumptions of constant gravitational force,
strictly exponential atmosphere and fixed reference altitude. These assumptions
were discussed in Sec. 6.1 and contribute a total error on the order of 5%. An
additional modeling error in the integrated results is the assumption of constant
vehicle ballistic coefficient and L/D. ;

However, the more troublesome aspect of the first-order theory is the fact that
one must know in advance what type of entry is under consideration. For
example, the vehicle is assumed to be in either a steep ballistic or a shallow
gliding trajectory. Shallow-angle ballistic entry and semiballistic entry at low but
nonzero L/D do not readily fit into either category. A first-order theory that can
address a wide range of entry interface conditions and vehicle parameters is not
available.

As mentioned, second-order theories exist. We have also stated that in our
view the implementation of higher order solutions to approximate equations is
more troublesome and has less benefit than direct numerical integration of the
basic governing equations. There is one possible exception to this policy that is
worthy of consideration here, and that is Loh’s empirically derived second-order
theory.’? We include a brief discussion of the theory more for its pedagogical
value than for its practical utility.

Recall in Eq. (6.11b) that the term

_ {1 \fgR
A= (<a) (5 - 1) cos y (6.39)

represents the difference between the gravitational and centrifugal force normal
to the entry flight path. The various first-order solutions assume either that this
term is zero (ballistic, skip) or that the rate of change of the flight-path angle is
small (equilibrium glide). Another possible assumption, intuitively reasonable
but discovered by Loh through a comprehensive numerical investigation, is that
A is a nonzero constant throughout entry. Modeling errors are then due to

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 297 
departures from this value rather than to complete omission of the term, and are 
of second order. 
With Loh's assumption of constant A, Eq. (6.1 1b) becomes 
d( cOs 7) 2 (+) (+) (g) - A 
dp

6.3 Fundamentals of Entry Heating

Up to this point we have considered only the particle dynamics of atmospheric
entry, wherein the vehicle is completely characterized by its L/D and ballistic
coefficient. This determines the flight trajectory and allows assessment of the
vehicle acceleration and dynamic pressure loads, the down-range and cross-range
travel, and the sensitivity of these quantities to the entry conditions and vehicle
parameters.

Of equal importance are the thermal loads imposed on the vehicle during

entry. These are of two types: the total heat load and the instantaneous heating
rate. The total heat load is obviously a concern in that the average vehicle
temperature will increase with the energy input. The allowed heating rate, either
local or body-averaged, is a concern because of the thermal gradient induced

I where 
q = power per unit area, w/m2 
K = thermal conductivity, W/mK 
VT = gradient of temperature, K/m 
In materials with a nonzero coefficient of thermal expansion, a temperature 
gradient causes differential expansion and mechanical stress in the vehicle wall 
material. 
Tradeoffs between allowed heating rate and total heat load are often necessary. 
Sustained high-energy flight at high altitude (e.g., gliding entry) reduces the 
instantaneous heating rate but, by extending the duration of the flight, may 
unacceptably increase the total heat absorbed. A more rapid, high-drag entry 
usually reduces the total energy 
input at the expense of incurring a very high local heating rate and may in 
addition result in unacceptable dynamic loads. 
Entry vehicle heating results from the dissipation of the initial total (kinetic 
plus potential) energy through two heat transfer mechanisms, convection and 
radiation. Convective heating occurs when the air, heated by passage through a 
strong bow shock in front of the vehicle, bathes the wall in a hot fluid stream. If 
the air is hot enough, significant thermal radiation will occur as well. Radiative 
heat transfer is important when the entry velocity is greater than about 10 km/s 
and may be significant at considerably lower speeds. 
Peak aerodynamic heating will usually occur in stagnation point regions, such 
as on a blunt nose or wing leading edge. However, turbulent flow along the 
vehicle afterbody can under some conditions produce a comparable or greater 
heat flux. Conversely, delayed onset of turbulence (i.e., turbulent transition at a 
higher than expected Reynolds number) can produce a substantially cooler aft 
body flow than expected. 
Thermal control is a major entry vehicle design challenge. As ~e~an~ notes, 
the specific kinetic energy that is dissipated during entry from low Earth orbit is 
about 3 x 10' J/kg. This is sufficient to vaporize a heat shield composed of pure 
carbon (h, = 6 x lo7 J/kg) and equal to half the initial vehicle mass. If this is to 
be prevented, then the major portion of the entry kinetic and potential energy 
must be deflected to the atmosphere rather than the vehicle. A good 
aerothegnodynarnic design will allow only a few percent of this energy to 
reach .the vehicle.

about 3 x 10’ J/kg. This is sufficient to vaporize a heat shield composed of pure

6.3.1 Thermal Protection Techniques

The design and analysis of an entry vehicle and flight profile to meet the
thermal protection requirement is a multidiscipline task involving aerodynamics,

300 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
t 
chemistry, flight mechanics, structural analysis, and materials science. Three 
basic approaches to entry vehicle thermal control have evolved: heat sinking, 
radiative cooling, and ablative shielding. 
The heat sink technique, as the name implies, uses a large mass of material 
with a high melting point and high heat capacity to absorb the entry heat load. 
The initial Mercury spacecraft design utilized this approach, employing a 
beryllium blunt body heat shield. This design was used on the unmanned tests and 
on the first manned Mercury-Redstone suborbital flights. However, the increased 
system weight for protection against the order-of-magnitude higher orbital entry 
heat load forced the use of an ablative shield on the subsequent orbital missions. 
. The second manned suborbital mission tested the ablative heat shield. This . 
weight penalty is a typical and important limitation of the heat sink approach to 
entry thermal control. 
The principle of radiative cooling is to allow the outer skin of the vehicle to 
become, literally, red hot due to the convectively transferred heat from the 
flowfield around the vehicle. Blackbody radiation, primarily in the infrared 
portion of the spectrum, then transports energy from the vehicle to the 
surrounding atmosphere. Convective heating to the vehicle is proportional to the 
temperature difference between the fluid and the wall, whereas the energy 
radiated away is in proportion to the difference in the fourth powers of the fluid 
and wall temperatures. The net result is that thermal equilibrium can be reached 
at a relatively modest skin temperature provided that the rate of heating is kept 
low enough to maintain near-equilibrium conditions. 
Radiative cooling obviously requires excellent insulation between the 
intensely hot outer shell and the internal vehicle payload and structure. This is 
exactly the purpose of the shuttle tiles, the main element of the shuttle thermal 
protection system. Essentially a porous matrix of silica (quartz) fibers, these tiles 
have such low thermal conductivity that they can literally be held in the hand on 
one side and heated with a blowtorch on the other. 
As stated, radiative cooling relies on equilibrium, or near-equilibrium, 
between the entry vehicle and its surroundings to shed the absorbed heat load. 
This is most easily achieved in a lengthy, high-altitude gliding entry where the 
instantaneous heating rate is minimized as the speed is slowly reduced. The. 
vehicle aerodynamic design (ballistic coefficient and LID), the entry flight 
trajectory, and the heat shield material selection are intimately related when 
radiative cooling is used. This complicates the design problem; however, 
significant mass savings are possible when a system-level approach is taken.21 
A potential problem with an insulated, radiatively cooled vehicle having a 
lengthy flight time is that ultimately some heat will soak through. to the 
underlying structure. Coolant fluid may thus need to be circulated through the 
vehicle so that this energy can be radiated away to a portion of the surroundings, 
such as the aft region, which is cooler. This can occur even if the flight time is 
sufficiently short that in-flight cooling is not required. Such is the case with the

chemistry, flight mechanics, structural analysis, and materials science. Three
basic approaches to entry vehicle thermal control have evolved: heat sinking,
radiative cooling, and ablative shielding.

The heat sink technique, as the name implies, uses a large mass of material
with a high melting point and high heat capacity to absorb the entry heat load.
The initial Mercury spacecraft design utilized this approach, employing a
beryllium blunt body heat shield. This design was used on the unmanned tests and
on the first manned Mercury-Redstone suborbital flights. However, the increased
system weight for protection against the order-of-magnitude higher orbital entry
heat load forced the use of an ablative shield on the subsequent orbital missions.
The second manned suborbital mission tested the ablative heat shield. This
weight penalty is a typical and important limitation of the heat sink approach to
entry thermal control.

The principle of radiative cooling is to allow the outer skin of the vehicle to
become, literally, red hot due to the convectively transferred heat from the
flowfield around the vehicle. Blackbody radiation, primarily in the infrared
portion of the spectrum, then transports energy from the vehicle to the
surrounding atmosphere. Convective heating to the vehicle is proportional to the
temperature difference between the fluid and the wall, whereas the energy
radiated away is in proportion to the difference in the fourth powers of the fluid
and wall temperatures. The net result is that thermal equilibrium can be reached
at a relatively modest skin temperature provided that the rate of heating is kept
low enough to maintain near-equilibrium conditions.

Radiative cooling obviously requires excellent insulation between the

exactly the purpose of the shuttle tiles, the main element of the shuttle thermal
protection system. Essentially a porous matrix of silica (quartz) fibers, these tiles
have such low thermal conductivity that they can literally be held in the hand on

As stated, radiative cooling relies on equilibrium, or near-equilibrium,
between the entry vehicle and its surroundings to shed the absorbed heat load.
This is most easily achieved in a lengthy, high-altitude gliding entry where the
instantaneous heating rate is minimized as the speed is slowly reduced. The.
vehicle aerodynamic design (ballistic coefficient and L/D), the entry flight
trajectory, and the heat shield material selection are intimately related when
radiative cooling is used. This complicates the design problem; however,
significant mass savings are possible when a system-level approach is taken.!

A potential problem with an insulated, radiatively cooled vehicle having a
lengthy flight time is that ultimately some heat will soak through: to the
underlying structure. Coolant fluid may thus need to be circulated through the
vehicle so that this energy can be radiated away to a portion of the surroundings,
such as the aft region, which is cooler. This can occur even if the flight time is
sufficiently short that in-flight cooling is not required. Such is the case with the

ATMOSPHERIC ENTRY 301 
shuttle, which must be connected to cooling lines from ground support equipment 
if postflight damage to the aluminum structure is to be prevented. 
Although heat sinking is best suited to a brief, high-drag entry and radiative 
cooling is more appropriate for a gliding trajectory, ablative cooling offers 
considerably more flexibility in the flight profile definition. ~blative' cooling is 
also typically the least massive approach to entry heat protection. These 
advantages accrue at the expense of vehicle (or at least heat shield) reusability, 
which is a pronounced benefit of the other techniques. 
Ablative cooling occurs when the heat shield material, commonly a fiberglass- 
resin matrix, sublimes under the entry heat load. When the sublimed material is 
swept away in the flowfield, the vehicle is cooled. This process can produce well 
over lo7 J/kg of effective energy removal. Ablative cooling has been the method 
of choice for most entry vehicles, including the manned Mercury, Gemini, and 
Apollo vehicles. 
6.3.2 Entry Heatlng Analysis 
From the theory of viscous fluid flowz2 it is known that the flowfield about an 
atmospheric entry vehicle develops a thin boundary layer close to the body to 
which viscous effects, including skin friction and heat transfer, are confined. The 
heat flux to the wall is proportional to the local temperature gradient, 
where y is the coordinate normal to the wall. The temperature gradient is obtained 
from the boundary-layer flowfield solution, determined from the boundary-layer 
edge properties and wall conditions. The edge conditions in turn follow from the 
inviscid solution for the flow over the entry vehicle. The vehicle heat transfer 
analysis is thus dependent on knowledge of the flowfield. 
The right-hand equality in Eq. (6.50) implies that, in the steady state, iteration 
between the convective and radiative heat flux equations will be necessary to fix 
the equilibrium wall temperature. 
The difficulty of obtaining an accurate solution for the high-speed flowfield 
around an entry vehicle can hardly be overstated. The fluid is a chemically 
reacting gas, possibly not in equilibrium, probably ionized, and with potentially 
significant radiative energy transfer. Vehicle surface properties such as roughness 
and wall catalycity influence the flowfield and heat transfer analysis. 
We note in passing that this partially ionized flowfield is the "plasma sheath" 
that interferes with air-to-ground communication during major portions of entry 
flight. This was the cause of the "communications blackout7' familiar to readers 
who recall the early Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo manned flights. The advent of

of choice for most entry vehicles, including the manned Mercury, Gemini, and

6.3.2 Entry Heating Analysis

From the theory of viscous fluid flow” it is known that the flowfield about an
atmospheric entry vehicle develops a thin boundary layer close to the body to
which viscous effects, including skin friction and heat transfer, are confined. The
heat flux to the wall is proportional to the local temperature gradient,

where y is the coordinate normal to the wall. The temperature gradient is obtained
from the boundary-layer flowfield solution, determined from the boundary-layer

inviscid solution for the flow over the entry vehicle. The vehicle heat transfer
analysis is thus dependent on knowledge of the flowfield.

The right-hand equality in Eq. (6.50) implies that, in the steady state, iteration

the space shuttle can generally complete the link to a TDRSS satellite. However, 
the roll maneuvers necessary for shuttle landing point control can, and 
periodically do, disrupt communications during the entry phase. 
The entry flight regime is equally demanding of an experimental approach. It 
is at present impossible. to conduct a wind-tunnel experiment that simultaneously 
provides both Mach and Reynolds numbers appropriate to entry flight. Thus, the 
space shuttle received the first true test of its performance during its first fight, a 
potentially hazardous situation, because, unlike its predecessors, the shuttle was 
not flight tested in an unmanned configuration. 
A recurrent theme in this text is that recourse to all available analytical 
sophistication is desirable, even essential, prior to critical design and 
development. However, preliminary design and mission feasibility assessment 
would be virtually impossible without the use of simpler, less accurate, 
techniques. Accordingly, we rely on an approach to entry heating analysis first 
given by Allen and ~~~ers." This approach assumes the primary source of 
energy input to be convective heating fiom the laminar boundary-layer flow over 
the entry vehicle. In this case, the local heating rate as given by Eq. (6.50) may be

delayed onset of turbulent flow as compared with subscale wind-tunnel test

of flights, and in one case (STS-73) as early as Mach 19. Early onset of turbulent 
transition has been attributed to excessive surface roughness, and in particular to 
partially dislodged "gap filler" material, placed between the shuttle thermal 
protection tiles to impede hot gas flow in these interstices. The gap fillers can 
apparently loosen in flight and intrude into the boundary-layer flow, causing.early 
transition and, in some cases, unexpected damage to the thermal protection

hypersonic entry vehicle designs. It is necessary to ensure that the combination of 
reaction control thrusters and aerodynamic surfaces is capable of exerting 
sufficient control authority, for a sufficient length of time, to overcome the lateral

31 0 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Flat-plate theory is useful in aerodynamics because most portions of a flight 
vehicle are of a scale such that the local body radius of curvature dwarfs the 
boundary-layer thickness. Thus, most of the body appears locally as a flat plate, 
and good approximate results for skin friction can be obtained by ignoring those 
portions, small by definition, which do not. This assumption can be invalid for 
flight at very high altitude, where the reduced density lowers the Reynolds 
number and produces a thicker boundary layer. 
Equation (6.83) can be extended to high-speed, hence compressible, flow 
through the reference-temperature approach.22 It is found that, in the worst case 
(adiabatic wall), CF/,/(Red varies from 1.328 at low speed to approximately 
0.65 at Mach 20. Compressibility thus has an important but not overwhelming 
effect on skin friction coefficient 'and, for entry heating calculations such as 
presented here, may with some justification be ignored or included in an ad hoc 
fashion. In any case, the use of the low-speed value is conservative from an entry 
heating viewpoint. 
6.3.6 Stagnation Point Heating 
Both the total heat load and the body-averaged heating rate are important in 
entry analysis, because either may constrain the trajectory. Their relative 
importance will depend on the entry profile and -vehicle parameters, and, as we 
have mentioned, relief from one is usually obtained by aggravating the other. 
Of equal importance is the maximum local heating rate imposed on any part of 
the entry vehicle, which determines the most severe local thermal protection 
requirement. With the possible exception of local afterbody hot spots due to 
turbulent effects and shock-boundary-layea interactions, the body heating rate is 
maximized at the stagnation point. Any realistic vehicle design will have a blunt 
nose or wing leading edge, and this will be a region of stagnation flow, shown 
schematically in Fig. 6.12. 
The stagnation region behind a strong normal shock is one of particularly 
intense heating. For example, at an entry speed of Mach 25 the perfect gas shock 
tables2* yield Tt2/Tl = 126, where Tl is the freestream static temperature and Tn 
is the stagnation temperature behind the shock. Assuming Tl = 166 K for the 
standard atmosphere at 80 km, the total temperature behind the shock is 
20,900 K! For comparison, the surface temperature of the sun is approximately 
5780 K. 
Such extreme temperatures are of course not attained. The previous 
calculation assumes the atmosphere to be a calorically perfect gas for which 
the enthalpy and temperature are related by 
where the heat capacity C, is a constant, 1005 J/kg.K for air. In fact, a major

Flat-plate theory is useful in aerodynamics because most portions of a flight
vehicle are of a scale such that the local body radius of curvature dwarfs the
boundary-layer thickness. Thus, most of the body appears locally as a flat plate,
and good approximate results for skin friction can be obtained by ignoring those

flight at very high altitude, where the reduced density lowers the Reynolds
number and produces a thicker boundary layer.

Equation (6.83) can be extended to high-speed, hence compressible, flow
through the reference-temperature approach.” It is found that, in the worst case
(adiabatic wall), Cr/./(Re,) varies from 1.328 at low speed to approximately
0.65 at Mach 20. Compressibility thus has an important but not overwhelming
effect on skin friction coefficient ‘and, for entry heating calculations such as
presented here, may with some justification be ignored or included in an ad hoc
fashion. In any case, the use of the low-speed value is conservative from an entry
heating viewpoint.

6.3.6 Stagnation Point Heating

Both the total heat load and the body-averaged heating rate are important in
entry analysis, because either may constrain the trajectory. Their relative
importance will depend on the entry profile and vehicle parameters, and, as we
have mentioned, relief from one is usually obtained by aggravating the other.

Of equal importance is the maximum local heating rate imposed on any part of
the entry vehicle, which determines the most severe local thermal protection
requirement. With the possible exception of local afterbody hot spots due to
turbulent effects and shock—boundary-layer interactions, the body heating rate is
maximized at the stagnation point. Any realistic vehicle design will have a blunt
nose or wing leading edge, and this will be a region of stagnation flow, shown
schematically in Fig. 6.12.

The stagnation region behind a strong normal shock is one of particularly
intense heating. For example, at an entry speed of Mach 25 the perfect gas shock
tables”* yield T,./T, = 126, where 7; is the freestream static temperature and 7;
is the stagnation temperature behind the shock. Assuming 7, = 166 K for the
standard atmosphere at 80km, the total temperature behind the shock is
20,900 K! For comparison, the surface temperature of the sun is approximately
5780 K.

Such extreme temperatures are of course not attained. The previous
calculation assumes the atmosphere to be a calorically perfect gas for which
the enthalpy and temperature are related by

h=C,T (6.84)

where the heat capacity C, is a constant, 1005 J/kg-K for air. In fact, a major

reaches a peak temperature of approximately 1650 K (2500"~).~~ 
The preceding example is interesting and informative regarding attempts to 
predict individual flowfield properties for high-speed and therefore high-energy 
flows. A cautionary note should be added, however. The wall heat flux q, is the 
parameter of importance in entry vehicle design and is driven by the total 
enthalpy difference (H,- H,) between the wall and the outer edge of the 
boundary layer. The temperature difference is not the relevant parameter, despite 
what Eq. (6.50) would imply. For a calorically perfect gas, where Eq. (6.84) 
applies, no distinction between temperature and enthalpy need be made. In a 
chemically reacting gas, dissociation and ionization will alter the balance 
between effective heat capacity and temperature and thus significantly affect the 
flowfield. However, the net effect on the boundary-layer flowfield total enthalpy 
difference (Hoe- Hw) and hence the wall heat flux may be small. 
The implication is that the neglect of real gas effects, although horrifying to a 
physical gas dynamicist, may be fairly reasonable for our purposes. This is 
especially true when chemical equilibrium exists in the boundary-layer flowfield, 
an approximation that is reasonable in the stagnation region. Also, the 
assumption of a non-equilibrium boundary-layer flow with a fully catalytic wall, 
so that surface equilibrium exists by definition, yields similar results. 
Our approximate analysis of stagnation heating relies again on Eq. (6.51), 
which we restate here:

what Eq. (6.50) would imply. For a calorically perfect gas, where Eq. (6.84)
applies, no distinction between temperature and enthalpy need be made. In a
chemically reacting gas, dissociation and ionization will alter the balance
between effective heat capacity and temperature and thus significantly affect the
flowfield. However, the net effect on the boundary-layer flowfield total enthalpy
difference (H,.— H,,) and hence the wall heat flux may be small.

The implication is that the neglect of real gas effects, although horrifying to a
physical gas dynamicist, may be fairly reasonable for our purposes. This is
especially true when chemical equilibrium exists in the boundary-layer flowfield,
an approximation that is reasonable in the stagnation region. Also, the
assumption of a non-equilibrium boundary-layer flow with a fully catalytic wall,
so that surface equilibrium exists by definition, yields similar results.

Our approximate analysis of stagnation heating relies again on Eq. (6.51),
which we restate here:

gw = (Nut /Pr)(/L)Hoe( — Hw/ Hoe) (6.85)

Previously we rearranged this equation to employ the Stanton number instead

the skin friction coefficient. This was done because skin friction data are more 
easily obtained and generalized, if only empirically, than are heat transfer data

layer flow in the stagnation region shown in Fig. 6.12 is sufficiently well 
understood that a more direct approach is possible.

relatively well understood, a consequence resulting in part from their somewhat 
limited flexibility in mission design. The subject of ballistic and semiballistic

Many lifting-body designs have been flown subsonically, in crucial demon-

date is Mach 1.86, and the highest altitude 27.5 km, both by the HL-10 at 
NASA's Dryden Flight Research center4' in February 1970. Numerous high-

(a) For lunar return missions, Apollo performed a mild version of the skip 
entry. A most important factor in this type of entry is ensuring that, 
upon completion of the skip, spacecraft velocity is low enough, and at 
a low enough angle, to prevent returning the vehicle to a long, high 
orbit prior to the second entry. Choose a reasonable velocity 
constraint, and find the entry angle constraint that results. 
(b) It is equally important not to dig too deeply into the atmosphere on the 
first pass, as unacceptable g loads will result. Assuming maximum 
loads at the pull-up point of the skip entry (not exactly true, but close), 
find the flight-path angle constraint that guarantees an acceptable g 
load. 
6.3 The shuttle orbiter performs a reentry in which the angle of attack, and 
consequently the LID, can vary considerably depending on the particular 
entry requirements for a given mission. However, let us assume that a 
basic entry profile can be approximated by the use of an average or typical 
value of LID of 1.05, which corresponds to a! = 40". This turns out to be 
reasonable for flight, above Mach 12, which comprises most of the entry 
flight regime (AIAA JSR, Jan.-Feb. 1983). Let us define comple-

Attitude Determination and Control

7.1. Introduction

In this chapter we discuss what is often considered to be the most complex and
least intuitive of the space vehicle design disciplines, that of attitude
determination and control. The authors agree with this assessment, but would
add that the more complex aspects of the subject are of primarily theoretical
interest, having limited connection with practical spacecraft design and
performance analysis. Exceptions exist, of course, and will be discussed here
because of their instructional value. However, we believe that the most
significant features of attitude determination and control system (ADCS) design
can be understood in terms of rigid body rotational mechanics modified by the
effects of flexibility and internal energy dissipation. At this level, the subject is
quite accessible at the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate level.

Even so, we recognize that the required mathematical sophistication will be
considered excessive by many readers. Attitude dynamics analysis is necessarily

complex due to three factors. Attitude information is inherently vectorial,
" requiring three coordinates for its complete specification. Attitude analysis deals
inherently with rotating, hence noninertial, frames. Finally, rotations are
inherently order dependent in their description; the mathematics that describes
them therefore lacks the multiplicative commutativity found in basic algebra.

In the following discussion, we attempt to alleviate this by appealing to the
many analogies between rotational and translational dynamics and, as always, by
stressing applications rather than derivations of ‘results. Those requiring more
detail are urged to consult one of the many excellent references in the field.

Attitude determination and control is typically a major vehicle subsystem,
with requirements that quite often drive the overall spacecraft design.

7.2.1 Definjtion of Attitude 
Spacecraft attitude refers to the angular orientation of a defined body-fixed 
coordinate frame with respect to a separately defined external frame. The 
spacecraft body frame may be arbitrarily chosen; however, some ways of 
defining it offer more utility than others, as we will see. The external frame may 1 
be one of the "inertial" systems discussed in Chapter 4 (GCI or HCI), or it may be 
a non-inertial system such as the local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) frame, , 
which is used to define the flight path angle (Fig. 4.9). i ! 
Astute readers will note that we have mentioned only the angular orientation 
between a spacecraft and an external frame, whereas in general some 
translational offset will also exist between the two. This is illustrated in 
Fig. 7.1, and leads to the question of the influence of parallax in performing 
spacecraft attitude measurements with respect to the "fixed" stars, which serve as 
the basis for inertial frames. ! 
The concept of parallax is shown in Fig. 7.2. As seen, measurements of angles 
with respect to a given star will differ for frames whose origins are located apart. 
However, in almost all cases of practical interest parallax effects are insignificant

7.2.1 Definition of Attitude

Spacecraft attitude refers to the angular orientation of a defined body-fixed
coordinate frame with respect to a separately defined external frame. The
spacecraft body frame may be arbitrarily chosen; however, some ways of
defining it offer more utility than others, as we will see. The external frame may
be one of the “inertial” systems discussed in Chapter 4 (GCI or HCI), or it may be
a non-inertial system such as the local vertical, local horizontal (LVLH) frame,
which is used to define the flight path angle (Fig. 4.9).

Astute readers will note that we have mentioned only the angular orientation
between a spacecraft and an external frame, whereas in general some
translational offset will also exist between the two. This is illustrated in
Fig. 7.1, and leads to the question of the influence of parallax in performing
spacecraft attitude measurements with respect to the “fixed” stars, which serve as
the basis for inertial frames.

The concept of parallax is shown in Fig. 7.2. As seen, measurements of angles
with respect to a given star will differ for frames whose origins are located apart.
However, in almost all cases of practical interest parallax effects are insignificant

for spacecraft. The nearest star system, a-Centauri, is approximately 4.3 
lightyears (LY) from Earth. Using the Earth's orbital diameter as a baseline, 
and making measurements six months apart, an object will show a parallax of 
1 arcsecond at a distance of 3.26 LY, a quantity defmed for obvious reasons as a 
parsec. Thus, even a-Centauri has a parallax of only about 0.75 arcsecond; all 
other stars have less. For most practical purposes, then, the location of a 
spacecraft will not influence measurements made to determine its attitude. 
As always, exceptions exist. The European Space Agency's Hipparcos 
spacecraft was placed in orbit in 1989 for the purpose of making astrometric 
measurements of the parallax of some 120,000 relatively nearby stars, down to 
about loth magnitude, so that their distances could be more accurately 
determined. Angular measurement errors of order 0.002 arcsecond (about 
10 mad) were sought. (The Hubble Space Telescope is also designed to make 
such measurements, though not to this level of precision.) Obviously, the "error" 
due to stellar parallax is precisely the measurement sought by these missions. 
As another example, HST is required to track and observe moving objects 
within the solar system to within 0.01 arcsec. At this level, parallax errors 
induced by HST movement across its Earth-orbital baseline diameter of 
13,500 km are significant. Mars, for example, periodically approaches to within 
approximately 75 million km of Earth. During a half-orbit of HST it would then 
appear to shift its position by about 180 arcseconds rad, or roughly 36 arcseconds, 
against the background of fixed guide stars. The tracking accuracy requirement

HST pointing algorithm. 
Attitude determination refers to the process (to which we have already I 
alluded) of measuring spacecraft orientation. Attitude control implies a process, 
usually occurring more or less continuously, of returning the spacecraft to a 
desired orientation, given that the measurement reveals a discrepancy. In 
practice, errors of both measurement and actuation will always exist, and so both I 
these processes take place within some tolerance. 
Errors will result from inexact execution of reorientation maneuvers that are 
themselves based on inexact measurements, and will in addition arise from 
disturbances both internally and externally generated. The spacecraft is not 
i capable of responding instantly to these disturbances; some time is always 
consumed in the process of measuring an error and computing and applying a 
correction. This leads to a typical pointing history such as shown in Fig. 7.3. 
Close examination of this figure reveals several features of interest. 
The low-frequency, cyclic departure from and restoration to an average value I 
is the result of the error detection and correction process implemented by the 
ADCS. It is roughly periodic, an artifact of the finite interval required to sense an 
error and implement a correction. This fundamental period, T, implies a limit to 
the frequency response of the spacecraft, called the bandwidth or passband, of 
I about 117 Hz. A disturbance (such as an internal vibration or external impulsive 
torque), which has a frequency content higher than this, is simply not sensed by ,

usually occurring more or less continuously, of returning the spacecraft to a

Close examination of this figure reveals several features of interest.

The low-frequency, cyclic departure from and restoration to an average value
is the result of the error detection and correction process implemented by the
ADCS. It is roughly periodic, an artifact of the finite interval required to sense an
error and implement a correction. This fundamental period, 7, implies a limit to
the frequency response of the spacecraft, called the bandwidth or passband, of
about 1/7 Hz. A disturbance (such as an internal vibration or external impulsive
torque), which has a frequency content higher than this, is simply not sensed by
the spacecraft ADCS. Only the longer-term integrated effect, if such exists, is
correctable.

This inability to sense and respond to high-frequency disturbances produces
the jitter on the signal shown in Fig. 7.3. Jitter then refers to the high-frequency
(meaning above the spacecraft passband) discrepancy between the actual and

desired attitude. Attitude error, as we will use it henceforth, implies the low-

I AlTlTUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL 329 + We will return shortly to the discussion of attitude jitter. For the moment, note 
that a long-term integration (several T periods) of the data in Fig. 7.3 would 
clearly yield an average value 8, displaced from the desired value Od. This bias in 
the attitude could be due to sensor or actuator misalignment, to the effects of 
certain types of disturbances, or to more subtle properties of the control 
algorithm. Note further that Od is not always (and maybe not even very often) a 
constant. If not, we are said to have a tracking problem, as opposed to the much 
simpler constant-angle pointing problem. Tracking at higher rates or nonconstant 
rates generally yields poorer average performances than does pointing or low- 
rate tracking, or requires more complex engineering to achieve comparable 
performance. 
7.2.2 Attitude Jjtter 
Spacecraft attitude jitter is almost universally discussed in statistical terms, a 
view consistent with the fact that the jitter is, by definition, not subject to ADCS 
influence, and is therefore LLrandom" in that sense. Continuing in this vein, we 
note that by subtracting the average value 8, from the data, we produce by 
definition a zero-mean history such as shown in Fig. 7.4. The smooth central 
curve results from filtering the data to remove the jitter, ie., the components 
above the spacecraft passband. This curve is what we have earlier denoted the 
attitude error. 
If we subtract the smooth central curve as well, we retain only the jitter, as 
shown in Fig. 7.5. This jitter can have sources both deterministic and random. An 
example of the former could be the vibration of an attitude sensor due to an 
internal source at a structural frequency above the control system passband. 
Random jitter may be due to many causes, including electronic and mechanical 
noise in the sensors and actuators. Our use of the term "noise" in this sense 
somewhat begs the question; perception of noise often depends on who is using 
the data. The spacecraft structural engineer will regard only the electronic effects 
as noise; the structural vibrations are, if included in the data, "signal" to him. The

, We will return shortly to the discussion of attitude jitter. For the moment, note
that a long-term integration (several 7 periods) of the data in Fig. 7.3 would
clearly yield an average value 6, displaced from the desired value 6,. This bias in
the attitude could be due to sensor or actuator misalignment, to the effects of
certain types of disturbances, or to more subtle properties of the control
algorithm. Note further that 6, is not always (and maybe not even very often) a
constant. If not, we are said to have a tracking problem, as opposed to the much
simpler constant-angle pointing problem. Tracking at higher rates or nonconstant
rates generally yields poorer average performances than does pointing or low-
rate tracking, or requires more complex engineering to achieve comparable
performance.

7.2.2 Attitude Jitter

Spacecraft attitude jitter is almost universally discussed in statistical terms, a
view consistent with the fact that the jitter is, by definition, not subject to ADCS
influence, and is therefore “random” in that sense. Continuing in this vein, we
note that by subtracting the average value 6, from the data, we produce by
definition a zero-mean history such as shown in Fig. 7.4. The smooth central
curve results from filtering the data to remove the jitter, Le., the components
above the spacecraft passband. This curve is what we have earlier denoted the
attitude error.

If we subtract the smooth central curve as well, we retain only the jitter, as
shown in Fig. 7.5. This jitter can have sources both deterministic and random. An
example of the former could be the vibration of an attitude sensor due to an
internal source at a structural frequency above the control system passband.
Random jitter may be due to many causes, including electronic and mechanical
noise in the sensors and actuators. Our use of the term “noise” in this sense
somewhat begs the question; perception of noise often depends on who is using
the data. The spacecraft structural engineer will regard only the electronic effects
as noise; the structural vibrations are, if included in the data, “signal” to him. The

value in isolating the electronic disturbances. To the ADCS engineer, it is all

removing or coping with it. 
Because of the crucial importance to ADCS design of controlling attitude 
jitter, some discussion of the approach to its modeling is in order here. Readers 
conversant with the terminology of probability and statistics will have no 
difficulty with the subsequent discussion; others may wish to review the slightly 
broader discussion in Appendix A, or one of the many available references in the 
field. 
Because of the way we have constructed Fig. 7.5, the time history of the 
attitude jitter has a mean value of zero, as noted earlier. Further, it is usually 
profitable in ADCS analysis to assume that the jitter is random, and that at any 
instant in time its amplitude has a Gaussian or normal probability distribution. In 
the language of probability theory, then, we view the jitter as a zero-mean 
Gaussian random process. A Gaussian distribution is fully characterized by only 
two parameters, its mean (zero in this example) and its variance, always denoted 
2 as o . 
The seemingly restrictive (but enormously convenient) assumption of 
Gaussian process statistics is usually quite well satisfied in practice. This results 
from application of the central limit theorem of  statistic^,^ which loosely states 
that the sum of many independent zero-mean probability distributions converges 
in the limit to a Gaussian distribution. In practice (and this is a forever surprising 
result) "many" may be as few as four or five, and rarely more than 10, unless we

are at the extremes of the normal curve shown in Fig 7.6. Because we usually 
have very many independent noise sources in a system, in most cases we can rely 
quite comfortably on the assumption of zero-mean Gaussian noise. 
If the jitter amplitude data are squared, we obtain the instantaneous power in 
the signal, usually called the noise power, N(t). If the amplitude data are Gaussian 
distributed, N(t) is Gaussian as -well, though now with mean No > 0. If N(t) is 
averaged over time and found to yield the same process statistics (mean and 
variance only, for a Gaussian) at any epoch, the noise process is said to be 
stationary. Note carefully that a stationary process does not necessarily produce 
the same values of noise power, N(t), at two different times, tl and t2. Rather, 
stationarity implies that N(tl) and N(t2) are sample values drawn from an 
underlying distribution having the same process statistics (No and 2 for a 
Gaussian) at any time. 
Each jitter time history can be viewed as being only one example of an 
ensemble of possible sequences. If an average across the ensemble of sequences 
would yield the same constant process statistics as the average over a given time 
sequence, the process is further said to be ergodic; the time average and the 
ensemble average are the same. If a process is ergodic, it is of course stationary,

are at the extremes of the normal curve shown in Fig 7.6. Because we usually
have very many independent noise sources in a system, in most cases we can rely
quite comfortably on the assumption of zero-mean Gaussian noise.

If the jitter amplitude data are squared, we obtain the instantaneous power in
the signal, usually called the noise power, N(t). If the amplitude data are Gaussian
distributed, M(t) is Gaussian as ‘well, though now with mean Np > 0. If N(1) is
averaged over time and found to yield the same process statistics (mean and
variance only, for a Gaussian) at any epoch, the noise process is said to be
stationary. Note carefully that a stationary process does not necessarily produce
the same values of noise power, N(2), at two different times, t; and f2. Rather,
stationarity implies that N(t,) and N(f2) are sample values drawn from an
underlying distribution having the same process statistics (V, and o” for a
Gaussian) at any time.

Each jitter time history can be viewed as being only one example of an
ensemble of possible sequences. If an average across the ensemble of sequences
would yield the same constant process statistics as the average over a given time
sequence, the process is further said to be ergodic; the time average and the
ensemble average are the same. If a process is ergodic, it is of course stationary,

but not conversely. In nearly all practical applications, ergodicity is assumed, 
even though such an assumption can be difficult to verify. 
If the power spectral density (see Chapter 12) of the jitter is constant across all I 
frequencies, the noise is said to be white, while if not constant, it is of course 
colored. These terms derive from the fact that the noise power, if constant at all 
frequencies (colors), is white by analogy to white light in optics. White noise 
cannot truly exist, as it possesses infinite total signal power; however, in usual I 
applications the assumption of white Gaussian noise (WGN) is nearly universal. 
It is also reasonable, in that the system passband is often quite narrow with 
respect to the variations in the noise spectrum. Thus, in any such narrow segment, 
the noise power may indeed be approximately constant. Moreover, even highly , 
colored noise can often be represented by the process of filtering an initially white 
noise input. Thus, the assumption of WGN processes is often both realistic and 
analytically convenient. 
Under the zero-mean WGN jitter model, we note that the maximum amplitude 
excursion seen in Fig. 7.5 can be loosely said to fall at about the 3u point. 
(Strictly, 99.73% of the data from a Gaussian distribution fall within + 3u of the 
mean.) This defines the corresponding 2u and 1 a levels, at approximately 95.4% 
and 68.3%, respectively. Attitude jitter specifications are most commonly quoted 
in terms of either lo or 3o performance levels. To discuss the average value 
requires more care; as mentioned repeatedly, the average jitter amplitude is zero. 
This is not a useful concept in characterizing the system performance. However, 
if we square the data, average over time interval T, and then square-root the result 
(the so-called root-mean-square, or rms, operation), we obtain a useful average 
system jitter. In essence, we can more usefully describe the jitter in terms of its 
power rather than its amplitude. For Gaussian processes, the rms and lalevels are 
synonymous. This leads to the common (if not strictly accurate) tendency among 
engineers to consider lo performance to be "average," while 3o behavior 
represents worst case. The reader who has labored through this discussion will 
now appreciate both the utility and limitations of such characterizations. 
Jitter in a spacecraft must be accepted; by its definition, it is the error for which 
we do not compensate. It may, however, be reduced or controlled through proper 
mechanical, configuration, and structural design, as well as through attention to 
use of low-noise subsystems in the vehicle. If this proves insufficient, a more 
sophisticated control system design is required to compensate for disturbances at 
a finer level. In many spacecraft, minimizing attitude jitter becomes a shared, and 
nearly all-consuming, task for the attitude control and structural engineers on the 
project. 
7.2.3 Rotational Kinematics and Celestial Sphere 
Figure 7.7 depicts a celestial sphere centered in the origin of a coordinate

but not conversely. In nearly all practical applications, ergodicity is assumed,
even though such an assumption can be difficult to verify.

If the power spectral density (see Chapter 12) of the jitter is constant across all
frequencies, the noise is said to be white, while if not constant, it is of course
colored. These terms derive from the fact that the noise power, if constant at all
frequencies (colors), is white by analogy to white light in optics. White noise
cannot truly exist, as it possesses infinite total signal power; however, in usual
applications the assumption of white Gaussian noise (WGN) is nearly universal.
It is also reasonable, in that the system passband is often quite narrow with
respect to the variations in the noise spectrum. Thus, in any such narrow segment,
the noise power may indeed be approximately constant. Moreover, even highly
colored noise can often be represented by the process of filtering an initially white
noise input. Thus, the assumption of WGN processes is often both realistic and
analytically convenient.

Under the zero-mean WGN jitter model, we note that the maximum amplitude
excursion seen in Fig. 7.5 can be loosely said to fall at about the 3o point.
(Strictly, 99.73% of the data from a Gaussian distribution fall within + 30 of the
mean.) This defines the corresponding 20 and 1a levels, at approximately 95.4%
and 68.3%, respectively. Attitude jitter specifications are most commonly quoted
in terms of either 1a or 30 performance levels. To discuss the average value
requires more care; aS mentioned repeatedly, the average jitter amplitude is zero.
This is not a useful concept in characterizing the system performance. However,
if we square the data, average over time interval 7, and then square-root the result
(the so-called root-mean-square, or rms, operation), we obtain a useful average
system jitter. In essence, we can more usefully describe the jitter in terms of its
power rather than its amplitude. For Gaussian processes, the rms and Ia levels are
synonymous. This leads to the common (if not strictly accurate) tendency among
engineers to consider lo performance to be “average,” while 30 behavior
represents worst case. The reader who has labored through this discussion will
now appreciate both the utility and limitations of such characterizations.

Jitter in a spacecraft must be accepted; by its definition, it is the error for which
we do not compensate. It may, however, be reduced or controlled through proper
mechanical, configuration, and structural design, as well as through attention to
use of low-noise subsystems in the vehicle. If this proves insufficient, a more
sophisticated control system design is required to compensate for disturbances at
a finer level. In many spacecraft, minimizing attitude jitter becomes a shared, and
nearly all-consuming, task for the attitude control and structural engineers on the

The fundamental quantities of interest in Newtonian translational dynamics 
are mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. Conservation laws for these quantities

origin of the rotating frame lies at the body center of mass (%zipi = O), and 2) the 
position vectors pi are fixed in the body frame (i.e., we have a rigid body, with 
dpldt = 0), we obtain 
The first term on the right is the angular momentum of the rigid body due to its

momentum due to its rotational velocity about its own center of mass. If we 
consider the body to be an orbiting spacecraft, the first term is the orbital angular 
momentum introduced in Chapter 4, while the second is the angular momentum 
in the local center-of-mass frame, which is of interest for attitude dynamics 
analysis. 
Equation (7.12) gives the important result that, for a rigid body, it is possible to 
choose a coordinate frame that decouples the spin angular momentum from the 
orbital angular momentum. Clearly, this is not always possible, and so-called 
spin-orbit coupling can at times be an important consideration in attitude control.

The fundamental quantities of interest in Newtonian translational dynamics
are mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. Conservation laws for these quantities
provide the basis for the description of dynamical systems in classical physics. In
rotational dynamics, the analogous quantities are the moment of inertia, angular

The angular momentum of a mass is the moment of its linear momentum about

H= ry X MV; (7.10)

and for a collection of point masses, the total angular momentum is

If we apply Eqs. (7.7) and (7.8) with V = dR/dt, and if we assume that 1) the
origin of the rotating frame lies at the body center of mass ({m,p; = 0), and 2) the
position vectors p; are fixed in the body frame (i.e., we have a rigid body, with
dp/dt = 0), we obtain

H, = (2m)R x V + Xmip; x ei = Hy,» + A, (7.12)

The first term on the right is the angular momentum of the rigid body due to its
translational velocity V in the inertial frame. The second term is the body angular
momentum due to its rotational velocity about its own center of mass. If we
consider the body to be an orbiting spacecraft, the first term is the orbital angular
momentum introduced in Chapter 4, while the second is the angular momentum
in the local center-of-mass frame, which is of interest for attitude dynamics
analysis.

choose a coordinate frame that decouples the spin angular momentum from the

Because I is a real, symmetric matrix, it is always possible to find a coordinate 
system in which the inertia products are zero, i.e., the matrix is diagonal.5 The 
elements of the inertia matrix may then be abbreviated 11, I*, and 13, and are 
referred to as the principal moments of inertia, while the corresponding 
coordinates are called principal axes. These are the "natural" coordinate axes for 
the body, in that a symmetry axis in the body, if it exists, will be one of the 
principal axes. 
Because of the generality of this result, it is customary to assume the use of a 
principal axis set in most attitude analysis. Unless otherwise stated, we Bsume 
such in this text. This convenient analytical assumption is usually violated in the 
real world. Spacecraft designers will normally select a principal axis coordinate 
frame for attitude reference purposes. However, minor asymmetries and 
misalignments can be expected to develop during vehicle integration, leading to 
differences between the intended and actual principal axes. When this occurs, 
attitude error measurements and control corrections intended about one axis will 
couple into others. Such coupling is seen by the attitude control system as an 
unwanted disturbance to be removed; therefore, there will normally be interface

The solution for (he angular velocity components is 
where the natural frequency wn is defined by 
The conceptual picture represented by this solution is that of a body with an 
essentially symmetrical mass distribution spinning rapidly about the axis of 
symmetry, which we have defined to be the z axis. This rapid rotation is at 
essentially constant speed o, = 42. However, a smaller x-y plane component of 
angular velocity, time varying in its orientation, also exists. This component 
rotates periodically around the body z axis at a natural or "nutation" frequency on 
determined by the body's inertia ratios. This results in a circular motion of the 
body z axis around the angular momentum vector H at the nutation frequency. 
(Recall H is fixed in inertial space because no torques are present.) The motion 
can have one of two general patterns, depending on the ratio of I, to I, or I,. 
Figure 7.1 1 shows the two cases. The angle v between the body z axis and the 
inertially fixed H vector is called the nutation angle. 
The space cone in Fig. 7.1 1 refers to the fact that H is fixed in inertial space. 
Conversely, Eqs. (7.27) are expressed in body coordinates, and so the body cone 
is defined relative to the body principal axis frame. The space cone may lie inside 
or outside the body cone, depending on whether the spinning body is "pencil 
shaped" (I, < I, r I,,) or "saucer shaped" (I, > I, r I,). 
The preceding discussion can be generalized'.5 to include the case where 
I, # I,,. We then have the possibility that the spin axis inertia I, is intermediate 
between I, and I,.. In such a case, Eqs. (7.27) and (7.30) show that 4 C 0; i.e., the

where the natural frequency w, is defined by
w? == K,K,0? (7.30)

The conceptual picture represented by this solution is that of a body with an
essentially symmetrical mass distribution spinning rapidly about the axis of
symmetry, which we have defined to be the z axis. This rapid rotation is at
essentially constant speed w, = 1. However, a smaller x~y plane component of
angular velocity, time varying in its orientation, also exists. This component
rotates periodically around the body z axis at a natural or “nutation” frequency w,,
determined by the body’s inertia ratios. This results in a circular motion of the
body z axis around the angular momentum vector H at the nutation frequency.
(Recall H is fixed in inertial space because no torques are present.) The motion
can have one of two general patterns, depending on the ratio of J, to I, or Jy.
Figure 7.11 shows the two cases. The angle v between the body z axis and the
inertially fixed H vector is called the nutation angle.

The space cone in Fig. 7.11 refers to the fact that H is fixed in inertial space.
Conversely, Eqs. (7.27) are expressed in body coordinates, and so the body cone
is defined relative to the body principal axis frame. The space cone may lie inside
or outside the body cone, depending on whether the spinning body is ‘“‘pencil
shaped” (I, < J, = J,) or “saucer shaped” (I, > I, = 1).

The preceding discussion can be generalized to include the case where
I, # I,. We then have the possibility that the spin axis inertia /, is intermediate
between /, and /,. In such a case, Egs. (7.27) and (7.30) show that «? < 0; i.e., the

nutation frequency is imaginary. The previous sinusoidal solution for ox and y 
becomes an exponential solution, expressible if desired in teims of hyperbolic 
functions. Thus, the body cannot have a fixed nutation angle when spinning 
primarily about an axis of intermediate inertia moment. Elementary stability 
analysis shows that if a rigid body is initially spinning perfectly about such an 
axis, any perturbing torque will result in the growth of the nutation angle until the 
body is spinning about either the maximum or minimum inertia axis, depending 
on initial conditions. We thus have the important result that a rigid body can 
rotate about its extreme inertia axes, but not the intermediate axis. 
This important conclusion is further modified if flexibility is considered. If the 
body is not rigid, energy dissipation must occur as it flexes. Because total system 
energy must be conserved, this energy, dissipated as heat, must be derived from 
the rotational kinetic energy, Eq. (7.21). Thus, a flexible spinning body causes 
Em, to decrease. At the same time, however, the angular momentum for the 
torque-free system must be constant. Ignoring for the moment the vector nature 
of these quantities, we have then the constraints 
hence 
Clearly, if energy is to be dissipated (and the second law of thermodynamics 
guarantees that it will), the moment of inertia must increase. If the body is not to 
be permanently deformed, the spin axis must shift (in body coordinates, of 
course; the spin axis is fixed in space by the requirement that H be constant) to the 
maximum-inertia axis. To visualize this, we imagine an energy-dissipating body 
with its angular momentum vector initially aligned with the minimum-inertia - 
axis. As energy is lost, the nutation angle grows to satisfy Eq. (7.33). Eventually, 
the nutation has grown to 90°, the maximum possible. The body will be spinning 
at a slower rate about the maximum-inertia principal his. This is colloquially 
referred to as aflar spin, a name instantly evocative of the condition. 
Thus, in the absence of external torques a real body can spin stably only about 
the axis of maximum moment of inertia. This so-called major axis rule was 
discovered, empirically and embarrassingly, following the launch of Explorer 1 
as the first U.S. satellite on 1 February 1958. The cylindrically shaped satellite 
was initially spin stabilized about its long axis, and had four flexible wire 
antennas for communication with ground tracking stations. Within hours, the 
energy dissipation inherent in the antennas had caused the satellite to decay into a 
flat spin, a condition revealed by its effect on the air-to-ground communications 
link. This initially puzzling behavior was quickly explained by Ron Bracewell 
and Owen Garriott, then of Stanford University (Garriott later became a Skylab 
and shuttle a~tronaut).~

nutation frequency is imaginary. The previous sinusoidal solution for w, and w,
becomes an exponential solution, expressible if desired in terms of hyperbolic
functions. Thus, the body cannot have a fixed nutation angle when spinning
primarily about an axis of intermediate inertia moment. Elementary stability
analysis shows that if a rigid body is initially spinning perfectly about such an
axis, any perturbing torque will result in the growth of the nutation angle until the
body is spinning about either the maximum or minimum inertia axis, depending
on initial conditions. We thus have the important result that a rigid body can
rotate about its extreme inertia axes, but not the intermediate axis.

This important conclusion is further modified if flexibility is considered. If the
body is not rigid, energy dissipation must occur as it flexes. Because total system
energy must be conserved, this energy, dissipated as heat, must be derived from
the rotational kinetic energy, Eq. (7.21). Thus, a flexible spinning body causes
Eror to decrease. At the same time, however, the angular momentum for the
torque-free system must be constant. Ignoring for the moment the vector nature
of these quantities, we have then the constraints

Exo = Ho? (7.31)
H=Ilw (7.32)
hence
H2
Exo = > (7.33)

Clearly; if energy is to be dissipated (and the second law of thermodynamics
guarantees that it will), the moment of inertia must increase. If the body is not to
be permanently deformed, the spin axis must shift (in body coordinates, of
course; the spin axis is fixed in space by the requirement that H be constant) to the
maximum-inertia axis. To visualize this, we imagine an energy-dissipating body
with its angular momentum vector initially aligned with the minimum-inertia
axis. As energy is lost, the nutation angle grows to satisfy Eq. (7.33). Eventually,
the nutation has grown to 90°, the maximum possible. The body will be spinning
at a slower rate about the maximum-inertia principal axis. This is colloquially
referred to as a flat spin, a name instantly evocative of the condition.

Thus, in the absence of external torques a real body can spin stably only about

and relative magnitude is an essential part of the ADCS designer's task. 
7.5.1 Aerodynamic Torque 
The role of the upper atmosphere in producing satellite drag was discussed in 
Chapter 4 in connection with orbit decay. The same drag force will, in general, 
produce a disturbance torque on the spacecraft due to any offset that exists 
between the aerodynamic center of pressure and the center of mass. Assuming rcp 
to be the center-of-pressure (CP) vector in body coordinates, the aerodynamic 
torque is

where, as in Chapter 4, the aerodynamic force vector is 
and 
p = atmosphere density 
V = spacecraft velocity 
S = spacecraft projected area I V 
CD = drag coefficient, usually between 1 and 2 for free-molecular flow. 
It is important to note that r, varies with spacecraft attitude and, normally, 
with the operational state of the spacecraft (solar panel position, fuel on board, 
etc.). As we discussed in Chapter 4, major uncertainties exist with respect to the 
evaluation of Eq. (7.35). Drag coefficient uncertainties can easily be of order 
50%, while upper atmosphere density variations approaching an order of 
magnitude relative to the standard model are not uncommon. Thus, if aero- 
dynamic torques are large enough to be a design factor for the attitude control 
system, they need to be treated with appropriate conservatism. 
As an example, let us consider a satellite with a frontal area S = 5 m2 and a 
drag coefficient CD = 2 orbiting at 400 km, with standard model atmospheric 
density p = 4 x 10-l2 kg/m3. Assuming circular velocity at this altitude, the 
magnitude of the disturbance torque is T/rcp = 1.2 x N. This seems small, 
and is, but to put it in perspective, let us assume it to be the only torque acting on 
the spacecraft, through a moment arm of r,, = 1 cm, and that the spacecraft 
moment of inertia about the torque axis is I = 1000 kg. m2. Equations (7.23)

Chapter 4 in connection with orbit decay. The same drag force will, in general,
produce a disturbance torque on the spacecraft due to any offset that exists
between the aerodynamic center of pressure and the center of mass. Assuming Pcp

Cp = drag coefficient, usually between 1 and 2 for free-molecular flow.

It is important to note that r,, varies with spacecraft attitude and, normally,
with the operational state of the spacecraft (solar panel position, fuel on board,
etc.). As we discussed in Chapter 4, major uncertainties exist with respect to the
evaluation of Eq. (7.35). Drag coefficient uncertainties can easily be of order
50%, while upper atmosphere density variations approaching an order of
magnitude relative to the standard model are not uncommon. Thus, if aero-
dynamic torques are large enough to be a design factor for the attitude control
system, they need to be treated with appropriate conservatism.

As an example, let us consider a satellite with a frontal area S = 5 m* and a
drag coefficient Cp = 2 orbiting at 400 km, with standard model atmospheric
density p= 4 x 10° kg/m*. Assuming circular velocity at this altitude, the
magnitude of the disturbance torque is T/r,) = 1.2 x 107° N. This seems small,
and is, but to put it in perspective, let us assume it to be the only torque acting on
the spacecraft, through a moment arm of 7.) = 1 cm, and that the spacecraft

However, left uncorrected, the spacecraft will drift about 0.012 rad, or 0.7 deg,

Even worse, the error growth is quadratic, so this aerodynamic torque applied 
over 10,000 s, about 3 h or 2 orbits, would produce a 1 rad pointing error! This is 
unacceptable in almost any conceivable application. Thus, even small 
I. disturbance torques will be problematic if corrections are not applied. 
7.5.2 Gravity- Gradient Torque 
Planetary gravitational fields decrease with distance r from the center of the 
planet according to the Newtonian I /r law, provided higher order harmonics as 
discussed in Chapter 4'are neglected. Thus, an object in orbit will experience a 
stronger attraction on its "lower" side than its "upper" side. This differential 
attraction, if applied to a body having unequal principal moments of inertia, 
results in a torque tending to rotate the object to align its "long axis" (minimum 
inertia axis) with the local vertical. Perturbations from this equilibrium produce a 
restoring torque toward the stable vertical position, causing a periodic oscillatory 
or "librational" motion. Energy dissipation in the spacecraft will ultimately damp 
this motion.

However, left uncorrected, the spacecraft will drift about 0.012 rad, or 0.7 deg,
after 1000 s. This is in most cases a large error for an attitude control system.

7.5.2 Gravity-Gradient Torque

Planetary gravitational fields decrease with distance r from the center of the
planet according to the Newtonian 1 / r” law, provided higher order harmonics as
discussed in Chapter 4 are neglected. Thus, an object in orbit will experience a
stronger attraction on its “lower” side than its “upper” side. This differential
attraction, if applied to a body having unequal principal moments of inertia,
results in a torque tending to rotate the object to align its “long axis” (minimum
inertia axis) with the local vertical. Perturbations from this equilibrium produce a
restoring torque toward the stable vertical position, causing a periodic oscillatory
or “librational” motion. Energy dissipation in the spacecraft will ultimately damp
this motion.

i = (-sin 8, sin 4, 1 - sin2 8 - sin2 41T S (-0, 4, 1lT (7.41) 
with the approximation holding for small angular displacements. Then the 
gravity gradient torque vector may be expressed in the body frame as 
T = 3n2[(l, - I,)+, (I, - 1,)8, OIT (7.42) 
It is seen that the spacecraft yaw angle $ does not influence the gavity- 
gradient torque; this is intuitively reasonable, because yaw represents rotation 
around the local vertical. We also note from Eq. (7.42) that the gravity-gradient 
Muence is proportional to 1 /r 3. The torque magnitude clearly depends upon the 
difference between principal moments; thus, spacecraft that are long and thin are 
more affected than those that are short and fat. 
To get an idea of a typical gravity-gradient torque magnitude, consider a 
low-orbiting spacecraft with n S 0.001 rad/s and an inertia moment difference 
in the relevant axis of 1000 kg . m2. Then T = 5 x N - m/deg. 
7.5.3 Solar Radliatlon Pressure Torque 
Solar radiation pressure and its effect upon spacecraft orbital dynamics was 
discussed-in Chapter 4. As with aerodynamic drag, solar radiation pressure can 
produce disturbance torques as well as forces, which may require compensation 
from the attitude control system (ACS). The solar radiation pressure torque is, in

It is seen that the spacecraft yaw angle w does not influence the gravity-

7.5.3 Solar Radiation Pressure Torque

Solar radiation pressure and its effect upon spacecraft orbital dynamics was
discussed in Chapter 4. As with aerodynamic drag, solar radiation pressure can

Solar radiation torque is independent of spacecraft position or velocity, as long 
as the vehicle is in sunlight, and is always perpendicular to the sun line. It will, in 
many cases, thus have no easily visualized relationship with the previously 
considered aerodynamic and gravity-gradient disturbance torques. For an order 
of magnitude comparison, consider typical values to be Al = 5 m2, K = 0.5, 
r = 0.1 m, and the spacecraft to be in Earth orbit. Then the torque magnitude is 
T = 3.5 x N - m. This would be about two orders of magnitude below the 
representative aerodynamic torque computed earlier for a satellite orbiting at 
400-km altitude. As noted, however, the solar torque is independent of position, 
while the aerodynamic torque is proportional to atmospheric density. Above 
1000-km altitude, solar radiation pressure usually dominates the spacecraft 
disturbance torque environment. 
At geostationary orbit altitude, solar radiation pressure can be the primary 
source of disturbance torque, and designers must take care to balance the 
geometrical configuration to avoid center-of-mass to center-of-pressure offsets. 
The useful lifetime of a geostationary satellite is often controlled by the mass 
budget available for stationkeeping and attitude control fuel. Poor estimates of 
the long-term effect of disturbance torques and forces can and do result in 
premature loss of on-orbit capability. 
Solar radiation pressure can also be important for interplanetary missions. 
While its strength obviously drops off rapidly for outer planet missions, it may in 
the absence of internally generated disturbances be essentially the only torque 
acting upon the vehicle during interplanetary cruise. For missions to Venus and 
Mercury, solar torques will often define the spacecraft disturbance torque limits, 
and can even be used in an active control mode. This was first accomplished on an 
emergency basis following the shutdown of an unstable roll-control loop on the 
Mariner 10 mission to Venus and Mercury. In this case, differential tilt between 
opposing sets of solar panels was used to introduce a deliberate offset between the 
center of mass and center of pressure in such a way as to effect roll control.

Solar radiation torque is independent of spacecraft position or velocity, as long
as the vehicle is in sunlight, and is always perpendicular to the sun line. It will, in
many cases, thus have no easily visualized relationship with the previously
considered aerodynamic and gravity-gradient disturbance torques. For an order
of magnitude comparison, consider typical values to be A, = 5m’, K = 0.5,
r = 0.1 m, and the spacecraft to be in Earth orbit. Then the torque magnitude is

representative aerodynamic torque computed earlier for a satellite orbiting at
400-km altitude. As noted, however, the solar torque is independent of position,
while the aerodynamic torque is proportional to atmospheric density. Above
1000-km altitude, solar radiation pressure usually dominates the spacecraft

exert yet another torque on spacecraft in low orbits about the primary. This is

M is the spacecraft magnetic dipole moment due to current loops and residual 
magnetization in the spacecraft. B is the Earth magnetic field vector expressed in 
spacecrafr coordinates; its magnitude is proportional to l/r3, where r is the 
radius vector to the spacecraft. 
Few aerospace engineers are intimately involved with electromagnetic 
equipment, and so a brief discussion of measurement units for M and B is in 
order. Magnetic moment may be produced physically by passing a current 
through a coil of wire; the larger the coil, the greater the moment produced. Thus, 
in the SI system, M has units of ampere-turn-m2 (~tm~). B is measured in tesla 
(T) in the SI system. With M and B as specified, T of course has units of N . m. 
An older but still popular system of units in electromagnetic theory is the 
centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system. In CGS units, M and B are measured in 
pole-cm and gauss- (G), respectively, with the resultant torque in dyne-cm. 
Conversion factors between the two systems are: 
1 ~tm~ = 1000 pole cm (7.45a) 
Earth's magnetic field at an altitude of 200 km is approximately 0.3 G or 
3 x loF5 T. A typical small spacecraft might possess a residual magnetic 
moment on the order of 0.1 ~tm~. The magnetic torque on such a spacecraft in 
low orbit would then be approximately 3 x loF6 N . m. 
Magnetic torque may well, as in this example, be a disturbance torque. 
However, it is common to reverse the viewpoint and take advantage of the 
planetary magnetic field as a control torque to counter the effects of other 
disturbances. We shall discuss this in more detail in a later section. 
7.5.5 Miscellaneous Disturbance Torques 
In addition to torques introduced by the spacecraft's external environment, a 
variety of other sources of attitude disturbance exist, many of them generated by 
the spacecraft during the course of its operation. 
Effluent venting, whether accidental or deliberate, is a common source of 
spacecraft disturbance torque. When such venting must be allowed, as for 
example with propellant tank pressure relief valves, "T-vents" are typically used 
to minimize the resulting attitude perturbations. Jettisoned parts, such as doors or 
lens covers, will produce a transient reaction torque when released. 
All of the effects we have discussed so far involve an actual momentum 
exchange between the spacecraft and the external environment, resulting from 
the application of an external torque. The momentum change in the spacecraft is

M is the spacecraft magnetic dipole moment due to current loops and residual

spacecraft coordinates; its magnitude is proportional to 1/r3, where r is the
radius vector to the spacecraft. ,

Few aerospace engineers are intimately involved with electromagnetic
equipment, and so a brief discussion of measurement units for M and B is in
order. Magnetic moment may be produced physically by passing a current
through a coil of wire; the larger the coil, the greater the moment produced. Thus,
in the SI system, M has units of ampere-turn-m7 (Atm). B is measured in tesla
(T) in the SI system. With M and B as specified, T of course has units of N - m.

An older but still popular system of units in electromagnetic theory is the
centimeter-gram-second (CGS) system. In CGS units, M and B are measured in
pole-cm and gauss (G), respectively, with the resultant torque in dyne-cm.
Conversion factors between the two systems are:

1 Atm? = 1000 pole cm (7.45a)
1T=10'G (7.45)

Earth’s magnetic field at an altitude of 200 km is approximately 0.3 G or
3x 10°°T. A typical small spacecraft might possess a residual magnetic
moment on the order of 0.1 Atm*. The magnetic torque on such a spacecraft in
low orbit would then be approximately 3 x 107° N- m.

Magnetic torque may well, as in this example, be a disturbance torque.
However, it is common to reverse the viewpoint and take advantage of the
planetary magnetic field as a control torque to counter the effects of other
disturbances. We shall discuss this in more detail in a later section.

ADCS passband limits. When this is so, the ACS can remove only the low- 
frequency components, leaving the remainder to contribute to the overall system

7.6 Passive Attitude Control 
The concept of passive attitude control follows readily from the discussion of 
the preceding sections. Passive stabilization techniques take advantage of basic 
physical principles and naturally occurring forces by designing the spacecraft to 
enhance the effect of one force while reducing others. In effect, we use the 
previously analyzed disturbance torques to control the spacecraft, choosing a 
design to emphasize one and mitigate the others. 
An advantage of passive control is the ability to attain a very long satellite 
lifetime, not limited by onboard consumables or, possibly, even by wear and tear 
on moving parts. Typical disadvantages of passive control are relatively poor 
overall accuracy and somewhat inflexible response to changing conditions. 
Where these limitations are not of concern, passive techniques work very well. 
An excellent example was furnished by the now-obsolete Transit radio 
navigation satellite system,7 for which the main operational requirement was a 
roughly nadir-pointed antenna. These satellites are gravity-gradient stabilized, 
with several having operational lifetimes of over 15 years. 
A spacecraft design intended to provide passive control does not necessarily 
guarantee stability in any useful sense, and indeed we have seen that 
environmental and other effects can induce substantial unwanted attitude motion 
in a passively "stabilized" vehicle. For this reason, most such spacecraft include 
devices designed to augment their natural damping. Such "nutation dampers" can 
take a variety of forms, as we will discuss, and include eddy current dampers,

7.6.1 Spin Stabilization 
A basic passive technique is that of spin stabilization, wherein the intrinsic 
gyroscopic "stiffness" of a 'spinning body is used to maintain its orientation in 
inertial space. If no external disturbance torques are experienced, the angular 
momentum vector remains fixed in space, constant in both direction and 
magnitude. Jf a nutation angle exists, either from initial conditions or as the result 
of a disturbance torque, a properly designed energy damper will quickly (within 
seconds or minutes) remove this angle, so that the spin axis and the angular 
momentum vector are coincident. 
An applied torque will, in general, have components both perpendicular and 
parallel to the momentum vector. The parallel component spins the spacecraft up 
or down, i.e., increases or decreases H. The perpendicular torque component 
causes a displacement of H in the direction of T. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.13, 
where the external force F causing the torque T is perpendicular to the plane

introduce. 
Spin stabilization is useful in a number of special cases where reliability and 
simplicity are more important than operational flexibility. Satellites intended for 
geostationary orbit, for example, are usually spin stabilized for the two required 
transfer orbit burns (see Chapter 4). Some missions utilize spin stabilization as 
the best means of meeting scientific objectives. Notable examples in this regard 
are Pioneers 10 and 11, the first spacecraft to fly by Jupiter and Saturn. The 
primary scientific goal of these spacecraft was the investigation of interplanetary 
electromagnetic fields and particles; this was most easily done from a spinning 
platform. 
Long-term stability of a spinning spacecraft requires, as we have said, a 
favorable inertia ratio. In visual terms, the vehicle must be a "wheel" rather than a 
"pencil." Also, most spin-stabilized satellites will require nutation dampers as 
'mentioned earlier to control the effect of disturbance torques on the spin axis 
motion. Furthermore, if it is desired to be able to alter the inertial orientation of 
the spin axis during the mission, the designer must provide the capability for 
control torques to precess the spin axis. This is commonly done with magnetic 
coils or small thrusters. 
7.6.2 Gravity-Gradient Stabilization 
From our previous discussion, it is clear that a spacecraft in a reasonably low 
orbit will tend to stabilize with its minimum-inertia axis in a vertical orientation. 
This property can obviously be used to advantage by the designer when a nadir or 
zenith orientation is desired for particular instruments. The principal design 
feature of such a satellite again involves the inertia ratio; the vehicle must possess 
an axis such that 1,4 I,, I,. As noted previously, even when the spacecraft is 
designed in this fashion, the control torques are small, and additional damping is 
required to remove pendulum-like oscillations due to disturbances. These 
oscillations, or librations, are typically controlled through the use of magnetic 
hysteresis rods or eddy current dampers. Active "damping" (really active control) 
is also possible and, as might be expected, typically offers better performance. 
The usual way of obtaining the required spacecraft inertia properties (i.e., long 
and thin) is to deploy a motof-driven boom with a relatively heavy (several 
kilograms or more) end mass. The "boom" will often be little more than a reel of 
prestressed metallic tape, similar to the familiar carpenter's measuring tape, 
which when unrolled springs into a more or less cylindrical form. Such an "open 
stem" boom will have substantial (for its mass) lateral stiffness, but little torsional 
rigidity. The possibility of coupling between easily excited, lightly damped 
torsional modes and the librational modes then arises, and often cannot be

352 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Pure gravity-gradient attitude control provides no inherent yaw stability; the 
spacecraft is completely free to rotate about its vertical axis. When this is 
unacceptable, additional measures must be taken. One possibility is to add a 
momentum wheel with its axis perpendicular to the spacecraft vertical axis, as 
shown in Fig. 7.14. A stable condition then occurs with the wheel angular 
momentum aligned along the positive orbit n~rmal.~ Such a configuration has 
been flown on numerous satellites, though not with uniform success. Large 
amplitude librations are sometimes observed, often during particular orbital 
"seasons" (i.e., sun angles). Oscillations of sufficient magnitude to invert the 
spacecraft have occasionally occurred. These have been linked to long-period 
resonances in the spacecraft gravity-gradient boom that are excited by solar 
thermal input under the right  condition^.^ 
Gravity-gradient stabilization is useful when long life on orbit is needed and 
attitude stabilization requirements are relatively broad. Libration amplitudes of 
10-20 deg are not uncommon, although better performance can be obtained with 
careful design. An example is the GEOSAT spacecraft, a U.S. Navy radar 
altimetry satellite launched in 1984. Vertical stabilization to within lo (la) was 
achieved through the use of a very stiff boom having an eddy current damper as 
its tip mass. In general, though, it wili be found that gravity-gradient stabilization

7.6.3 Aerodynamic and Solar Pressure Stabilization 
As with gravity gradient, the existence of aerodynamic and solar radiation 
pressure torques implies the possibility of their use in spacecraft control. This has 
in fact been accomplished, although the flight history is considerably reduced 
compared to the gravity-gradient case. The most prominent example of 
aerodynamic stabilization occurred with MAGSAT, a low-altitude spacecraft 
intended to map the Earth's magnetic field.'' This vehicle used an aerodynamic 
trim boom to assist in orienting the spacecraft. 
The first use of solar radiation pressure to control a spacecraft occurred during 
the Mariner 10 mission, during which a sequence of Mercury and Venus flybys 
were executed. Nearly three months into its cruise phase between Earth and 
Venus, instability in the attitude control loop was encountered during a sequence 
of spacecraft roll and scan platform articulation maneuvers." The resulting 
oscillations depleted 0.6 kg, about 16%, of the spacecraft's nitrogen control gas 
over the course of an hour, prior to shutdown of the roll loop by mission 
controllers. Subsequent analysis showed the problem to be due to an unforeseen 
flexible-body effect, driven by energy input from the scan platform and the roll/ 
yaw thrusters. 
The roll/yaw thrusters were mounted on the tips of the solar panels to take 
advantage of the greater moment of force produced in this configuration. Preflight 
analysis had been done to alleviate concerns over potential excitation of the solar 
panels by the thrusters; the judgment was that only minimal interaction was 
possible due to the substantial difference between the ACS bandwidth and the 
primary solar array structural modes. Under certain flight conditions, however, it 
was found that higher order modes could be excited by the thrusters and that 
energy in these modes could couple into lower frequency modes that would alter 
the spacecraft body attitude. This would, of course, result in further use of the 
thrusters to correct the attitude error, followed by additional disturbances, etc., in 
a classic example of an unfavorable interaction between the structural and 
attitude control system designs. 
In any event, various system-wide corrective measures were taken, and among 
them was a scheme to implement roll control by differentially tilting the 
separately articulated solar panels when necessary to implement a maneuver. The 
scheme worked well, albeit through intensive ground-controller interaction, and 
allowed sufficient fuel to be hoarded to carry the spacecraft through three 
encounters with Mercury.

Refemng to Fig. 7.15 and employing standard notation, we define the 
Laplace-transformed "output," the actual pointing direction, as Y(s) and the 
desired pointing direction or "input" as U(s). The spacecraft or "plant" dynamics 
are represented as polynomial G(s). The input/output relationship is then 
where H(s) is called the system transfer function. The time-domain signal h(t), 
the inverse Laplace transform of H(s), is the impulse response of the system. The 
denominator of the transfer function, 1 + G(s)K(s) as written here, is called the 
characteristic equation. Most performance characteristics of LTI SISO systems 
are determined by the locations of the system poles in the complex s domain (i.e., 
s = a + iw). These poles are the roots of the characteristic equation, leading to 
the use of root locus techniques in the design and analysis of control systems. The 
polynomial degree of the characteristic equation is referred to as the order of the 
system. For example, the damped simple harmonic oscillator used to model many 
basic physical systems, such as a simple pendulum with friction, a mass-spring- 
dashpot arrangement, or a resistive-capacitive-inductive circuit, is the classic 
second-order system. 
7.7.2 Reaction Wheels 
Reaction wheels are a common choice for active spacecraft attitude control, 
particularly with unmanned spacecraft. In this mode of control an electric motor 
attached to the spacecraft spins a small, freely rotating wheel (much like a 
phonograph turntable), the rotational axis of which is aligned with a vehicle 
control axis. The spacecraft must carry one wheel per axis for full attitude 
control. Some redundancy is usually desired, requiring four or more wheels. 
The electric motor drives the wheel in response to a correction command 
computed as part of the spacecraft's feedback control loop. Reaction wheels give 
very fast response relative to other systems. Control system bandwidths can run 
to several tens of hertz. 
Reaction wheels are fairly heavy, cumbersome, expensive, and are potentially 
complex, with moving parts. They are capable of generating internal torques 
only; the wheel aqd spacecraft together produce no net system torque. 
With such a system, the wheel rotates one way and the spacecraft the opposite

application of Euler's momentum equation, the integral of the net torque applied 
over a period of time will produce a particular value of total angular momentum 
stored onboard the spacecraft, resident in the rotating wheel or wheels, depending 
on how many axes are controlled. When it is spinning as fast as it can with the 
given motor drive, the wheel becomes "saturated," and cannot further 
compensate external torques. If further such torques are applied, the spacecraft 
will tumble. In practice it is desirable to avoid operation of a reaction wheel at

the inverse Laplace transform of H(s), is the impulse response of the system. The
denominator of the transfer function, 1 + G(s)K(s) as written here, is called the
characteristic equation. Most performance characteristics of LTI SISO systems
are determined by the locations of the system poles in the complex s domain (i.e.,
s= o + iw). These poles are the roots of the characteristic equation, leading to
the use of root locus techniques in the design and analysis of control systems. The
polynomial degree of the characteristic equation is referred to as the order of the
system. For example, the damped simple harmonic oscillator used to model many
basic physical systems, such as a simple pendulum with friction, a mass-spring-
dashpot arrangement, or a resistive-capacitive-inductive circuit, is the classic
second-order system.

7.7.2 Reaction Wheels

Reaction wheels are a common choice for active spacecraft attitude control,
particularly with unmanned spacecraft. In this mode of control an electric motor
attached to the spacecraft spins a small, freely rotating wheel (much like a
phonograph turntable), the rotational axis of which is aligned with a vehicle
control axis. The spacecraft must carry one wheel per axis for full attitude
control. Some redundancy is usually desired, requiring four or more wheels.
The electric motor drives the wheel in response to a correction command
computed as part of the spacecraft’s feedback control loop. Reaction wheels give
very fast response relative to other systems. Control system bandwidths can run
to several tens of hertz.

Reaction wheels are fairly heavy, cumbersome, expensive, and are potentially
complex, with moving parts. They are capable of generating internal torques
only; the wheel and spacecraft together produce no net system torque.

With such a system, the wheel rotates one way and the spacecraft the opposite
way in response to torques imposed externally on the spacecraft. From
application of Euler’s momentum equation, the integral of the net torque applied
over a period of time will produce a particular value of total angular momentum
stored onboard the spacecraft, resident in the rotating wheel or wheels, depending
on how many axes are controlled. When it is spinning as fast as it can with the
given motor drive, the wheel becomes “saturated,” and cannot further
compensate external torques. If further such torques are applied, the spacecraft
will tumble. In practice it is desirable to avoid operation of a reaction wheel at

ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL 357 
speeds near saturation, not only because of the limited control authority but also 
because of the substantial jitter that is typically generated by an electric motor 
operating at maximum speed. 
Because reaction wheels can only store, and not remove, the sum of 
environmental torques imposed on the spacecraft, it is necessary periodically to 
impose upon the spacecraft a counteracting extemal torque to compensate for the 
accumulated onboard momentum. Known as "momentum dumping," this can be 
done by magnetic torquers (useful in LEO) or by control jets (in high orbit or 
about planets not having a magnetic field). Magnetic torquing as a means of 
momentum dumping is greatly to be preferred, because when jets are used, the 
complexities of a second system and the problems of a limited consumable 
resource are introduced. Indeed, in many cases when jets must be used, reaction 
wheels will lose much of their inherent utility, and the designer must weigh their 
drawbacks against their many positive features, among which are precision and 
reliability, particularly in the newer versions that make use of magnetic rather 
than mechanical bearings. 
A reaction wheel operating about a given spacecraft axis has a straightforward 
control logic. If an undesirable motion about a particular axis is sensed, the 
spacecraft commands the reaction wheel to rotate in a countervailing sense. The 
correction torque is computed as an appropriately weighted combination of 
position error and rate error. That is, the more the spacecraft is out of position, 
and the faster it is rotating out of position, the larger will be the computed 
correction torque. 
. As long as all of the axes having reaction wheels are mutually orthogonal, the 
control laws for each axis will be simple and straightforward. If full redundancy 
is desired, however, this approach has the disadvantage of requiring two wheels 
for each axis, bringing a penalty in power, weight, and expense to operate 
the system. A more common approach today is to mount four reaction wheels in 
the form of a tetrahedron, coupling all wheels into all spacecraft axes. Any three 
wheels can then be used to control the spacecraft, the fourth wheel being 
redundant, allowing failure of any single wheel while substantially increasing 
momentum storage when all wheels are working. Thus, the system can operate 
for a longer period before needing to dump momentum. 
Although reaction wheels operate by varying wheel speed in response to the 
imposition of extemal torques, that does not mean that the average speed of the 
wheels must necessarily be zero. The wheels can also be operated around a 
nominal low speed (possibly a few rpm) in what is called a momentum-bias 
system. The momentum-bias configuration has several advantages. It avoids the 
problem of having the wheel go through zero speed from, say, a minus direction 
to a plus direction in response to torques on the spacecraft. This in turn avoids the 
problem of sticking friction (stiction) on the wheel when it is temporarily 
stopped. 
Because of the nonlinearity of the stiction term, the response of wheels to a 
control torque will be nonlinear in the region around zero speed, imposing a

speeds near saturation, not only because of the limited control authority but also
because of the substantial jitter that is typically generated by an electric motor
operating at maximum speed.

Because reaction wheels can only store, and not remove, the sum of

impose upon the spacecraft a counteracting external torque to compensate for the
accumulated onboard momentum. Known as “momentum dumping,” this can be
done by magnetic torquers (useful in LEO) or by control jets (in high orbit or
about planets not having a magnetic field). Magnetic torquing as a means of
momentum dumping is greatly to be preferred, because when jets are used, the
complexities of a second system and the problems of a limited consumable

spacecraft commands the reaction wheel to rotate in a countervailing sense. The
correction torque is computed as an appropriately weighted combination of

to a plus direction in response to torques on the spacecraft. This in turn avoids the
problem of sticking friction (stiction) on the wheel when it is temporarily
stopped.

Because of the nonlinearity of the stiction term, the response of wheels to a
control torque will be nonlinear in the region around zero speed, imposing a

358 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
jerking or otherwise irregular motion on the spacecraft as it goes through this 
region.17 If this poses a problem in maintaining accurate, jitter-free control of the 
spacecraft, then the system designer may favor a momentum-bias system, which 
avoids the region around zero. As a disadvantage, the momentum-bias system 
lowers the total control authority available to the wheel before the saturation 
torque limit is reached, forcing momentum to be dumped from the spacecraft 
more frequently. 
7.7.3 Momentum Wheels 
When a reaction wheel is intended to operate at a relatively high speed 
(perhaps several tens of revolutions per minute), then a change of both 
terminology and control logic is employed. The spacecraft is said to possess a 
momentum wheel; a tachometer-based control loop maintains wheel speed at a 
nominally constant value with respect to the spacecraft body. This speed is 
adjusted slightly up or down in response to external torques. When the range of 
these adjustments exceeds what the control-system designer has set as the limit, 
momentum dumping allows the wheel speed to be brought back into the desired 
range. When magnetic coils are used to unload the wheel, this is done more or 
less continuously so that the tachometer circuit can operate around an essentially 
constant nominal value. 
Use of a momentum wheel on a spacecraft offers the advantage of substantial 
gyroscopic stability. That is, a given level of disturbance torque will produce a 
much smaller change in desired nominal position of the spacecraft because of the 
relatively small percentage change it makes in the total spacecraft angular 
momentum vector. For this reason momentum-wheel systems are generally 
confined to use on spacecraft requiring a relatively consistent pointing direction. 
An example might be a low-orbit satellite where it is desired to have the vehicle 
angular momentum vector directed more or less continuously along the positive 
orbit normal, and to have the body of the spacecraft rotate slowly (i-e., 
0.000175 Hz) to keep one side always facing the Earth. Use of a momentum 
wheel on the spacecraft aligned with its angular momentum vector along the orbit 
normal would be a common approach to such a requirement. The tachometer 
wheel control loop would function to keep the slowly rotating body facing 
correctly toward Earth. 
The momentum-wheel system described here represents an attitude-control 
design referred to as a dual-spin configuration (Fig. 7.17). This configuration 
exists whenever a spacecraft contains two bodies rotating at different rates about 
a common axis. Then the spacecraft behaves in some ways like a spinner, but a 
part of it, such as an antenna or sensor on the outer shell, can be pointed more or 
less continuously in a desired direction. 
As with simple spinners, dual-spin spacecraft require onboard devices such as 
jets or magnetic torquers for control of the overall momentum magnitude and 
direction. A reaction-wheel system offers the advantages of high-precision,

maximum moment of inertia. But if the designer deliberately provides more 
energy dissipation on the despun platform than in the spinning portion of the 
spacecraft, the flat-spin condition may not be the only low-energy position of 
stable equilibrium. This can allow spinning the spacecraft about the minor axis of

7.7.4 Control Moment Gyros 
Momentum wheels can be used in yet another configuration, as control 
moment gyros (CMG). The CMG is basically a gimballed momentum wheel, as 
shown in Fig. 7.18, with the gimbal fixed perpendicular to the spin axis of the 
wheel.*' A torque applied at the gimbal produces a change in the angular 
momentum perpendicular to the existing angular-momentum vector H, and thus a 
reaction torque on the body. Control moment gyros are relatively heavy, but can 
provide congo1 authority higher by a factor of 100 or more than can reaction 
wheels. Besides imposing a weight penalty, CMGs tend to be relatively noisy in 
an attitude control sense, with resonances at frequencies that are multiples of the 
spin rate. 
In many applications not requiring the ultimate in precision pointing, 
however, CMGs offer an excellent high-authority attitude control mechanism 
without the use of consumables such as reaction gas. The most notable use of 
control moment gyros in the U.S. space program has been the Skylab spacecraft 
launched in 1973 and occupied by three crews of Apollo astronauts during 1973 
and 1974. In more recent times, the Russian Mir space station program has used 
similar devices for vehicle stabilization, as does the International Space Station. 
7.7.5 Magnetic Torquers 
A spacecraft orbiting at relatively low altitude about a planet with an 
appreciable magnetic field can make effective use of magnetic torquers, 
particularly for initial attitude acquisition maneuvers and for dumping excess 
angular momentum from reaction wheels. They prove particularly advantageous

regard, the HST, must have its primary mirror kept as clean as possible. As 
drawbacks, magnetic torquers have relatively low control authority and can 
interfere with other components on the spacecraft. 
7.7.6 Reaction Jets 
Reaction-control jets are a common and effective means of providing 
spacecraft attitude control. They are standard equipment on manned spacecraft 
because they can quickly exert large control forces. They are also common on 
satellites intended to operate in relatively high orbit, where a magnetic field will 
not be available for angular-momentum dumping. Offsetting these advantages, 
reaction-control jets use consumables, such as a neutral gas (e.g., Freon or 
nitrogen) or hydrazine in either monopropellant or bipropellant systems. 
Normally on/off operated, they do not readily lend themselves to proportional 
control, although that is possible by using pulse lengths of varying duration or a 
mix of control jets, not all of which need to be used in every situation. It is usually 
not acceptable to have only one jet functioning for a given control axis, because 
its failure will leave the spacecraft disabled in that axis. Thus, jet control systems 
usually require redundant thrusters, which leads to complex plumbing and 
control. Also, when attitude jets are used, there will likely be some coupling 
between the attitude and translation control systems. Unless a pure couple is 
introduced by opposing jets about the spacecraft's center of mass, the intended 
attitude control maneuver will also produce a small component through the 
spacecraft's center of mass. This will result in an orbital perturbation.

7.8.1 Attitude Determfnatfon Concepts 
We now consider spacecraft attitude determination, the process of deriving 
estimates of actual spacecraft attitude from measurements. Note that we use the 
term "estimates." Complete determination is not possible; there will always be 
some error, as discussed in the introductory sections of this chapter. 
ADCS engineers treat two broad categories of attitude measurements.

spacecraft axis in space (often, but not always, the spin axis of either a simple

of as single-axis attitude determination plus a rotational, or clock, angle about

The selection of a particular damping ratio ¢ and natural frequency w, forces
the choice of gains K, and K,. This choice can be made to a certain extent at
the discretion of the control-system designer, depending on which performance
criteria are most important in a given circumstance. However, for such simple
systems there are long-standing criteria by which the feedback gains are chosen
to obtain the most appropriate compromise among the various parameters such as
overshoot, settling time, etc. 2

for a second-order system when 22m, = ./2¢w,. Thus we find { = ./2/2=0.707,
and w, > 4/¢=4./2 rad/s. The system gains K, and K, are found from
Egs. (7.54) and (7.55). Higher values of w, than the minimum would produce a
shorter settling time and might be desirable provided stability can be attained.

7.8 Attitude Determination

7.8.1 Attitude Determination Concepts

We now consider spacecraft attitude determination, the process of deriving
estimates of actual spacecraft attitude from measurements. Note that we use the
term “estimates.” Complete determination is not possible; there will always be
some error, as discussed in the introductory sections of this chapter.

ADCS engineers treat two broad categories of attitude measurements.
The first, single-axis attitude determination, seeks the orientation of a single
spacecraft axis in space (often, but not always, the spin axis of either a simple
spinner or a dual-spin spacecraft). The other, three-axis attitude determination,
seeks the complete orientation of the body in inertial space. This may be thought
of as single-axis attitude determination plus a rotational, or clock, angle about
that axis.

Single-axis attitude determination results when sensors yield an arclength
measurement (see Fig. 7.7) between the sensor boresight and the known reference

point. The reference point may be the sun, tiie Earth nadir position, the moon, or a 
star. The crucial point is that only an arc-length magnitude is known, rather than a 
magnitude and direction. Specification of the axis orientation with respect to 
inertial space then theoretically requires three independent measurements to 
obtain a sufficient number of parameters for the measurement. In practice, the 
engineer often selects two independent measurements together with a scheme to 
choose between the true solution and a false (image) solution caused by the 
underspecification of parameters. The most common scheme entails using an a 
priori estimate of the true attitude and choosing the measurement that comes 
closest to the assumed value. Figure 7.20 illustrates the concept. 
To effect the three-axis attitude determination requires two vectors that can be 
measured in the spacecraft body frame and have known values in the inertial 
reference frame. Examples of such potentially known vectors include, again, the 
sun, the stars, and the Earth nadir. The key lies in the type of sensor used to effect 
the measurement rather than in the nature of the reference point. The sensor must 
measure not merely a simple boresight error, as in single-axis attitude 
determination, but two angular components of the error vector. The third vector 
component is known since only unit vectors need be considered in spacecraft 
attitude control. 
Consider that u and v are measured line-of-sight vectors to known stars in 
spacecraft body coordinates. We can define a unitary triplet of column vectors i, j,

J determination schemes therefore make substantial engineering sense in such 
cases. 
The most common means of determining the Earth nadir vector employs 
horizon scanners. With the position of the horizon defined on each side of the 
spacecraft, and to its fore and aft positions, the subsatellite point or nadir will be 
readily defined. Although a variety of sensors have been used in this application, 
the most common operate in the 14- 16 pm infrared band. This is the so-called 
COz band, characteristic of the carbon dioxide layer in the Earth's upper 
atmosphere. This relatively well-defined annospheric band is usable both day and 
night, irrespective of the cloud layer. For these reasons the C02 band makes an 
especially good attitude reference within the Earth's atmosphere. 
The 15 pm horizon varies by as much as 20 km from point to point on the 
Earth's surface, or between daylight and darkness, or at different times of the 
year. For low-orbiting spacecraft this alone produces an angle accuracy limit of 
around 0.05" in either pitch or roll. When the various known and normally 
modeIed effects, including the Earth's oblateness (discussed in Chapter 4) are 
taken into account, angular accuracies can be on the order of 0.02-0.03" using 
Earth horizon sensors. 
The most common types of Earth horizon sensors feature small scanners 
attached to a wheel oriented to rotate around the spacecraft's pitch axis. The 
scanners angle outward somewhat from Earth's nadir direction but not so far that 
they miss the outer edge of the Enrth's horizon. 
On each rotational scan in the pitch axis, therefore, each sensor will record a 
rising pulse and a falling pulse as the Earth's horizon is encountered going from 
cold space, across the Earth, and then back into cold space. Because the wheel 
speed is known and controlled by a tachometer circuit, the timing of these pulses, 
when compared against the reference time at which the pulses should occur, can 
be used to measure spacecraft pitch angle. 
Additionally, if the scanners are mounted symmetrically on the spacecraft and 
if the roll angle is zero, then each scanner will have exactly the same duration 
between pulses. Any difference between the periods of pulse separation on either 
side of the spacecraft can be used to deduce the spacecraft roll angle. Figure 7.22 
illustrates the geometry. 
Spacecraft yaw angle, the rotational position around the radius vector from the 
Earth, cannot be determined using the measurements described earlier, because 
the Earth appears circular from the spacecraft no matter what the yaw angle might 
be. In inertial space, however, the yaw angle at a given moment is the same angle 
that will be observed as a roll angle one-fourth of an orbit later. Thus, spacecraft 
roll information can be used to estimate yaw, albeit on a very low bandwidth 
basis. 
We have discussed horizon sensors for use in pairs, but a single scanner can 
provide excellent pitch information and adequate roll information. This allows 
graceful degradation in the event of a failure in one of the pair. However, 
extraction of roll information from one scanner requires knowledge of the orbital

determination schemes therefore make substantial engineering sense in such
cases.

The most common means of determining the Earth nadir vector employs
horizon scanners. With the position of the horizon defined on each side of the
spacecraft, and to its fore and aft positions, the subsatellite point or nadir will be
readily defined. Although a variety of sensors have been used in this application,
the most common operate in the 14-16 ym infrared band. This is the so-called
CO, band, characteristic of the carbon dioxide layer in the Earth’s upper
atmosphere. This relatively well-defined atmospheric band is usable both day and
night, irrespective of the cloud layer. For these reasons the CO, band makes an
especially good attitude reference within the Earth’s atmosphere.

The 15 um horizon varies by as much as 20 km from point to point on the
Earth’s surface, or between daylight and darkness, or at different times of the
year. For low-orbiting spacecraft this alone produces an angle accuracy limit of
around 0.05° in either pitch or roll. When the various known and normally
modeled effects, including the Earth’s oblateness (discussed in Chapter 4) are
taken into account, angular accuracies can be on the order of 0.02—0.03° using
Earth horizon sensors.

The most common types of Earth horizon sensors feature smal] scanners
attached to a wheel oriented to rotate around the spacecraft’s pitch axis. The
scanners angle outward somewhat from Earth’s nadir direction but not so far that
they miss the outer edge of the Earth’s horizon.

On each rotational scan in the pitch axis, therefore, each sensor will record a
rising pulse and a falling pulse as the Earth’s horizon is encountered going from
cold space, across the Earth, and then back into cold space. Because the wheel
speed is known and controlled by a tachometer circuit, the timing of these pulses,
when compared against the reference time at which the pulses should occur, can
be used to measure spacecraft pitch angle.

Additionally, if the scanners are mounted symmetrically on the spacecraft and
if the roll angle is zero, then each scanner will have exactly the same duration
between pulses. Any difference between the periods of pulse separation on either
side of the spacecraft can be used to deduce the spacecraft roll angle. Figure 7.22
illustrates the geometry.

Spacecraft yaw angle, the rotational position around the radius vector from the
Earth, cannot be determined using the measurements described earlier, because
the Earth appears circular from the spacecraft no matter what the yaw angle might
be. In inertial space, however, the yaw angle at a given moment is the same angle
that will be observed as a roll angle one-fourth of an orbit later. Thus, spacecraft
roll information can be used to estimate yaw, albeit on a very low bandwidth

Equation (7.60) provides a vector known in inertial space as a function of the 
satellite's position in orbit and against which a measurement made in spacecraft 
body coordinates may be compared. The typical precision of a magnetic field 
based attitude determination measurement is on the order of 1-2". 
The most accurate source for a reference vector to use in spacecraft attitude 
determination is a fixed star of known catalog position. Star trackers offer the 
potential of absolute attitude determination accuracy down to the order of 
approximately an arc-second, roughly the precision of most star-catalog data. 
However, this is obtained at relatively high cost, not only in dollars but also in 
power, weight, and onboard processing required to use the information returned 
by the tracker. Star trackers impose additional operational penalties in that they 
are obviously sensitive to light from the sun and reflected light'from the Earth, the 
moon, and stray objects that may appear in the field of view. 
Many different types of star trackers have been built. Gimballed trackers point 
at a star and maintain the star in a centered position. The star angles in body 
coordinates are then read from the gimbals. Such trackers offer great precision 
and a very wide effective field of regard, but use many moving parts and are quite 
cumbersome. They are thus rarely seen in current use. More commonly used 
today, so-called fixed-head star trackers scan the star field either electronically or 
by means of the spacecraft's motion. These trackers use no moving parts but have 
a relatively narrow field of view, on the order of 5-10". 
The operational problem of star identification and verification is not trivial. 
Modem trackers employ processing logic internal to the tracker and can catalog 
stars according to both brightness and spectral type. The ADCS designer 
typically prefers to use only the brighter stars, both to minimize tracking error due 
to noise and to minimize potential confusion between similar stars in the catalog. 
However, to use stars sufficiently bright (third or fourth visual magnitude) to 
minimize confusion, the time gaps between appropriate star observations may be 
as much as 15 min to a half-hour, depending on the spacecraft orbit and the 
number and orientation of star trackers. If dimmer stars-clown to seventh or 
eighth magnitude-are used, then there are nearly always appropriate stars in the 
field of view, but by the same token their identification and verification presents a 
problem. Moreover, even if the stars can be unambiguously identified, a much 
larger catalog will be required for onboard storage, at a substantially greater 
investment of time in loading and debugging the attitude determination software. 
Long gaps between suitable star observations pose problems for an attitude 
control system not unlike those associated with sun outage in attitude 
determination using sun sensors. To address this problem, star trackers having 
a very wide field of view (e.g., 60" cone angle) have recently been developed. 
These trackers use only the brighter stars (e.g., third or fourth magnitude or 
brighter), but compensate for the existence of fewer such stars with the large field 
of view (FOV). Instead of merely supplying the coordinates of individual stars

within the FOV, companion software identifies specific "constellations" or 
known groups of stars (not the classical constellations of human experience). 
Using these star groups, a single tracker can identify both a boresight pointing 
vector and a rotational angle about that vector, thus providing full three-axis 
attitude determination with a single sensor. 
As a practical matter, if the attitude control designei must handle gaps of 
several minutes or more between suitable stars, then gyroscopes will be needed 
on the spacecraft to provide an attitude reference during periods when no star is in 
the field of view of one of the trackers. Indeed, in such a case the preferred control 
algorithm will normally feature the use of rate gyros to measure the rotational 
rates around the various spacecraft axes. These rates will then be inkgrated over a 
period of time to establish the spacecraft's rotational position starting from a 
known baseline. When a suitable star is in the field of view of one of the trackers, 
or if Earth horizon scanners or sun sensors are also used, angular position updates 
are available to recalibrate the gyros. The system operates in this fashion more or 
less continuously, using gyros for high-bandwidth vehicle control and other 
attitude sensors to update the angular position reference. With this procedure, one 
is actually flying the spacecraft from a gyro reference platform and updating 
the navigational accuracy of the platform as targets of opportunity for attitude 
reference come into the field of view of one or more spacecraft sensors. 
A classical gyroscope makes use of the fact that the angular momentum vector 
of a spinning body is constant unless an external torque is imposed on it. The 
gyroscope may be suspended in a nested set of gimbals and the whole assembly 
inserted into the spacecraft. The rotational motion of the spacecraft with respect 
to the gyroscope, which is fixed in space, is noted by measuring the change in 
gimbal angles with respect to the spacecraft. As with gimballed star trackers, this 
approach provides the highest accuracy available. 
However, it is more common and nearly as accurate to use a "strapdown" 
platform. In such a platform the gyroscope is kept in more or less the same 
position relative to its assembly and to the spacecraft body by means of a control 
loop that supplies the torque necessary to keep the rotor in the correct position. 
The applied torqde needed to maintain equilibrium is known by the electronic 
logic and used as a measure of the torques that have actually been imposed on the 
spacecraft body. Gyros may be configured to measure either rate or integrated 
rate (position), and may provide either one or two degrees of freedom for making 
a measurement. 
Gyroscopes can provide extremely high bandwidth and extremely sensitive 
attitude or attitude-rate information. In many ways they make ideal components 
in an attitude-determination and control system. As noted earlier, they do require 
periodic recalibration from star trackers, sun sensors, or Earth horizon scanners, 
to remove the effects of drift and other systematic errors resulting from the fact 
that the gyro rotor cannot be maintained in truly torque-free motion. The models 
of highest accuracy are heavy, and all models have traditionally been rather 
expensive. 
ATTITUDE DETERMINATION AND CONTROL 371

within the FOV, companion software identifies specific “constellations” or
known groups of stars (not the classical constellations of human experience).
Using these star groups, a single tracker can identify both a boresight pointing
vector and a rotational angle about that vector, thus providing full three-axis
attitude determination with a single sensor. .

As a practical matter, if the attitude control designer must handle gaps of
several minutes or more between suitable stars, then gyroscopes will be needed
on the spacecraft to provide an attitude reference during periods when no star is in
the field of view of one of the trackers. Indeed, in such a case the preferred control
algorithm will normally feature the use of rate gyros to measure the rotational
rates around the various spacecraft axes. These rates will then be integrated over a
period of time to establish the spacecraft’s rotational position starting from a
known baseline. When a suitable star is in the field of view of one of the trackers,
or if Earth horizon scanners or sun sensors are also used, angular position updates
are available to recalibrate the gyros. The system operates in this fashion more or
less continuously, using gyros for high-bandwidth vehicle control and other
attitude sensors to update the angular position reference. With this procedure, one
is actually flying the spacecraft from a gyro reference platform and updating
the navigational accuracy of the platform as targets of opportunity for attitude

Gyro systems have Wn designed to last many years on orbit. However, it is 
fair to say that individual unit failures are not uncommon, and that system level 
robustness is generally obtained through the use of individually redundant units. 
The limitations of conventional electromechanical gyroscopes have been well 
understood for many decades. For this reason, since the mid-1960s, there has 
been interest in replacing conventional gyros with inertial rate-measuring devices 
that use different underlying principles. These include ring-laser, laser fibet- I 
optic, and hemispherical-resonator gyroscopes (the name "gyroscope" applied to 
such devices is a misnomer, but has wide currency). 
Fiber-optic and ring-laser gyros provide a closed path around which laser light 
can be sent h opposite directions from a laser source. When the closed path 
(loop) is rotated relative to inertial space, the counter-rotating beams of light , 
experience slightly different path lengths depending on which direction they have 
traveled. When the two beams are brought together at the end of the path, one will 
be slightly out of phase with respect to the other. The amount of .the phase 
difference depends on the rotational rate applied to the closed loop. t 
The advantages of laser gyros have sparked development of them for various 
airborne and spacecraft applications. They have few moving parts, very high 
levels of reliability, and are inherently robust, capable of withstanding much 
rougher treatment than most mechanical systems. Fiberoptic gyros in particular 
can be made quite compact. For these and other reasons, aircraft and spacecraft 
designers have for some time been moving away from electromechanical gyros 
and toward such newer concepts. This is exemplified by the standard use of ring- 
laser gyros in aircraft such as the Boeing 757 and 767 series. Laser gyros were 
included as the baseline inertial navigation platform on the Orbital Sciences 
Corporation Transfer Orbit Stage as early as the late 1980s. The Near-Earth 
Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission to the asteroid Eros featured the first use 
of solid-state gyros on an interplanetary mission. Nevertheless, despite these 
successes, laser and other innovative gyro types have yet to see full acceptance in 
the aerospace industry, and electromechanical gyros can be expected to remain in 
heavy application for a long time. 
The advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation (see Chapter 1 1) 
offers the possibility, especially for large spacecraft in Earth orbit, of very precise 
and economical (in terms not only of money, but also of mass, power, and 
volume) attitude determination, along with basic spacecraft navigation. In this

designer's responsibility end, with the selection of measurement and control 
methods and components to implement them; that may indeed be the easiest part 
of the task. Many system-level considerations confront the ADCS designer. 
These must be addressed before the spacecraft can be ready to fly, or even before 
the ADCS can be properly related to the remaining subsystems aboard the 
spacecraft.

errors that are inevitable in translating any idealized approach into practice, or 
which arise as a consequence of simplifying the real world to a model for use in 
design and analyses. Nowhere is this truer than in attitude detennination and 
control systems. For example, throughout this chapter it has been assumed that 
the spacecraft coordinate system will be anchored in the spacecraft's center of 
mass. This may be true in principle, because the coordinate system can always be 
redefined if necessary to fit the actual center-of-mass location; but the attitude 
control system actuators and the attitude determination system sensors will have 
been located with respect to the intended spacecraft-body-axis frame supposedly 
located in the center of mass. 
Because offsets between the center of mass and the .geometric center will 
always exist, it follows that there will inevitably be a coupling between attitude 
control and translational maneuvers. That is, thrusters intended to effect 
translational motion (to impart AV) will inevitably alter the attitude. This must be 
compensated by the attitude control system during AV maneuvers, and indeed it 
may well be that the attitude control system's overall control authority is 
determined on the basis of expected center-of-mass and center-of-thrust offsets 
for the AV system. Similarly, the use of attitude thrusters to control the rotational

of the task. Many system-level considerations confront the ADCS designer.
These must be addressed before the spacecraft can be ready to fly, or even before

position of a spacecraft will usually impart a residual AV to the spacecraft, 
probably causing an undesired orbital perturbation. 
Another assumption throughout this chapter (and usually in the real world) is I 
that of an essentially rigid spacecraft body to which are attached the various parts 
and components that make up the complete system. In practice no spacecraft 
structure or component attached to it will ever be perfectly rigid. This has obvious 
and well-understood effects with regard to the major-axis spin rule, as discussed I 
earlier. Additional and more subtle effects are present, the most important being 
the potential for interaction between structural flexibility and the attitude 
determination and control system.22 
This situation has been depicted conceptually in Fig. 7.24, showing a sensor 
mounted through a spring-like attachment to the spacecraft body. As the 
spacecraft moves in response to attitude control maneuvers, there will be relative 
motion between the attitude determination sensor and the spacecraft body. The 
sensor will not register the correct angle between the spacecraft's body axis and 
the desired reference source, and its error will be fed back into the spacecraft 
control system and used to cause an additional maneuver, which will again 
deflect the sensor relative to the spacecraft. The process continues ad infinitum. In 
short, the feedback signal has become corrupted by the relative deflection 
between the spacecraft body and the attitude determination sensor. The phasing 
of this error can cause the entire loop to become unstable. In practice, the 
spacecraft designer desires to remove the effects of structural flexibility to the 
maximum extent possible. This is done by using the most rigid mounting possible 
between various spacecraft components and also by using attachments that will 
provide as much damping as possible. 
However, as spacecraft primary structures become larger and larger, the 
fundamental modal frequency inevitably becomes lower and lower, to a point 
where not uncommonly the fundamental structural modes fall near or within the

desired attitude control system bandwidth. This is not an acceptable situation. 
The spacecraft fundamental structural modes and the attitude control system 
bandwidth must be separated to the maximum extent practical; this usually means 
a factor of five or more (and more is definitely better) separation between the 
ADCS passband and the lowest-order structural mode. Thus, a 2-Hz ADCS 
passband would require that the structural modes be at 10 Hz or above, and even 
greater separation is desirable when it can be achieved. If this cannot be done 
either by stiffening the spacecraft or lowering the control bandwidth, then the 
spacecraft structural modes themselves must be modeled as part of the overall 
attitude control loop. Development of control systems for flexible spacecraft has 
been an important research topic for several decades, and as spacecraft have 
become larger, it has acquired great practical moment. The literature is replete 
with examples of both theoretical and applied developments relating spacecraft 
attitude control and structural interactions. 
So far, this chapter has mainly concerned design of systems to measure 
spacecraft attitude and to control it about some nominal point, which has 
implicitly been assumed to be constant. This in fact may be the easiest part of the 
mission operator's problem. In contrast, the question of how and in what way to 
maneuver the spacecraft between one desired attitude and another can be a major 
issue. Provision in the spacecraft design for such attitude maneuvers strongly 
effects spacecraft control through development of both onboard and ground 
operations software. At the very least, provisions must be made for initial 
acquisition maneuvers following depIoyment of the spacecraft from its launch 
vehicle, and delicate sensors or instruments cannot usually be allowed to point at 
the sun, or in many cases at the Earth or even the moon. 
Furthermore, if the spacecraft has a very flexible operating profile, with more 
than one intended target of observation (such as would be the case, for example, 
with an astronomical telescope), then the designer's goal must include the ability 
to execute an equally flexible set of attitude maneuvers. The attitude-maneuver 
design must consider other spacecraft subsystems as well as the attitude system. 
A solar power system may need to have the arrays pointed toward the sun, and the 
arrays may need articulation individually to compensate for spacecraft 
maneuvers. Thermal radiators may need to be oriented toward dark space, or 
at least not toward the sun, while antennas may be required to point continuously 
toward Earth. As an excellent example of Murphy's Law, ground controllers 
want uninterrupted communication with the spacecraft at the exact time, during 
an attitude maneuver, when it is most difficult to achieve. 
Similarly, the vehicle's scientific sensors or other systems often cannot look at 
the Earth or the sun without at least intempting operation or, in the worst case, 
being irrepairably damaged. Furthermore, attitude maneuvers usually must be 
conducted with reasonable fuel efficiency. In other cases it may be required to 
minimize the time to execute a maneuver. Thus, design of optimal attitude 
maneuvers subject to known constraints on the spacecraft has been the subject of

We close this chapter with a few comments on testing. Few tasks are more 
challenging to the ADCS designer than testing his system. To be as realistic as 
possible, the system must be tested in essentially its operational configuration. 
However, the spacecraft is intended to operate in Og and vacuum, not at lg in the 
atmosphere. Air bearing tables can be useful in simulating Og behavior, but 
cannot replicate the extremely low damping of the vacuum environment. It is also 
difficult (though not impossible for small systems) to devise an air bearing 
arrangement to allow simultaneous testing of all three axes. Attitude sensor 
inputs are also difficult to replicate on the ground, even in space simulation 
chambers. Given the uncertainties that are present, it is not surprising that getting 
the attitude determination and control system to behave properly is often the 
major task following initial deployment of the spacecraft in orbit.

positive or negative orbit normal direction, depending on the 
considerations discussed in the following. The spacecraft is designed to 
radiate heat to dark space out of the "bottom" side. Because of the nodal 
regression of the orbit, and the consequent time-varying angle between the 
sun vector and the orbit plane, it is necessary several times per year to 
"invert" the spacecraft, i.e., to precess the spin axis around to the opposite 
orbit normal direction, so that the sun does not shine into the bottom side. 
The spin axis attitude is controlled by four 50-N thrusters mounted on the 
rim of the spacecraft. The thrusters are operated in pulse mode, with a 
pulse width of 40 ms, followed by a 60-ms off-period. How many thruster 
pulses are required to accomplish this? How long does the process take? 
Because of the short pulse, we may ignore any cosine losses associated 
with finite pulse width. 
7.6 The spacecraft outlined in problem 7.5 has thrusters that are slightly 
misaligned, a consequence of which is that a coning motion develops 
during the described yaw inversion maneuver. The spacecraft is 
symmetric about the spin axis, with I, = I, = 300 kg - m2 and, as stated 
in problem 7.5, 1, = 500 kg - mZ. A precession rate of 11 rad/s is 
developed; what is the precession angle? 
7.7 When Voyager 2, a three-axis stabilized spacecraft with 0 angular 
momentum (see Fig. 8.1), was in cruise phase just past the orbit of Saturn 
(10 A.U. from the sun), controllers began to notice a small but persistent 
attitude motion drift away from its nominal solar-inertial attitude. 
(Voyager was flown with its dish antenna oriented essentially toward the 
sun; this automatically kept Earth within the antenna beamwidth.) The 
spacecraft showed a consistent pattern of drifting away from an initially 
stationary position at one side of its control "deadband" to the control limit 
on the other side of the deadband. At this point, a small thruster would be 
fired to bounce the spacecraft attitude back toward the other side of the 
deadband. The deadband was 4" wide, and the drift motion required two 
hours to go from the stationary position at one limit to the opposite limit. 
What was the net external torque on the spacecraft if its moment of inertia 
in the plane of the motion was 500 kg - m2? It was assumed that solar 
radiation torque was the culprit, because of Voyager's unsymmetrically 
mounted booms. If so, and assuming a projected area of 10 m2 with 50% 
reflectivity, what was the effective center-of-mass to center-of-pressure 
(CM-CP) offset? At 1 AU, p, = 4.4 x ~/m~.

Configuration and Structural Design 
8.1 Introduction 
Of all the subsystem areas discussed in this book, configuration design may 
most closely approximate systems engineering as a whole. The configuration 
designer must be involved in detail with every other subsystem in the spacecraft. 
The configuration must accommodate all the disparate requirements and desires 
of the various subsystems and, where those are in conflict, reach a suitable 
compromise. For a complex spacecraft, the wide variety of requirements, desires, 
and constraints and the conflicts that inevitably arise among them provide a 
substantial challenge. This fact is not new to mechanical and structural designers, 
but space applications do present a set of challenges extending well beyond the 
reach of conventional ground-based techniques.' A variety of innovative 
solutions have evolved in various projects. These will be discussed in some 
detail, not as final answers, but simply as examples of working solutions. 
8.2 Design Drivers 
Before discussing solutions, we need to understand the factors that drive the 
design. It can be stated as an axiom that configuration design is always a 
compromise. A variety of requirements, which invariably involve some conflict, 
drive the design of every spacecraft. As with any complex system, there usually 
exists a variety of solutions, each of which can result in a more or less satisfactory 
design. As a result, this section will discuss the design drivers and some of the 
considerations involved in developing solutions.

Configuration and Structural Design

8.1. Introduction

Of all the subsystem areas discussed in this book, configuration design may
most closely approximate systems engineering as a whole. The configuration
designer must be involved in detail with every other subsystem in the spacecraft.
The configuration must accommodate all the disparate requirements and desires
of the various subsystems and, where those are in conflict, reach a suitable
compromise. For a complex spacecraft, the wide variety of requirements, desires,
and constraints and the conflicts that inevitably arise among them provide a
substantial challenge. This fact is not new to mechanical and structural designers,
but space applications do present a set of challenges extending well beyond the
reach of conventional ground-based techniques.' A variety of innovative
solutions have evolved in various projects. These will be discussed in some
detail, not as final answers, but simply as examples of working solutions.

8.2 Design Drivers

Before discussing solutions, we need to understand the factors that drive the
design. It can be stated as an axiom that configuration design is always a
compromise. A variety of requirements, which invariably involve some conflict,
drive the design of every spacecraft. As with any complex system, there usually
exists a variety of solutions, each of which can result in a more or less satisfactory
design. As a result, this section will discuss the design drivers and some of the
considerations involved in developing solutions.

8.2.1 Mission Goals

A variety of typical missions can be listed to illustrate the types of missions
that can be carried out by any spacecraft. The common generic classes of
spacecraft missions and goals are 1) communications relay; 2) Earth observation,

8.2.1.1 Communications satellites. Communications satellites have 
historically been located almost exclusively in geostationary orbit because of 
the wide area of coverage available and the simplicity of communicating with an 
object that remains stationary in the sky. Because ground stations require no I 
tracking capability, construction and operating costs are substantially reduced. 
The need merely to point accurately in one direction and perform only a relatively 
simple relay function also simplifies the spacecraft. On the other hand, the very 
large number of channels handled by a modem communications satellite 
effectively complicates the avionics design, while the large investment involved 
and the importance of the function dictates very high reliability and long life. 
Recently, interest has grown in using networks of low-altitude satellites that 
replace the geostationary type. The low-altitude constellations may offer lower unit 
costs, but require a very large number of satellites and some increase in operational 
complexity. The major advantage of this approach is in its robustness. Loss of a 
substantial percentage of the satellites will result in a degraded but functional 
system, whereas loss of a single large satellite will shut down the entire system. 
Because much of its temtory lies at the high latitudes poorly served from 
geostationary orbit, Russia has evolved the Molniya communications spacecraft. 
These spacecraft operate in highly elliptic synchronous orbits oriented so that the 
apoapsis is located over the regions of interest. Thus, the spacecraft spends most 
of its time above the horizon as viewed from Russia. As discussed in Chapter 4, 
by selecting an inclination of 63.5 deg it is possible to prevent the line of apsides 
from precessing. Thus the desired orientation relative to the Russian landmass is 
maintained throughout the year. 
8.2.1.2 Earth observation satellites. With the possible exception of 
communications satellites, Earth observation satellites are probably the most 
common general type of spacecraft currently in existence. Both military 
and civilian versions exist. Operating orbits range from low circular through 
elliptic to geostationary and beyond. Even though they all carry out the same 
generic function (i.e., they observe the Earth and its near environment), the 
variety of spacecraft is huge, with many types of sensors operating in a variety of 
wavelengths. Most are passive, i.e., they conduct their observations using 
naturally emitted radiation. A few conduct active observations using radar or 
lidar (laser radar). 
The type of Earth observation spacecraft most familiar to the casual observer 
is the weather satellite. Both military and civilian agencies operate networks of 
these spacecraft. The military and civilian spacecraft are generally similar, 
although specific requirements may result in some differences in sensors or 
operations. Two generic types of weather satellites exist: those located in 
geostationary orbit to provide wide area coverage (almost 40% of the Earth from

onelsatellite) and those in low circular polar orbit that provide high-resolution 
data, but over smaller viewing arcs. The latter are usually in sun-synchronous 
orbit (see Chapter 4) so that a given locality is viewed at the same local time 
(hence sun angle) each day. The low-orbit spacecraft are generally nadir- 
pointing, or nearly so (see Chapter 9), unless their mission is to scan the upper 
regions of the Earth's atmosphere, in which case their primary field of regard will 
likely be the Earth's limb. The geosynchronous types are likely nadir-pointing, or 
spin-stabilized with despun platforms or spin-scan instruments. 
Military reconnaissance satellites constitute a large percentage of Earth 
observation spacecraft. Some of these are at high altitude for wide area surveillance, 
whereas others operate at low altitude to obtain the best resolution. Among the latter 
are some of the highest-resolution spacecraft imagers yet flown. Actual 
performance is classified, but open literature discusses cases in which specific 
individual aircraft have been identified by tail number. In some cases, the spacecraft 
descend to relatively low altitudes to improve resolution. Circular orbits at such 
altitudes would not be stable; therefore, the spacecraft operate in elliptic orbits with 
very low periapsis altitudes to allow time to raise the apogee periodically, thus 
compensating for the drag that would result in a quick reentry from a circular orbit. 
This same strategy was used by NASA's Atmospheric Explorer series of satellites 
in the 1970s. Perigee altitudes below 150 km were used to allow direct sampling of 
the upper atmosphere, with the lower limit set by the allowable heating rate and the 
need to control drag sufficiently well to avoid premature reentry. 
In recent years, a number of private commercial companies have been formed 
for the purpose of offering imaging of 1-m or better resolution, the limit (for U.S. 
companies) set by the U.S. government, and comparable to the resolution of 
military reconnaissance satellites. The commercial availability of images of such 
high resolution has caused some consternation among the military of various 
nations, because other nations without space capability can now purchase 
military-quality reconnaissance data. This has led to the desire to prevent 
imaging of certain critical areas, a concept that is essentially impossible to 
enforce on a global basis, especially as spaceflight capability becomes more 
broadly available.

surface composition of the Earth. Both scientific and commercial interests are 
served by the data from these spacecraft, which generally employ sensors 
operating in a variety of spectral bands. Again, near-polar sun-synchronous orbits 
are most commonly used.

8.2.1.3 Solar observation. Solar observation is among the oldest 
disciplines in space science, going back to the sounding rocket observations 
that began just after World War II. The advantages to solar observation of I 
eliminating atmospheric filtering are obvious. For some observations it is 
desirable to get away from the Earth altogether; thus, many solar observation 
spacecraft have been in solar rather than Earth orbit. The sun emits huge amounts 
of energy in all wavelengths from infrared to x-ray, plus considerable particulate I 
radiation. Thus, the sensors for solar observation are by no means .restricted to 
optical wavelengths. Such phenomena as the decay of solar-emitted neutrons 
make it necessary to approach as close to the sun as possible if those particles are 
to be detected. To date, no spacecraft has come much closer than the orbit of 
Mercury, but several mission concepts have been studied for grazing or impact 
missions. An interesting possibility, applied to the International Sun-Earth 
Explorer (ISEE) mission and various subsequent spacecraft, is to place the 
spacecraft in a "halo" orbit about the libration point (see Chapter 4), thus locating 
the spacecraft near the line between the Earth and the sun but slightly offset from 
it. The halo orbit about the libration point allows Earth-based antennas to view 
the spacecraft without the sun, an overwhelming noise source, in the antenna field 
of view. As viewed from Earth, the spacecraft appears to circle around the sun, 
thus the name "halo orbit." 
8.2.1.4 Astronomical. With few exceptions (such as the 1970s 
International Ultraviolet Explorer and the recent Chandra x-ray telescope), 
astronomical spacecraft have operated in low Earth orbit. Observations in the 
infrared, visible, and ultraviolet are of interest. Some instruments used for broad 
sky surveys will have relatively generous pointing constraints, whereas others 
designed for detailed observation will have extremely tight constraints. The 
Hubble Space Telescope is a case in point, requiring the most difficult pointing 
accuracy (approximately 0.01 arcseconds) and stability (approximately 
arcseconds) yet flown. The reason for discussing this topic, seemingly more. 
relevant to attitude control, here is that pointing accuracy and stability constraints 
translate into alignment accuracy and control requirements on the spacecraft 
structure, which will be strong drivers on configuration, structural design, and 
material choice and, above all, cost. 
8.2.1.5 Fields and particles. Spacecraft devoted to the observation of 
magnetic fields and particulate radiation are generally less concerned with 
accurate pointing than are other types of spacecraft. In many cases, a rotating 
spacecraft is desired to allow widespread coverage of the sky. Spacecraft 
designed to conduct this type of investigation (as well as those requiring high- 
accuracy pointing) often have some difficulty meeting multiple and competing 
requirements and desires. For example, during interplanetary cruise the three-axis

accurate pointing than are other types of spacecraft. In many cases, a rotating

designed to conduct this type of investigation (as well as those requiring high-

stabilized Voyager spacecraft were occasionally comm&ded to perform a roll- 
and-tumble sequence to provide the fields and particles payload with a survey of 
the celestial sphere. 
8.2.1.6 Planetary observation. Spacecraft designed for planetary 
observation from orbit differ little from their counterparts at Earth except for 
requirements edicted by differing environments. Some planetary spacecraft will 
be on flyby rather than orbital missions. In such a case, a scan platform for narrow 
field of view instruments is highly desirable if not mandatory. This allows 
multiple scans and photomosaic generation, which would be very difficult to 
accomplish by maneuvering the entire spacecraft during the few minutes 
available in a typical encounter. Planetary landers, of course, require 
aerodynamic deceleration and/or rocket propulsion for descent and landing. 
8.2.2 Payload and lnstmment Requirements 
The requirements that may be levied on the spacecraft by the payload are 
1) location, 2) pointing accuracy, 3) temperature, 4) magnetic field, 5) radiation, 
and 6) field of view. This list primarily addresses a payload of observational 
instruments, but many of the requirements are typical of essentially any payload. 
Payload items may demand a specific location on the spacecraft to meet the 
other requirements listed. This can often be a problem when more than one 
instrument wants the same piece of spacecraft "real estate," or when the 
requirement conflicts with those of other subsystems. 
Pointing accuracy requirements can drive configuration and structural design 
far more substantially than might appear to the casual observer. For example, 
stringent requirements may dictate extreme rigidity and temperature stability to 
minimize distortion in alignment between the instrument mount and the attitude 
control reference. This can in turn dictate structural design, material choice, and 
configuration design. 
Many payload elements have delicate components with relatively tight 
temperature constraints. This will require attention but is usually not a major 
design driver. However, when a particular sensor requires very low temperature, 
as is often the case with inkired sensors, the need to provide a clear view of space 
while eliminating the sun, planetary surfaces, or illuminated or hot spacecraft 
parts from the radiator field of view can pose a major design problem. 
In some cases a magnetically scnsitive component can simply be shielded 
from spacecraft-generated magnetic fields and thus will not offer any particular 
configuration problem. However, if the component is a sensor for detecting and 
measuring planetary magnetic fields, it must be isolated from the spacecraft fields 
without compromising its function. Generally, the answer is distance, often a 
fairly large distance. This in turn usually dictates some sort of deployable 
structure.

Structure.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Many components are sensitive to radiation dosage. Although shielding is 
possible, it requires added mass, the anathema of the space systems engineer. 
Clever configuration design may be called upon to minimize exposure to I 
radiation sources such as radioisotope-based power generators (RTG) and 
heaters. 
Field of view requirements on configuration are obvious because the payload 
has to be able to see its target without interference from other parts of the 1 
spacecraft. This requirement is more easily stated than satisfied and will often tax 
the designer's ingenuity to achieve an acceptable compromise. 
Environmental drivers on configuration and structural design are fairly 
obvious: solar distance, atmosphere, radiation, thermal, vibration, and acoustic. 
The variable intensity of solar energy with distance is primarily of concern for 
thermal control and solar to electric conversion. In a discussion of spacecraft, one 
might assume that atmosphere would be of concern only for planetary landers and 
entry systems. Recall, however, that all spacecraft have to survive in the Earth's 
atmosphere first, and concerns regarding chemical attack (oxygen and water 
vapor), temperature and pressure fluctuations, wind, etc., must be considered. Of 
particular concern is the rapid pressure drop during ascent and passage through 
the pressure regime conducive to corona discharge. 
Environmental radiation is usually not a major concern in configuration and 
structural design, except that on occasion it may be necessary to accommodate 
shielding of sensitive components. In severe environments, where one might 
shield the entire spacecraft, the configuration may be driven toward a very 
compact design to maximize self-shielding and minimize the external area that 
must be shielded. It was noted in Chapter 3 that long-term radiation exposure may 
cause degradation in the properties of composite structures. 
The impact of the spacecraft's local thermal environment can range from 
minimal to substantial. For operations in deep space, the sun is essentially the 
entire thermal environment, and, unless it is very close, it is relatively easy to deal 
with. On the other hand, a spacecraft in low orbit about Mercury not only 
experiences solar intensity on the order of 10 times that of Earth, but is also 
exposed to radiation from the hot surface of the planet. The temperature of the hot 
side of Mercury (up to 700°C) is such that the re-radiation of the absorbed solar 
energy takes place in the infrared. Because spacecraft are usually designed to 
radiate in the infrared to dispose of absorbed and internally generated heat, they 
are also fairly good infrared absorbers. Thus, the surface of Mercury, radiating 
infrared at a rate nearly comparable to the sun itself, is a major source of thermal 
input. Very clever configuration and mission design is required to maintain a 
spacecraft within acceptable thermal limits in this environment. 
The design requirements for vibration and acoustics are sufficiently obvious to 
require little comment. However, the engineer should keep in mind that which

The variable intensity of solar energy with distance is primarily of concern for
thermal control and solar to electric conversion. In a discussion of spacecraft, one
might assume that atmosphere would be of concern only for planetary landers and

are also fairly good infrared absorbers. Thus, the surface of Mercury, radiating
infrared at a rate nearly comparable to the sun itself, is a major source of thermal
input. Very clever configuration and mission design is required to maintain a
spacecraft within acceptable thermal limits in this environment.

The design requirements for vibration and acoustics are sufficiently obvious to
require litthe comment. However, the engineer should keep in mind that which

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 389 
environment is the driver may be less clear. Launch or atmospheric entry may be 
the most severe; however, they are brief compared to, for example, a four-hour 
cross-country flight or a four-day truck ride. Designing for the mission without 
considering how the hardware is to be handled on the ground frequently causes 
major problems. In fact, the in-flight difficulty experienced in deploying the 
Galileo high-gain antenna was ultimately attributed to damage sustained during 
multiple cross-country trips resulting from repeated launch delays. 
8.2.4 Power Source 
Various types of power sources that may impact configuration and structure 
are 1) solar photovoltaic, 2) radioisotope thermoelectric generators, and 3) new 
technology such as reactor based, solar dynamic, and radioisotope dynamic. 
Notably absent are batteries and fuel cells, which, except for the requirement to 
accommodate a certain mass and volume, pose few constraints as a rule. The 
same cannot be said for the other types of power sources listed. Solar 
photovoltaic systems require large areas with an essentially unobstructed view of 
the sun and, at least in the case of large flat arrays, the ability to maintain the array 
surface normal to the sun. Drum-shaped, spin-stabilized craft require even larger 
areas because only a part of the area can be exposed to the sun. None of the 
preceding factors would not cause great problems except that it is also necessary 
to mount and point accurately various antennas, science instruments, attitude 
control sensors, etc. These requirements are often in conflict regarding which 
item of hardware occupies a particular area on the vehicle, and because of 
possible shadowing, field of view interference, etc. 
RTGs generally relieve some of the location problem and the demand for large 
area; however, they bring their own set of problems. Because of the need to reject 
heat from the outer surface of the RTG and because of the radiation from the 
decaying isotopes, it is usually not practical to mount them inside the spacecraft 
or even extremely close to it. In most applications, RTGs are boom mounted at 
some distance from the spacecraft to reduce the effect of both nuclear and thermal 
radiation. Launch volume constraints dictate that the mounting structure be 
deployable. Examples of this sort of installation will be seen later. 
The newer technology systems that are listed have not flown (except for one 
experimental reactor) on U.S. spacecraft. The radiation output from a nuclear 
reactor is far more energetic and damaging than that from an RTG. Also, because 
reactors emit far more power, the waste heat to be disposed of is greater. This 
latter requirement leads to very large radiator areas, with all the predictable 
problems in launch stowage, thermal input,'view of space, etc. The radiation 
requires great distances and/or massive shielding. In proposed designs using 
reactors a compromise is usually reached, placing the reactor as far from the 
spacecraft as practical and then shielding to reduce the radiation flux at the

environment is the driver may be less clear. Launch or atmospheric entry may be
the most severe; however, they are brief compared to, for example, a four-hour
cross-country flight or a four-day truck ride. Designing for the mission without
considering how the hardware is to be handled on the ground frequently causes
major problems. In fact, the in-flight difficulty experienced in deploying the
Galileo high-gain antenna was ultimately attributed to damage sustained during
multiple cross-country trips resulting from repeated launch delays.

8.2.4 Power Source

Various types of power sources that may impact configuration and structure
are 1) solar photovoltaic, 2) radioisotope thermoelectric generators, and 3) new
technology such as reactor based, solar dynamic, and radioisotope dynamic.
Notably absent are batteries and fuel cells, which, except for the requirement to
accommodate a certain mass and volume, pose few constraints as a rule. The
same cannot be said for the other types of power sources listed. Solar
photovoltaic systems require large areas with an essentially unobstructed view of
the sun and, at least in the case of large flat arrays, the ability to maintain the array
surface normal to the sun. Drum-shaped, spin-stabilized craft require even larger
areas because only a part of the area can be exposed to the sun. None of the
preceding factors would not cause great problems except that it is also necessary
to mount and point accurately various antennas, science instruments, attitude
control sensors, etc. These requirements are often in conflict regarding which
item of hardware occupies a particular area on the vehicle, and because of
possible shadowing, field of view interference, etc.

RTGs generally relieve some of the location problem and the demand for large
area; however, they bring their own set of problems. Because of the need to reject
heat from the outer surface of the RTG and because of the radiation from the
decaying isotopes, it is usually not practical to mount them inside the spacecraft
or even extremely close to it. In most applications, RTGs are boom mounted at
some distance from the spacecraft to reduce the effect of both nuclear and thermal
radiation. Launch volume constraints dictate that the mounting structure be
deployable. Examples of this sort of installation will be seen later.

The newer technology systems that are listed have not flown (except for one
experimental reactor) on U.S. spacecraft. The radiation output from a nuclear
reactor is far more energetic and damaging than that from an RTG. Also, because
reactors emit far more power, the waste heat to be disposed of is greater. This
latter requirement leads to very large radiator areas, with all the predictable
problems in launch stowage, thermal input, view of space, etc. The radiation
requires great distances and/or massive shielding. In proposed designs using
reactors a compromise is: usually reached, placing the reactor as far from the
spacecraft as practical and then shielding to reduce the radiation flux at the
spacecraft distance to an acceptable level. Because of the thickness and great
weight of the shield, “shadow shielding” is employed. That is, the shield is placed

for Earth installations. The very long boom with large masses at either end and 
possibly in the middle (as would be the case with ion propulsion units) introduces I 
some major challenges in structure and mechanism design as well as in dynamics 
and control. I 
Solar dynamic systems require the same solar field of view and pointing 
control requirements as photovoltaic arrays, possibly with somewhat tighter 1 
accuracy constraints depending on the type of collector used. Most dynamic 
conversion systems have very large waste heat radiators because the low- 
temperature end of the thermodynamic cycle must be relatively cool to achieve 
good efficiency. The radiators require a good view of space and a minimum view 
of the sun, nearby planets, etc. 
An additional problem involving any unit using dynamic energy conversion is 
the introduction into the structure of a "hum" at the frequency of the rotating 
machinery. It may be necessary to design the structure and select materials to 
damp out the vibration as much as possible to reduce the impact on attitude 
control. 
Radioisotope dynamic systems are, as one would expect, a hybrid of the 
problems of the solar dynamic system and the RTG. The radiation problem 
persists and is combined with the need for large radiator area and the potential 
vibration problems inherent in dynamic conversion. The much greater efficiency 
of these dynamic units compared to RTGs or solar photovoltaic arrays is the 
incentive to use them. However, they do introduce some challenges to the 
configuration and structure designer. 
8.2.5 Launch Vehicles 
Launch vehicle constraints exist for mass, dimension, vibration and acoustic 
energy, and safety. Of these, the first and most obvious constraint forced on the 
designer is that of launch mass capability. Next is payload dimension, not only 
the length and diameter of the payload volume available but also the dimensions 
of the attachment interfaces. The mass and volume available dictate the size of 
the basic structure, drive the selection and design of deployable structures, and, in 
many cases, strongly influence the choice of materials. 
The acoustic and vibration environment imposed by the launch vehicle is 
generally the most intense that the spacecraft will encounter, although as 
mentioned earlier, because of the relative brevity of the powered flight, the 
cumulative effect of prelaunch environments may be of equal or greater seventy. 
The measured or calculated launch environments are used to define qualification 
test criteria. These criteria are defined by drawing curves that envelop the actual 
environment. Factors are then applied to these curves to define flight qualification 
or Aight acceptance (FA) criteria. Higher factors are used to define type 
acceptance (TA) criteria. A factor of 1.5 applied to the actual environmental 
stress might be used to define FA levels, and a factor of 2.0 used to define TA.

the length and diameter of the payload volume available but also the dimensions
of the attachment interfaces. The mass and volume available dictate the size of

or flight acceptance (FA) criteria. Higher factors are used to define type
acceptance (TA) criteria. A factor of 1.5 applied to the actual environmental
stress might be used to define FA levels, and a factor of 2.0 used to define TA.

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 391 
Actual flight articles would be tested to FA levels to demonstrate workmanship 
and margin over expected values. Flight articles would be expected to withstand 
FA without damage or unacceptable response. TA levels are used to demonstrate 
qualification of the basic design, and may push the structure to near failure. 
Structural yielding or other responses may occur that would render the article 
unacceptable for flight use, and so TA levels are only applied to nonflight 
prototypes. Severe budget constraints in recent years have often resulted in 
programs where only one spacecraft is built and flown, with no prototypes or test 
articles. In such cases, compromise test levels (protoflight levels) between FA 
and TA may be defined. Chapter 3 provides representative environmental data for 
several launch vehicles. 
Launch safety constraints are generally not a major driver for structure and 
configuration design when expendable launch vehicles are used. The primary 
constraint is that the spacecraft not fail, a criterion to which everyone involved 
will subscribe. Occasionally, as when radioactive or other hazardous materials 
are carried, there will be issues revolving around a launch abort. In the event of an 
errant launch vehicle being destroyed by range safety, there may be a requirement 
that the spacecraft break up in certain ways or not break up at all upon reentry. 
This situation might obtain in the case of a spacecraft bearing RTGs or a nuclear 
reactor, for example. For the most part, the constraints will be on pad operations 
involving personnel. The most common example is imposition of minimum 
safety factors and possibly fracture mechanics criteria on pressure vessels that 
must be pressurized in the presence of personnel. 
Spacecraft destined for launch on the space shuttle come under much more 
severe scrutiny. Because the shuttle is manned and because there are few of them, 
stxict safety constraints are levied to ensure that no problem with the payload will 
cause a hazard to the shuttle or crew. With the exception of higher safety factors

The spacecraft communications system must consider antenna size, pointing 
accuracy, and radiated power. The primary impact of the spacecraft communi- 
cation system on configuration lies in antenna size and required location relative 
to the major attitude control references. Relatively small lower-gain antennas 
usually do not present a major problem, whereas a large high-gain dish, 
especially one that is required to move during the course of a mission, can require 
considerable attention. In the latter case, the antenna will generally be latched 
down during launch and deployed after placement on orbit, placing additional 
requirements on the structure design and on related mechanical deployment 
devices.

8.2.6 Communication

The spacecraft communications system must consider antenna size, pointing
accuracy, and radiated power. The primary impact of the spacecraft communi-
cation system on configuration lies in antenna size and required location relative
to the major attitude control references. Relatively small lower-gain antennas
usually do not present a major problem, whereas a large high-gain dish,

Tequirements on the structure design and on related mechanical deployment

Not only is pointing direction a concern to the configuration designer, but the 
required pointing accuracy may be as well. Pointing accuracy requirements may 
drive structural design and the choice of structural materials in an effort to I 
minimize the effect of distortion from thermal effects or structural loads. Such 
distortions, by introducing bias errors between the attitude control reference and 
the antenna mount, can cause problems in accurate pointing of very tight beams, 
and similarly for other spacecraft instruments. I 
As we have mentioned, pointing stability (the magnitude and frequency 
spectrum of the instantaneous variation about the mean pointing direction) can be 
of equal concern. In many applications familiar to the authors, relatively 
generous mean pointing accuracy constraints may apply; however, the allowed I 
variation, or jitter, about this mean position must be very tightly controlled. This 
is accomplished through passive or active vibration isolation, the use of artificial 
vibration damping in structural materials, and the enforcement of rigid vibration 
control specifications on spacecraft subsystems and instruments. 
Mission requirements for reasons other than instrument or pointing control , 
my exist. For example, many if not most materials processing experiments to be 
conducted on the International Space Station (ISS), or elsewhere, are rendered 
useless by even low average levels of vibration (e.g., g). It is often stated 
that space materials research requires a "microgravity" environment, which is 
true. However, what is usually required is in actuality the absence of forces of any 
kind, a matter often not fully appreciated. We will summarize this issue by noting 
that few aspects of space vehicle design will be more demanding than the 
requirement to maintain a very "quiet" spacecraft when necessary to satisfy 
particular mission goals. 
Finally, the radiated power of the communications system may impose certain 
requirements. In the case of very high power systems, it may be necessary to 
avoid placing components where they can be illuminated by sidelobes and 
backlobes of the antenna. Also, if a very large amount of power is being radiated 
from the antenna, then even more is being dissipated in the form of waste heat 
within-the spacecraft. The configuration design must be able to accommodate the 
conduction of this internally generated heat to the appropriate radiating surface of 
the spacecraft for rejection to space, or on some fortuitous occasions as arranged 
by a clever thermal control engineer, to a place elsewhere on the spacecraft where 
the additional heat is wanted.

launched in 1977 to explore the outer planets of the solar system. The baseline 
mission was to be a four-year trip involving a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn by each 
spacecraft. In the event, by use of planetary gravitational assists as discussed in 
Chapter 4, Voyager 2 was redirected to extend its mission to encounters of 
Uranus and Neptune. The latter encounter, in August 1989, was some 12 years 
after launch. Voyager 1, its trajectory bent out of the plane of the ecliptic by its 
encounter with Saturn, encountered no more planets but continues to send back 
data concerning regions of space not previously visited. Both spacecraft have 
considerably exceeded solar system escape velocity and will continue 
indefinitely into interstellar space. As this is written, both spacecraft are being 
tracked periodically. While there is no longer sufficient power to run the imaging 
instruments, which in any case have nothing to see, the fields and particles 
instruments still measure the local environment. It is hoped that the Voyagers will 
soon encounter the elusive interface between the solar-dominated environment 
and true interstellar space. 
The great distances from the sun at which the Voyager spacecraft are designed 
to operate dictate two of the most prominent features of the configuration. 
Because solar power is not available (e.g., it is reduced to only about 1.6 w/m2 at 
the orbit of Neptune), power is provided by RTGs. Because great distance from 
the sun also connotes great distance from Earth, a large antenna is required to 
support the data rates desired. 
However, the sun does provide a useful attitude reference. A sun sensor peers 
through an opening in the antenna dish. Because the antenna must point at the 
Earth and it is necessary to keep the sun off the axis of the antenna to prevent 
overheating of the subreflector, there is a slight offset between the antenna 
boresight and that of the sun sensor. However, this bias was designed for the 
baseline JupiterlSaturn mission and is no longer necessary at the huge distance 
from the sun at which both spacecraft now operate. A star tracker is used to 
provide the reference for the third axis. 
The RTGs are mounted on a rigid hinged boom that was latched to the final 
launch stage and then swung into final position after stage-burnout. The in-line 
arrangement is used to minimize radiation to the bus, because the inboard RTG, 
although itself a source of radiation, is also a shield for the radiation from the 
other two. 
With one exception, the science instruments are mounted on the boom radially 
opposite to the RTG boom. This has the desirable feature of placing them as far as 
possible from the RTGs. The fields and particles instruments, concerned mostly 
with the sun, solar wind, and planetary trapped radiation, are mounted on the 
boom outside the shadow of the antenna. The visual imaging, infrared, and 
ultraviolet instruments are located on a two-axis scan platform located at the end 
of the boom. These instruments are primarily concerned with the planets and 
satellites and require accurate pointing and quick retargeting capability. 
The one science instrument not located on the science boom is the 
magnetometer. This unit needs to be as far as possible from the spacecraft

deployment is 15 m (50 ft) in length but which retracts for launch into a can less 
than 1 m in length. Two magnetometers are mounted: one at the outer end of the 
boom and the other halfway out. The outer one is used for obtaining science data, 
whereas the other is primarily intended to help evaluate the residual spacecraft 
field in support of data analysis. 
With both the RTG boom and the science boom folded aft for launch, these 
items are clearly much closer together than when deployed. Both are'latched to 
the solid-propellant final stage, and the case and propellant provide considerable 
shielding. Nevertheless, a'higher radiation dose was accumulated in the few 
weeks between final assembly and launch than in months of spaceflight. 
The 10-sided bus contains the majority of engineering subsystems. The large 
spherical tank contains the hydrazine propellant for the combined attitude control 
and propulsion subsystem. This tank is located in the center of the bus not only to 
maintain the hydrazine at a satisfactory temperature but also to aid in shielding 
the instruments from the RTGs. Equally important is the fact that, as propellant is 
used, the vehicle center of mass remains essentially unchanged, greatly 
simplifying attitude control requirements.

object lesson concerning how a seemingly innocuous decision in one subsystem 
can have an unexpected detrimental effect in another area. 
Originally, the separation plane was to be at the bottom of the bus and the truss 
was to be jettisoned along with the rocket motor. However, some concern was 
expressed regarding the effect of shock generated by the explosive release nuts on 
nearby electronics. An easy solution was adopted: separatibn would occur at the 
motor, leaving the truss legs attached to the bus. The small additional weight of 
the truss would have no significant effect on the mission, and this approach would 
save much effort in shock isolation, etc. 
All was well until, a few days after the launch, the aft-facing array of thrusters 
was fired to correct the trajectory. The thrusters fired for the proper amount of time 
and appeared to have operated properly; however, the maneuver AV was low by a 
substantial percentage. The technical detective work will not be detailed here, but 
the conclusion was that the exhaust jets from the thrusters, expanding rapidly in the 
vacuum, impinged upon the nearby truss members. The effect was generation of 
drag on the truss by the supersonic flow, thus reducing the effective thrust. Spurious 
forces normal to the thrust line were also generated, perturbing the spacecraft 
attitude, corrections for which required the expenditure of yet more fuel.

development delays, early changes in specified upper stage capability, further 
delays due to the Challenger accident, cancellation of the planned shuttle-

and two such flybys of Earth were required to give the spacecraft sufficient energy

then fire its rocket engine for insertion into a highly elliptic orbit about Jupiter. 
From this orbit, the planet and most of its satellites would be closely studied, the 
latter in a series of close flybys. Each flyby would use the gravity of the satellite to 
modify Galileo's orbit for its next encounter. The mission plan was successfully

axis-stabilized spacecraft. The spinning portion would provide the global coverage 
desired by the fields and particles instruments, and the fixed portion would provide 
a stable base for the high-resolution imaging that a spinning spacecraft cannot 
provide. The spinning portion of the spacecraft would provide attitude stability

preclude simply making the spacecraft larger in diameter or longer. There are 
several possible solutions to this problem involving deployable vanes, paddles,

the vehicle. Additional solar panel area is incorporated in a cylindrical shell that 
surrounds the main bus. This provides power during cruise to orbit. Once the 
apogee motor has fired, the shell is deployed down, exposing the solar cells on 
the main bus structure. This approximately doubles the length of the spacecraft

8.3.1.8 HS-702. The HS-702 spacecraft is a large’ geostationary
communications satellite. This three-axis stabilized spacecraft was developed
when the power limitations of the HS-376 spacecraft became too constraining.
This spacecraft uses trough-like concentrators on its solar arrays to reduce the
required array size.

8.3.2 Design and Packaging Concepts

A variety of internal structural design and electronic packaging concepts have
evolved in conjunction with the configuration designs discussed previously.

features of each. These points are discussed further in the following paragraphs.

these approaches, and the names applied to the various concepts will not

8.3.2.1 Dual shearplate. This approach, most prominently used by JPL 
in the Mariner, Viking, and Voyager family of spacecraft, mounts the electronics 
on flat honeycomb plates or, in the case of components such as gyroscope 
packages, in especially tailored boxes compatible with the overall packaging 
scheme. The plates are then bolted to inner and outer shear plates as shown in Fig. 
8.8. These shear plates are inserted into the bus frame from the outside, and 
both shear plates are bolted to the bus. The shear plates provide closure to the 
bus frame, resulting in a final structure that is very rigid and sturdy. Because 
the electronics is customized for the application, the packaging density 
can be very efficient and quite high, probably the best among the concepts 
discussed. 
Because the electronics is distributed over the aluminum honeycomb sheets 
that are then tightly mounted to the shear plates, which are also heat rejection 
surfaces, thermal transfer capability is generally good, although special 
provisions may be required for high-power dissipation items. 
The negative aspects of this concept are the relatively large part count: shear 
plates, honeycomb sheets, very large fastener count, etc. This implies high 
manufacturing cost and labor-intensive operations. Furthermore, if one wishes to 
use an already existing electronics subsystem, it must be repackaged to be 
compatible with this approach. Cabling also may be more complex.

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 407 
In summary, this is an expensive approach compared to other schemes. 
However, the virtues of structural strength, rigidity, and high-density custom 
packaging may be worth the cost in some applications: 
8.3.2.2 Shelf. The arrangement referred to as shelf-type packaging could 
equally well be characterized by other descriptions. It refers to an arrangement 
wherein shelves or bulkheads mounted orthogonal to the axis of a cylindrical 
spacecraft provide support for the electronics and other internal systems. This 
arrangement is typical, for example, of the interior structure of the dual-spin 
spacecraft described earlier. 
This approach generally is less volumetrically efficient in terms of the amount 
of electronics per unit volume of spacecraft than some others. On the other hand, 
this is often not a major disadvantage, since the volume of the spacecraft is driven 
by the required solar array area and more internal volume is available than is 
required. The use of a basic flat mounting structure is more adaptable to the use of 
standard electronics in existing "black box" configuration without requiring 
customizing. 
Rejection of large amounts of internally generated heat can be a problem, 
because components mounted near the centerline are far from the walls of the 
cylinder. If heat is rejected from these walls, the conduction path may be rather 
lengthy. In the case of the HS-376, the end opposite the antennas is essentially 
open for heat rejection. This works well for items with a clear view of the open 
end but will be less satisfactory if a stack of shelves or bulkheads is used. 
8.3.2.3 Skin panellframe. This concept, of which examples are shown 
in Figs. 8.9 and 8.10, uses a basic structural frame or bus. The faces of this 
structure are closed with plates or panels that may in some cases form part of the 
load-bearing structure, as do the shear plates in the other configuration discussed 
earlier. In the examples shown, FLTSATCOM and TIROS/DMSP, the panels are 
hinged along one side to swing open for easy access. The panels provide 
mounting structure for electronic equipment, cabling, and other hardware. 
The ability to use standard, uncustomized electronics assemblies is an 
advantage of this configuration. Emplacement of the boxes directly on the plates 
that can directly reject heat to space is an advantage for thermal control. This 
approach is in general somewhat less rigid and structurally efficient than the dual 
shear plate concept. 
8.3.2.4 Factors in structural concept selection. All of the structural 
concepts discussed earlier have significant virtues as well as some undesirable 
features. Which one is chosen will depend on a variety of factors, including 
overall configuration, mission, payload, and, occasionally, organizational 
prejudice. However, there are a number of factors that should be considered in 
any basic choice and in the subsequent implementation of that choice.

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 409 
Almost axiomatically, it is desirable to minimize parts count. The larger the 
number of individual parts, particularly small ones such as fasteners, the higher 
the cost is likely to be. This is true not only of manufacturing but also of test and 
operations, which are likely to be much more labor intensive and time 
consuming. It must be noted, howe\.er, that the desire to minimize fasteners will 
be viewed with alarm by structural analysts, who tend to prefer many small 
fasteners to a few large ones in order to improve structural load transmission and 
distribution. As always, the design will be a compromise. 
With rare exceptions, there will be pressure to minimize structural mass. This 
is usually a tradeoff against cost of materials and qualification testing. A very 
sophisticated structure designed with tight margins to achieve minimum mass 
will often require expensive materials and will be expensive to design and 
fabricate because of the more detailed and sophisticated analysis required. Even 
less obvious, and therefore often a cost trap for the unwary, is the fact that such 
structures are often more expensive to test for qualification and workmanship 
certification. 
In most cases, the spacecraft structural design will be driven by a requirement 
for structural stiffness rather than strength. This is because excessive deflection 
under load, even though there is no permanent yielding, usually cannot be 
tolerated. 
The degree of understanding and the maturity of the concept are iniportant in 
minimizing development cost, as is minimization of complexity. A well- 
understood, reasonably simple structure with characteristics that can be firmly 
predicted is highly desirable to minimize both risk and cost. 
The operational aspects of the design are also important, yet are sometimes 
overlooked. Whatever the mission. it is first necessary that the spacecraft be 
integrated and tested on the ground. Ease of subsystem integration, work access, 
means of handling, and ease of disassembly and repair in the event of damage 
should all be considered. Finally, with the growing importance of on-orbit repair 
and servicing, the special needs of extravehicular activity (EVA) and 
concomitant manned flight safety constraints will be important for some 
missions, even though they may not be launched on the shuttle.

place for launch. Upon release, springs deploy the boom until it latches into the 
proper configuration. The virtues of low cost and simplicity make this boom 
attractive where there is room to stow it (stowed length is typically one-half to 
one-third deployed length) and the weight is acceptable. Many booms of this type 
have been flown. Use of stiff composite materials to keep the natural frequency as 
high as possible to minimize attitude control interactions is attractive. Close 
attention to joint design, particularly with regard to rigidity, is required for 
precise location and natural frequency control. 
The ~stromast~~ boom is an extremely sophisticated deployable structure. 
The illustration of the Voyager spacecraft in Fig. 8.1 depicts such a boom. The 
full deployed length is 15 m, but it is contained for launch in a canister about 1 m 
long. The boom consists of three fiberglass longerons stiffened at intervals by 
fiberglass intercostals and beryllium-copper cables. Stowed, the longerons are 
coiled into the canister, taking on the appearance of a coil spring. The intercostals 
and cables stack in the interior of the canister. The boom provides its own 
deployment force using the extensive amount of strain energy stored in the coiled 
longerons. The problem is to restrain the deployment to prevent damage from too 
rapid movement. This is done by a cable running up the center. The cable is 
attached to a motor through an extremely high ratio, anti-backdrive gear system 
that pays out the cable at the desired deployment rate. This motor can also be used 
to retract the boom as desired. The boom has an excellent deployed-to-stowed- 
length ratio and is very light in weight for its length. Considering the length and 
light weight, it is also fairly rigid, but typically cannot be deployed horizontally in 
a 1-g gravity field without support. As one would expect for such a sophisticated 
device, these booms are fairly expensive compared to the hinged rigid types. 
Deployment and retraction cycles may be limited because of the large amounts of 
strain experienced by the longerons when retracted. 
Stem-type booms come in several variants. In general they consist of two metal 
or composite strips formed to a particular cross section. These may be welded 
along the edges or may mechanically join via a series of teeth along the edges. In 
any case, the two strips are stowed by rolling up on areel where they are deformed 
to a flat shape and thus stow rather like tapes. As they are reeled out, the two strips 
return to their originally formed shape to provide a cross section for stiffness. The 
edges, if they are not already welded, interlock during this process. These booms 
are capable of many cycles. Beryllium-copper is a favored material to allow high 
cycle life and precise repeatability. Such a boom was used as the manipulator arm 
on the Viking Lander. Length limitations on booms of this type depend on the 
loads. They are fairly rigid even at fairly high length-to-cross-section ratios. Some 
experiments have been done by JPL and the World Space Foundation with lower 
cost variants using stainless steel shim stock. These are less precise and have 
lower cycle life, but may be satisfactory for applications.

8.3.3.3 Articulating platforms. For many missions involving high-
resolution imaging and/or where rapid retargeting of instruments is required, a

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
scan platform is desirable. Platforms of this type are usually free to move in two 
orthogonal axes, although simple single-axis platforms have been flown. These 
platforms have been used on the various Mariner, Viking Orbiter, and Voyager 
spacecraft have been highly effective in obtaining maximum coverage during 
brief flybys, and in providing detailed mosaics in areas of interest. 
The usual practice has been to move the platform using a precision stepper 
motor. Attitude reference is that of the spacecraft, and the platform motion is 
controlled relative to that reference frame. Occasionally this has required special 
effort in control of spacecraft attitude and platform pointing to achieve high- 
precision results. 
Predictably, the techniques just described have become inadequate for some 
applications. A more recent high-precision approach involves providing the scan 
platform with its own attitude references, including a gyroscope package and 
celestial sensors. This eliminates any enor that might be introduced between the 
reference frame and the platform, e.g., in the joints, angular position sensors, etc., 
in the older system. 
In essence the platform points itself relative to its own reference frame by 
reacting against the greater mass and inertia of the spacecraft. The spacecraft then 
stabilizes itself using its own attitude references. 
For many instruments, the lower precision of the spacecraft-referenced 
platform is quite satisfactory. The Mariner Mark I1 spacecraft concept, depicted 
in Fig. 8.12, has two scan platforms on diametrically opposed booms. One is a 
high-precision platform with inertial references and a star tracker, and the other is 
a conventional low-precision type. 
8.4 Mass Properties 
Spacecraft mass properties that are usually of interest to the spacecraft 
designer are vehicle mass, center of mass, moment of inertia, and moment-of- 
inertia ratio. Depending on the spacecraft type and mission, some majr be of less 
interest than others, but the first two are always important. ! 
8.4.1 Vehicle Mass 
I 
Spacecraft mass is always of substantial importance. Even if weight is not I 
particularly critical in the absolute sense, given ample launch vehicle 
performance margins, it is still important to know the payload mass accurately. 
Generally, however, mass is critical, and control must be exercised to ensure that 
acceptable values are not exceeded. This requires maintenance of a detailed list at

scan platform is desirable. Platforms of this type are usually free to move in two
orthogonal axes, although simple single-axis platforms have been flown. These
platforms have been used on the various Mariner, Viking Orbiter, and Voyager
spacecraft have been highly effective in obtaining maximum coverage during
brief flybys, and in providing detailed mosaics in areas of interest.

The usual practice has been to move the platform using a precision stepper
motor. Attitude reference is that of the spacecraft, and the platform motion is
controlled relative to that reference frame. Occasionally this has required special
effort in control of spacecraft attitude and platform pointing to achieve high-
precision results.

Predictably, the techniques just described have become inadequate for some
applications. A more recent high-precision approach involves providing the scan
platform with its own attitude references, including a gyroscope package and
celestial sensors. This eliminates any error that might be introduced between the
reference frame and the platform, e.g., in the joints, angular position sensors, etc.,
in the older system.

In essence the platform points itself relative to its own reference frame by
reacting against the greater mass and inertia of the spacecraft. The spacecraft then
stabilizes itself using its own attitude references.

For many instruments, the lower precision of the spacecraft-referenced
platform is quite satisfactory. The Mariner Mark II spacecraft concept, depicted
in Fig. 8.12, has two scan platforms on diametrically opposed booms. One is a
high-precision platform with inertial references and a star tracker, and the other is
a conventional low-precision type.

8.4 Mass Properties

Spacecraft mass properties that are usually of interest to the spacecraft
designer are vehicle mass, center of mass, moment of inertia, and moment-of-
inertia ratio. Depending on the spacecraft type and mission, some may be of less
interest than others, but the first two are always important.

8.4.1 Vehicle Mass

Spacecraft mass is always of substantial importance. Even if weight is not
particularly critical in the absolute sense, given ample launch vehicle
performance margins, it is still important to know the payload mass accurately.
Generally, however, mass is critical, and control must be exercised to ensure that
acceptable values are not exceeded. This requires maintenance of a detailed list at
least to the major component level. Table 8.2 is a typical example of such a list.

The list will change constantly all the way up to launch. Early in the program,
the list will be composed mostly of estimates and may contain some factors that
are “to be determined” (TBD) or tentative allocations. As the design matures, the

estimates will improve and the TBDs will disappear. Eventually prototype 
hardware will become available and actual values will appear in the list. As the 
hardware is refined toward actual flight units, the values will continue to change 
somewhat, but the uncertainties are much syaller. Occasionally, test results will 
mandate a hardware modification that will cause a substantial change, but such 
I 
I occurrences should be rare, and the mass list should remain fairly stable in the 
1 later phases of the program. 
Some of the reasons that an accurate knowledge of mass is required include 
I launch vehicle performance, propellant loading requirements for maneuvers, and 
, determination of the .other mass properties as needed for attitude contfol 
i algorithms. 
The significance of spacecraft mass relative to launch vehicle performance is 
obvious and is the one that usually springs to mind in discussing spacecraft mass, 
! . but other factors are important as well. 
To ensure that adequate propellant is loaded for propulsion maneuvers, 
knowledge of the spacecraft mass is essential. This is especially true when a 
solid-propellant rocket is used, because the total impulse is fixed once the 
propellant is cast and trimmed. The only control over velocity change is total 
mass, which is achieved by ballasting. This requires accurate knowledge of the 
basic mass.

mass is vital. It is essential for attitude control purposes, because, in space, all 
attitude maneuvers take place around the center of mass. Placement of thrusters, 
size of thrusters, and the lever arms upon which they act are all designed relative 
to the center of mass. When thrusters are used for translation, it is important that 
the effective thrust vector pass as nearly as possible through the center of mass to 
minimize unwanted rotational inputs and the propellant wasted in correcting such 
inputs. 
Launch vehicles frequently impose relatively tight constraints on the location 
of payload center of mass to limit the moment that may be imposed on the 
payload adapter by the various launch loads.

8.4.2. Vehicle Center of Mass

For any space vehicle, accurate knowledge of the location of the center of
mass is vital. It is essential for attitude control purposes, because, in space, all
attitude maneuvers take place around the center of mass. Placement of thrusters,
size of thrusters, and the lever arms upon which they act are all designed relative
to the center of mass. When thrusters are used for translation, it is important that
the effective thrust vector pass as nearly as possible through the center of mass to
minimize unwanted rotational inputs and the propellant wasted in correcting such
inputs,

Launch vehicles frequently impose relatively tight constraints on the location
of payload center of mass to limit the moment that may be imposed on the
payload adapter by the various launch loads.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
J 
From the preceding discussion, it is clear that the payload center of mass 
must be both well controlled and accurately known. From the beginning, the 
configuration designer works with the design to place the center of mass within an 
acceptable envelope and locates thrusters, etc., accordingly. It is often necessary 
to juggle the location of major components or entire subsystems to achieve an 
acceptable location. This will sometimes conflict with other requirements such 
as thermal control, field of view, etc., resulting in some relatively complex - 
maneuvering to achieve a mutually acceptable arrangement. 
As noted earlier, the center of mass is computed from the beginning of the 
design process using the best weights and dimensions available. As with the 
mass, the information is updated as the design matures and actual hardware 
becomes available. Actual measurement is used to verify the center-of-mass 
location of the complete assembly. This usually takes place in conjunction with 
the weighing process, with all of the same constraints and caveats regarding 
accurate configuration knowledge as discussed earlier. Often the center-of-mass 
location is measured in all three spacecraft axes. Sometimes, however, it will be 
acceptable to determine it only in the plane normal to the launch vehicle thrust 
axis (parallel to the interface plane in an expendable launch vehicle) and compute 
it in the third axis if the tolerance on accuracy is acceptable. 
8.4.3 Vehicle Moment of Inertia 
An accurate knowledge of vehicle moment of inertia is vital for design of 
attitude control effectors (e.g., thrusters, magnetic torquers, momentum wheels) 
to achieve the desired maneuver rates about the spacecraft axes. This, together 
with mission duration, expected disturbance torques, etc., is used to size the tank 
capacity in a thruster-based system. 
Moment of inertia is computed based on knowledge of component mass and 
location. Reasonable approximations usually provide satisfactory accuracy. 
Examples of this include using point masses for compact items and rings, shells, 
or plates in place of more complex structures. 
In most cases, moment of inertia is not directly measured, particularly for 
large, complex spacecraft, because experience has shown that careful 
calculations based on measured mass and location data provide satisfactory 
accuracy. Direct measurement of moment of inertia has occasionally been done 
on programs for which it was considered necessary. The calculated moment of 
inertia can be in error by as much as 20%. The decision of whether to measure it 
directly, or to depend upon analytical results, should be based upon an analysis of 
the impact of a potential error of this magnitude. 
8.4.4 Moment-of-Inertia Ratio 
For a spinning spacecraft, the moment-of-inertia ratio between the three major 
axes is usually more important than the actual values of moment of inertia. 
(However, knowledge of moment of inertia about the spin axis is certainly 
necessary in computing spin-up requirements.) The reason is that, for a spinning

For a spinning spacecraft, the moment-of-inertia ratio between the three major
axes is usually more important than the actual values of moment of inertia.
(However, knowledge of moment of inertia about the spin axis is certainly
necessary in computing spin-up requirements.) The reason is that, for a spinning

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 41 7 
body in free space, the spin is most stable about the axis of maximum moment of 
inertia (Chapter 7). A spacecraft set spinning about one of the other axes will 
eventually shift its spin axis until it is spinning about the maximum moment- 
of-inertia axis. If there are no significant energy-dissipating mechanisms (e.g., 
I flexible structures such as whip antennas or liquids) in the spacecraft, then spin 
about the lesser moment axis may be maintained for an extended period, e.g., 
, hours or maybe even a day or so in extreme cases. However, any physical object 
I will dissipate internal strain energy in the form of heat, and the presence of such

8- mechanisms will eventually cause the shift. The classic example is the Explorer 1 
satellite, a long, thin spinner with four wire whip antennas. After arelatively short 
I time on orbit, spin shifted from a bullet-like spin about the long axis to a flat or 
! propeller-like spin. This was merely an annoyance in the Explorer case, but such 
I a flat spin or the coning motion that occurs in the transition from one axis to 
I another can prove fatal to the mission in some cases. Active nutation control can 
I prevent the shift or delay its onset, but of course this increases mass and 
I complexity. Knowledge and control of moment-of-inertia ratio is therefore a 
i major factor in the design of spinning spacecraft. 
8.4.5 Mass Properties Bookkeeping 
It is common to maintain mass properties lists with a contingency allocation to 
allow for unforeseen mass growth or other uncertainties. When done, it is 
important to vary the contingency allocation to reflect the changing state of 
knowledge of the mass properties. For example, in the conceptual phase of space 
vehicle design, it will be common to assume an allocation of 20% or more of 
contingency mass. As the design matures, this allocation will be reduced, and 
may be 1-2% for components whose design is fixed and that may even have 
flight heritage. Note that it is perhaps inadvisable to assume no contingency mass 
at all, even for systems with flight heritage. Until spacecraft integration and test 
operations are complete, there remains the possibility that a deficiency will be 
found in a new application of even a well-characterized design, and that 
additional mass will be needed as part of the solution. 
8.5 Structural Loads 
8.5.1 Sources of Structural Loads 
The primary sources of structural loads that may be imposed on a spacecraft 
are 1) linear acceleration, 2) structurally transmitted vibration, 3) shock, 4) 
acoustic loads, 5) aerodynamic loads, 6) internal pressure, and 7) thermal stress. 
Although most are concerned with launch and ground handling, some affect the 
vehicle throughout its operating lifetime. 
Linear acceleration is usually a maximum at staging, often of the first stage, 
which often has a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than the upper stages. The 
exception to this would be a vehicle such as the three-stage Delta, where the solid

body in free space, the spin is most stable about the axis of maximum moment of
inertia (Chapter 7). A spacecraft set spinning about one of the other axes will
eventually shift its spin axis until it is spinning about the maximum moment-
of-inertia axis. If there are no significant energy-dissipating mechanisms (e.g.,
flexible structures such as whip antennas or liquids) in the spacecraft, then spin
about the lesser moment axis may be maintained for an extended period, e.g.,
hours or maybe even a day or so in extreme cases. However, any physical object
will dissipate internal strain energy in the form of heat, and the presence of such

satellite, a long, thin spinner with four wire whip antennas. After a relatively short
time on orbit, spin shifted from a bullet-like spin about the long axis to a flat or
propeller-like spin. This was merely an annoyance in the Explorer case, but such
a flat spin or the coning motion that occurs in the transition from one axis to
another can prove fatal to the mission in some cases. Active nutation control can
prevent the shift or delay its onsct, but of course this increases mass and
complexity. Knowledge and control of moment-of-inertia ratio is therefore a
major factor in the design of spinning spacecraft.

8.4.5 Mass Properties Bookkeeping

It is common to maintain mass properties lists with a contingency allocation to
allow for unforeseen mass growth or other uncertainties. When done, it is
important to vary the contingency allocation to reflect the changing state of
knowledge of the mass properties. For example, in the conceptual phase of space
vehicle design, it will be common to assume an allocation of 20% or more of
contingency mass. As the design matures, this allocation will be reduced, and
may be 1—2% for components whose design is fixed and that may even have
flight heritage. Note that it is perhaps inadvisable to assume no contingency mass
at all, even for systems with flight heritage. Until spacecraft integration and test
operations are complete, there remains the possibility that a deficiency will be
found in a new application of even a well-characterized design, and that
additional mass will be needed as part of the solution.

8.5 Structural Loads

8.5.1 Sources of Structural Loads

The primary sources of structural loads that may be imposed on a spacecraft
are 1) linear acceleration, 2) structurally transmitted vibration, 3) shock, 4)
acoustic loads, 5) aerodynamic loads, 6) internal pressure, and 7) thermal stress.
Although most are concermed with launch and ground handling, some affect the
vehicle throughout its operating lifetime.

Linear acceleration is usually a maximum at staging, often of the first stage,
which often has a higher thrust-to-weight ratio than the upper stages. The
exception to this would be a vehicle such as the three-stage Delta, where the solid

41 8 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
J 
third stage as it approaches the end of burn probably causes the highest 
acceleration. 
Even though it is the factor most associated with space launch in the eyes of 
the layman, linear acceleration is often not the most significant design driver. 
This is especially true for an all-liquid-propellant launch vehicle where acoustic 
and vibration loads may well overshadow linear acceleration as design factors. In 
the case of a vehicle that reenters the atmosphere in a purely ballistic mode, the 
loads imposed during entry may well exceed those for launch. Lifting entry 
substantially reduces such loads. 
Structurally transmitted vibration is one of the major design drivers. Main 
propulsion is usually the primary source of such vibration during the launch 
phase, although aerodynamic and other forces may also contribute and may 
dominate in particular cases. For example, "hammerhead" payload fairings are 
notorious for the inducement of aerodynamic buffeting loads induced at the point 
where the more bulbous front end "necks down" to the vehicle upper stage 
diameter. The space shuttle, which was designed to minimize longitudinal loads, 
is especially bad in terms of structurally transmitted vibration because the 
payload is mounted immediately above the engines and without the isolation 
afforded by a long, flexible tank assembly in between. 
In addition to flight loads, however, the more prosaic ground handling and 
transportation loads may be significant as well. Although typically less intense, 
these inputs will be of longer duration. The several hours or days of vibration 
experienced on a truck as compared with that encountered during 8-10 minutes 
of launch may well be the dominant factor. 
Shock loads in flight are usually associated with such functions as firing of 
pyrotechnic devices, release of other types of latches, or engagement of latches. 
Ground handling again can be a contributor, because such activities as setting the 
spacecraft on a hard rigid surface even at relatively low speeds can cause a 
significant shock load. Ground-handling problems can be minimized by proper 
procedures and equipment design. In-flight shocks may require isolation or 
relocation of devices farther from sensitive components. 
Acoustic loads are most severe at liftoff because of reflection of rocket engine 
noise from the ground. They may also be fairly high in the vicinity of maximum 
dynamic pressure because of aerodynamically generated noise. This is especially 
true of the space shuttle with its large, flexible payload bay doors and the 
proximity of the payload to the engines. Acoustic loads are especially damaging 
to structures fabricated with large areas of thin-gauge material such as solar 
panels. 
Aerodynamic load inputs to the payload come about as a result of their effect 
on the launch vehicle, because the payload is enclosed during passage through the 
atmosphere. Passage through wind shear layers or aerodynamic loads due to 
vehicle angle of attack caused by maneuvering can cause abrupt changes in 
acceleration. They may also cause deflection of the airframe of the vehicle. Since, 
in general, payloads of expendable launchers are cantilevered off the forward end

in general, payloads of expendable launchers are cantilevered off the forward end

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN I 41 9 
! of the vehicle, airframe deflection has little impact on the payload except in 
extreme cases. In the case of the space shuttle, long payloads are attached at 
points along the length of the cargo bay. Deflection of the airframe can therefore 
induce loads into the payload structure. Some load alleviation provision is built 
into the attach points, and in many cases it is possible to design a statically 
determinant attachment that at least makes the problem reasonably easy to 
analyze. Very large or complex payloads may require attachment at a number of 
points, leading to a complex analytical problem. In some cases airborne support 
equipment (ASE) is designed to interface with the shuttle and take the loads from 
the airframe and protect the payload. This can be costly in payload capability, 
because all such ASE is charged against shuttle cargo capacity. 
Internal pressure is a major source of structural loads, particularly in tanks, 
plumbing, and rocket engines. It may also be a source of loads during ascent in 
inadequately vented areas. Early honeycomb structures, especially nose fairings, 
sometimes encountered damage or failure because pressure was retained inside 
the honeycomb cavities while the external pressure decreased with altitude. 
Weakening of the adhesive, caused by aerodynamic heating, allowed internal 
pressure to separate the face sheets. Careful attention to venting of enclosed 
volumes is important in preventing problems of this type. 
Internal pressure or the lack of it can also be a problem during handling and 
transportation. Some operations may result in reduced pressure in various 
volumes that must then resist the external atmospheric pressure. A common but 
by no means unique example is in the air transport of launch vehicle stages, 
especially in unpressurized cargo aircraft. If the internal tank pressure is reduced 
during high-altitude flight, either deliberately or because of a support equipment 
malfunction, then during descent the pressure differential across the tank walls 
can be negative, resulting in the collapse of the tank. Prevention of this simply 
requires attention and care, but the concern cannot be ignored. 
Thermal stress usually results from differential expansion or contraction of 
structures subjected to heating or cooling. It may also arise as a result of 
differential heating or cooling. The former effect can be mitigated to some degree 
by selection of materials with compatible coefficients of thermal expansion. 
Once the vehicle is in space, the primary sources of heat are the sun and any 
internally generated heat. The latter is usually the smaller effect, but cannot 
be ignored, especially in design of electronic components, circuit boards, etc. 
Differential heating caused by the sun on one side and the heat sink of dark space 
on the other can result in substantial structural loads. These are most easily dealt 
with by thermal insulation or by simply designing the structure to withstand the 
stress. Note that in a rotating spacecraft the inputs are cyclic, possibly at a fairly 
high rate. In massive structures the thermal inertia of the system tends to stabilize 
the temperature. However, if the material being dealt with is thin, substantial 
cyclic stress can be generated, possibly leading to eventual failure.

of the vehicle, airframe deflection has little impact on the payload except in
extreme cases. In the case of the space shuttle, long payloads are attached at
points along the length of the cargo bay. Deflection of the airframe can therefore
induce loads into the payload structure. Some load alleviation provision is built
into the attach points, and in many cases it is possible to design a statically
determinant attachment that at least makes the problem reasonably easy to
analyze. Very large or complex payloads may require attachment at a number of
points, leading to a complex analytical problem. In some cases airborne support
equipment (ASE) is designed to interface with the shuttle and take the loads from
the airframe and protect the payload. This can be costly in payload capability,

increases. This can cause not only substantial structural loads, but also sufficient 
deformation that accurate pointing of sensors may be difficult. I 
Thermal inputs to long booms of various types can easily cause substantial 
deflection, often of a cyclic nature. This in turn can couple with the structural 
design, possibly depending on local shadow patterns, to cause cyclic motion of 
the boom, and can cause instability in spacecraft pointing or at least increase the I 
requirements on the attitude control system. 
The presence of cryogenic materials onboard the spacecraft for propulsion or

complicated by the need for thermal isolation of the cryogenic system from the

well established and understood, computer software such as NASTRAN. Modern 
computer aided design (CAD) packages, such as IDEA-sTM, AU~OCAD~~, 
~ro~n~ineer-, and numerous others, include this and many other features, 
offering outstanding interactive design capability to the structural engineer. 
For preliminary purposes, however, inputs can usually be approximated using 
factors and formulas empirically derived from previous launches. Structural 
elements may then be sized in a preliminary manner using standard statics 
techniques.2s3 The resulting preliminary size and mass estimates and material 
choices may then be refined with more sophisticated techniques. 
It should be borne in mind that, although the sources of structural loads were 
discussed separately, they generally act in combination and must be used that 
way for design purposes. As an example, a cryogenic tank, pressurized during 
launch, will be subjected to thermally induced loads, internal pressure loads, and 
the vibration, linear acceleration, and acoustic loads of launch. Similarly, a 
deployable structure may encounter release and latching shocks while still under 
differential thermal Stress resulting from exiting the Earth's shadow. Design load 
assessment must incorporate reasonable assumptions regarding such composite 
loads, based on the requirements of the actual flight profile. 
8.5.3 Load Allevlation 
Various means are used to alleviate structural loads. For example, the shuttle 
main engines are throttled back to approximately 65% of rated thrust during 
passage through the period of maximum dynamic pressure in ascent flight. 
Although this is done out of concern for the structural integrity of the orbiter, it 
can be beneficial to the payload as well. Most expendable vehicles lack this 
capability, although solid motor thrust profiles and angle-of-attack control may 
be practiced to moderate aerodynamic loads during this critical period.

422 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
It is necessary to ensure that the spacecraft has no resonant modes at or near any 
of those for the launch vehicle, or near any peaks of the random vibration 
spectrum. Usually there will be a basic specification that the first spacecraft mode 
must be higher than some threshold frequency, with other more specific concerns 
as noted. As mentioned earlier, preliminary analysis will be carried out assuming 
the launch vehicle and spacecraft are separate entities; later, it will be necessary 
to combine the rocket and space vehicle models and assess them as a single, fully 
coupled structure. 
For launch vehicles themselves, and for some spacecraft, it will be required to 
verify that vehicle resonant modes do not closely couple to "slosh  mode^,"^ 
which exist when propellant tanks are partially full. Launch vehicles tanks 
contain slosh baffles5 and other design features to control these modes of 
oscillation, and spacecraft sometimes use "bladder" tanks to prevent it, but in all 
cases the issue must be addressed by the design. 
Spacecraft structural modes are, as discussed in Chapter 7, also relevant to the 
attitude control system design. It is necessary either to keep the spacecraft 
primary mode well above the control system passband, or to include any 
offending modes as part of the 'plant" to be controlled. This latter feature 
naturally complicates the design, but often cannot be avoided. Even then, failure 
to model the structure with sufficient accuracy can lead to difficulty, and, as 
Murphy's Law would have it, higher order modes are generally less accurately 
known than those of lower order. Often the worst problems are those associated 
with uncertainty in the structural damping ratio (see Chapter 7) to be assumed. 
Spacecraft structures are often quite lightly damped (e.g., l< 0.01), and 
significant uncertainty in the actual value can lead to gross errors in estimating 
the settling time following maneuvers or other disturbances. A classic case in this 
regard is that of the original solar arrays on the Hubble Space ~elesco~e;~

purposes, modeled as a collection of discrete mass elements representing the 
various solar arrays, connecting booms, tanks, instruments, star trackers, primary 
structure, etc., which make up the complete vehicle. Each of these elements is 
assumed to be connected to its neighbors through a spring-and-dashpot 
arrangement that describes the stiffness of, and damping associated with, the 
individual connection. The result is a highly-coupled mass-spring-dashpot 
arrangement for which the motion of the elements is described by a coupled set of 
second-order ordinary differential equations,

part, its greatest application is to the design of pressure vessels. The most 
important characteristic of a pressure vessel, especially for man-rated 
applications, is the so-called leak before burst criterion. In other words, if a 
crack forms, it is desirable that it propagate through the tank wall before it 
reaches the critical crack length, which will result in the crack propagating 
around the tank. The leak thus provides warning and possibly pressure relief 
before catastrophic failure occurs. 
Fracture mechanics analysis is used to compute the probability of failure and, 
if appropriate, leak before burst criteria based on numerous factors including the 
material, vessel size, wall thickness, pressure, contained fluid, environment, 
vessel history (particularly pressure cycles and exposure to various substances), 
and extensive empirical data on crack propagation under similar circumstances.

probability of failure and of leak before failure. Use of this technique is especially 
important for shuttle payloads. In most cases, program requirements for fracture 
mechanics analysis will be derived from, or essentially identical to, NASA 
standards in this area.13 
8.5.6 Stress Levels and Safety Factors 
In a great many cases, material choice and thickness of spacecraft structures 
will be driven by factors other than strength. The primary factors typically will be 
stiffness, i.e., minimizing deflection under load, and the minimum gauge of 
material that is available or that will allow it to be handled safely. In some cases, 
however, pressure vessels and some major structures being classic examples, the 
actual strength of the material to resist yielding or breakage is important. At this 
point safety factors become crucial. 
Typical factors of safety will often be in thk range of 1.2- 1.5 for yield. That is, 
the structure is designed to yield only when subjected to loads 1.2- 1.5 times the 
maximum expected to be encountered in service. Yield is defined in this case as 
undergoing a deformation in shape from which the structure does not recover 
when the load is removed. For all except very brittle materials, actual failure, i-e., 
structural breakage, takes place at stresses somewhat higher than yield. The ratio 
of yield stress to failure stress varies from one material to another, but typically if 
the factor of safety on yield is 1.5, the factor of safety to failure will be about 2.0. 
For some applications in manned spacecraft or man-rated systems, the factors of 
safety may be higher, especially for items critical to flight safety. 
For noncritical components the safety factors may be lower than those 
discussed earlier. In the case of a component that is not safety related or critical to 
mission success, lower factors may be acceptable. In some cases a factor of 1.0 
on yield might even be accepted, meaning that a small, permanent deformation is 
acceptable as long as the part does not break. 
An important factor to be considered is the nature and duration of the load, 
particularly whether it is steady or cyclic. The factors previously discussed 
assume steady loads or very few cycles. If the load is cyclic, then the fatigue 
characteristic of the material is the major consideration. If many cycles are 
expected, then it is important to keep the stress in the material at a level that 
allows an acceptable fatigue life. Typically this will result in a structure 
substantially overdesigned compared to one which is required to withstand a 
static load of the same magnitude. 
If the load is steady but will be applied for extremely long periods, the "creep" 
characteristics of the material may become important. An example might be a 
bolted joint, which is expected to maintain the same tension for years. However, 
the bolts might lose tension over long periods because of creep if subjected to a 
high level of stress, resulting in an inadequate creep life, even though there is no 
immediate danger of failure due to overload.

All of this information allows computation, to some level of confidence, of
probability of failure and of leak before failure. Use of this technique is especially
important for shuttle payloads. In most cases, program requirements for fracture

8.5.6 Stress Levels and Safety Factors

In a great many cases, material choice and thickness of spacecraft structures
will be driven by factors other than strength. The primary factors typically will be
stiffness, i.c., minimizing deflection under load, and the minimum gauge of
material that is available or that will allow it to be handled safely. In some cases,
however, pressure vessels and some major structures being classic examples, the
actual strength of the material to resist yielding or breakage is important. At this
point safety factors become crucial. ;

Typical factors of safety will often be in the range of 1.2-1.5 for yield. That is,
the structure is designed to yield only when subjected to loads 1.2—1.5 times the
maximum expected to be encountered in service. Yield is defined in this case as
undergoing a deformation in shape from which the structure does not recover
when the load is removed. For all except very brittle materials, actual failure, i.e.,
structural breakage, takes place at stresses somewhat higher than yield. The ratio
of yield stress to failure stress varies from one material to another, but typically if
the factor of safety on yield is 1.5, the factor of safety to failure will be about 2.0.
For some applications in manned spacecraft or man-rated systems, the factors of
safety may be higher, especially for items critical to flight safety.

For noncritical components the safety factors may be lower than those
discussed earlier. In the case of a component that is not safety related or critical to
mission success, lower factors may be acceptable. In some cases a factor of 1.0
on yield might even be accepted, meaning that a small, permanent deformation is
acceptable as long as the part does not break.

An important factor to be considered is the nature and duration of the load,
particularly whether it is steady or cyclic. The factors previously discussed
assume steady loads or very few cycles. If the load is cyclic, then the fatigue
characteristic of the material is the major consideration. If many cycles are
expected, then it is important to keep the stress in the materia] at a level that
allows an acceptable fatigue life. Typically this will result in a structure
substantially overdesigned compared to one which is required to withstand a
static load of the same magnitude.

If the load is steady but will be applied for extremely long periods, the “creep”
characteristics of the material may become important. An example might be a

the bolts might lose tension over long periods because of creep if subjected to a

Fig. 8.14 Uncertainty distributions of loads and strength. 
In considering safety factors, a frequently overlooked point is that all of the 
data, both loads and the material characteristics, have some associated 
uncertainty. This may be of secondary importance when designing ground 
equipment with safety factors of 5 or 10. It can be very critical, as we shall see, 
when designing for the small safety factors typical of aerospace hardware. This is 
most easily demonstrated by an example, depicted in Fig. 8.14. 
In this example, we assume that we have a structural material with a quoted 
yield strength of 35,000 psi, such as might be typical of an aluminum alloy. Let us 
assume a load stress of 21,000 psi. If we simply apply a safety factor of 1.5, the 
allowable stress in the structure in question would then be 23,333 psi, and we 
would expect no problems with the 21,000 psi load. However, it is known that 
there exists a significant spread in the strength data available, the standard 
deviation being 1850 psi. Thus, to minimize the probability of failure, the 3a low 
strength should be used. This amounts to 35,000-3(1850) = 29,450 psi. 
Some may be inclined to consider that "duminum is aluminum" and use the

variations due to handling, processing, or environmental history that can be 
significant. In the case of many composite materials, the effect of the 
environment and the fabrication process is even more pronounced, and 
considerable attention must be paid to possible variations in characteristics. As a 
result of this, a composite structure is often designed with significantly higher 
factors of safety than metallic structures. This prevents achieving the full 
theoretical advantages attributed to composites.

Fig. 8.14 Uncertainty distributions of loads and strength.

In considering safety factors, a frequently overlooked point is that all of the
data, both loads and the material characteristics, have some associated
uncertainty. This may be of secondary importance when designing ground
equipment with safety factors of 5 or 10. It can be very critical, as we shall see,
when designing for the small safety factors typical of aerospace hardware. This is
most easily demonstrated by an example, depicted in Fig. 8.14.

In this example, we assume that we have a structural material with a quoted
yield strength of 35,000 psi, such as might be typical of an aluminum alloy. Let us
assume a load stress of 21,000 psi. If we simply apply a safety factor of 1.5, the
allowable stress in the structure in question would then be 23,333 psi, and we
would expect no problems with the 21,000 psi load. However, it is known that
there exists a significant spread in the strength data available, the standard
deviation being 1850 psi. Thus, to minimize the probability of failure, the 3a low
strength should be used. This amounts to 35,000—3(1850) = 29,450 psi.

Some may be inclined to consider that “aluminum is aluminum” and use the
handbook value;!* however, there can be lot-to-lot variation or within-lot
variations due to handling, processing, or environmental history that can be
significant. In the case of many composite materials, the effect of the
environment and the fabrication process is even more pronounced, and
considerable attention must be paid to possible variations in characteristics. As a
result of this, a composite structure is often designed with significantly higher
factors of safety than metallic structures. This prevents achieving the full
theoretical advantages attributed to composites.

Continuing with our example, we note that due to a variety of factors there is a
deviation about the average load. We have an average value of 21,000 psi.
Comparing that to the average strength yields an apparent factor of safety of
35,000/21,000 = 1.67. Because our target factor of safety is 1.5, we might

naively be tempted to reduce the cross section, bfinging the strength of the part 
down to 31,500 psi, and saving weight. This would be a dangerous error, because 
the standard deviation of the load value in this case is 2750 psi. A combination of 
the 3a high load (29,250 psi) and the 3a low strength (29,450 psi) essentially 
uses up the entire design safety factor; the original part will survive, but just 
barely. However, the "thinned down" part would have a 3a low yield stress of 
only 25,950 psi, and would fail. I 
To be certain of a 1.5 safety factor in the worst-case combination of 3a high 
load and 30 low strength, the original value of a 1.67 safety factor based on the 
average must be maintained. 
It can be seen from the preceding discussion that a relatively small increase in 
safety factor can have a substantial impact on probability of failure. Less apparent 
but equally true is the fact that increased safety factor can allow substantial cost 
saving. With a larger safety factor it may be possible to reduce the amount of 
testing and detailed analysis required with a resulting reduction in costs. Thus, 
availability of substantial mass margins can translate into a much lower cost I 
program if program management is clever enough to take advantage of the 
opportunity thus offered. This requires management to avoid the pitfall of 
proceeding with a sophisticated test and analysis effort simply because "that's 
the way we have always done it." The JPL/Ball Aerospace Solar Mesosphere I 
Explorer (SME) is a textbook example of a program that took advantage of ample 
mass margin to keep spacecraft costs low.

down to 31,500 psi, and saving weight. This would be a dangerous error, because

not well understood. The point is that a simple statement of a value as "safety 
factor" is mianingless without understanding the basis from which it is derived. 
Furthermore, safety factor and failure rate trade with mass and cost and should be 
considered in that light. 
8.6 Large Structures 
As space activities increase in variety and complexity, it is to be expected that 
there will be increased interest in very large structures. In fact, proposals have 
already been made for solar arrays and microwave antennas on a scale of 
kilometers to beam power from geostationary orbit to Earth. The popular view, 
encouraged by those of entrepreneurial bent, is that, in a weightless environment, I 
structures can be arbitrarily large and light in mass. Although there is an element 
of truth in this, there are major practical limitations with which the designer of 
such structures must deal. 
Most large structures such as solar arrays, antennas, telescopes, etc., must 
maintain shape to a fairly tight tolerance if they are to function effectively. This is 
often difficult with the small structures that are currently in use and becomes far 
more so on a scale of tens of meters or kilometers. Thermal distortion for a given 
temperature differential is a direct function of the dimensions of the structure. 
Bigger structures distort more in an absolute sense. In most applications, attitude 
control maneuvers are required. A very lightweight flexible structure will distort 
during maneuvers and in response to attitude hold control inputs because of the 
inertia of the structure. As the force is removed, the structure springs back, but 
the low-mass, low-restoring force and (probably) near-zero damping tend to give 
rise to low-frequency oscillations that die out very slowly and, in fact, may excite 
control system instability. 
Obviously, the control force distortion concern can be partially alleviated by 
using relatively small forces and maneuvering very slowly. However, operational 
needs will dictate some minimum maneuver rate and settling time, and the system 
must be able to deal with anticipated disturbances. These requirements will set a 
lower limit to the control forces required. 
Even the assumption of weightlessness is not entirely valid for very large 
structures. In such large structures, the forces caused by the radial gradient in the 
gravity field can cause distortion, at least in lower-altitude orbits.

428 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Unfortunately, the accuracy requirements do not change as the size of the 
structure increases. A microwave antenna still requires surface accuracy on the I order of a wavelength, whether it is 1 m or 1 km in diameter. Although solar 
arrays need not maintain the same degree of surface control as an antenna, it is 
still important to maintain shape with reasonable accuracy. In any case, excessive 
structural distortion makes accurate pointing almost impossible. 
For very large space structures, it is simply not practical to maintain shape by I 
designing strength and stiffness into the structure. The mass of such a structure 
would be enormous, increasing transportation costs to an intolerable level. The 
greater complexity of assembling a more massive structure is also a matter of 
concern. In any case, it is not at all clear that a brute force approach could solve I 
the problem. New materials, particularly composites that offer the possibility of 
tailoring characteristics such as stiffness and thermal response, can contribute 
greatly but do not offer a total solution. 
The concerns just listed clearly indicate that large space structures are by no 
means as simple as their proponents, enamored by the tremendous promise I 
offered by such structures, have indicated. Worthwhile large structures must be 
relatively easy to deploy and assemble and must have predictable, repeatable, 
controllable characteristics. To properly design control systems, it is necessary to 
be able to model the response with satisfactory fidelity. This capability is now I 
becoming available through the use of modem, high-capacity computers. 
One way to deal with the problem is active shape control. This concept has 
been successfully utilized for large, Earth-based optical telescopes. The shape of 
the surface determined using laser range finders or by measuring the energy 
distribution in the beam leaving an antenna is used as input to an active control 
system that mechanically or thermally distorts the surface to compensate for 
structural irregularities. In the case of a phased array antenna, the phasing can be 
altered to accomplish the same end. Note that this is a potential solution to the 
surface control problem. The operation of the structure as a spacecraft, i.e., 
attitude control and gross pointing, remains and demands adequate modeling and 
solution to the control input, response, settling time, and flexibility problems. 
The control of large, flexible structures is a complex issue involving 
optimization among material characteristic choices, structural design approach, 
and control system design. Adding to the complexity is the probable requirement 
to launch in many separate pieces that are themselves folded into a compact 
shape. Each piece must be deployed, checked out, and joined to its mating pieces 
in as straightforward and automatic a fashion as possible to create the structure 
that the system was designed to control.

8.7 Materials
8.7.1 Structural Materials

Most materials used in space applications to date have been the conventional
aerospace structural materials. Properties of some representative materials may

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 429 
be found in Appendix B. These will continue to dominate for the foreseeable 
future, although steady growth in the use of newer materials is to be expected. 
I Among the conventional structural materials, aluminum is by far the most 
common. A large variety of alloys exist, providing a broad range of such 
characteristics as strength and weldability. Thus, for applications at moderate 
temperature in which moderate strength and good strength-to-weight ratio are 
1 desirable, aluminum is still most often the material of choice. This popularity is 
enhanced by ready availability and ease of fabrication. A number of surface- 
coating processes exist to allow tailoring of surface characteristics for hardness, 
emissivity, absorbtivity, etc. 
Magnesium is often used for applications in which higher stiffness is desired 
than can be provided by aluminum. It is somewhat more difficult to fabricate and, 
being more chemically active than aluminum, requires a surface coating for any 
extensive exposure to the atmosphere. Several coatings exist. Environmental 
constraints in recent years have limited the availability of certain desirable 
magnesium alloys containing zirconium. 
Steel, in particular stainless steel, is often used in applications requiring higher 
strength and/or higher temperature resistance. A variety of steels may be used, 
but stainless steel is often preferred because its use eliminates concern about rust 
and corrosion during the fabrication and test phase. Additionally, if the part may 
be exposed to low temperature, the low ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) 
temperature of stainless steel and similar alloys is an important factor. 
Titanium is a lightweight, high-strength structural material with excellent 
high-temperature capability. It also exhibits good stiffness. Some alloys are fairly 
brittle, which tends to limit their application, but a number of alloys with 
reasonable ductility exist. Use of titanium is limited mostly by higher cost, lower 
availability, and fabrication complexity to applications that particularly benefit 
from its special capabilities. Pressure vessels of various types and external skin of 
high-speed vehicles are typical applications. 
Beryllium offers the highest stiffness of any naturally occurring material along 
with low density, high strength, and high temperature tolerance. Thermal 
conductivity is also good. Beryllium has been used in limited applications where 
its desirable characteristics have been required. The main limitation on more 
extensive use of this apparently excellent material is toxicity. In bulk form, 
beryllium metal is quite benign and can be handled freely. The dust of beryllium 
or its oxide, however, has very detrimental effects on the human respiratory tract. 
This means that machining or grinding operations are subject to extensive safety 
measures to capture and contain dust and chips. This renders normal fabrication 
methods unusable without resorting to these intensive (i.e., expensive) measures. 
Glass fiber-reinforced plastic, generically referred to as fiberglass, was the first 
composite material used for space structure and is probably still the most 
common. The matrix material may be epoxy, phenolic, or other material, and the 
glass can range from a relatively low-quality fiber all the way to highly processed 
quartz fiber. Fiberglass is desirable because of the relative ease with which 
CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 429

be found in Appendix B. These will continue to dominate for the foreseeable
future, although steady growth in the use of newer materials is to be expected.

Among the conventional structural materials, aluminum is by far the most

desirable, aluminum is still most often the material of choice. This popularity is

being more chemically active than aluminum, requires a surface coating for any
extensive exposure to the atmosphere. Several coatings exist. Environmental
constraints in recent years have limited the availability of certain desirable
magnesium alloys containing zirconium.

Steel, in particular stainless steel, is often used in applications requiring higher
strength and/or higher temperature resistance. A variety of steels may be used,.
but stainless steel is often preferred because its use eliminates concern about rust
and corrosion during the fabrication and test phase. Additionally, if the part may
be exposed to low temperature, the low ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT)
temperature of stainless steel and similar alloys is an important factor.

Titanium is a lightweight, high-strength structural material with excellent
high-temperature capability. It also exhibits good stiffness. Some alloys are fairly
brittle, which tends to limit their application, but a number of alloys with
reasonable ductility exist. Use of titanium is limited mostly by higher cost, lower
availability, and fabrication complexity to applications that particularly benefit
from its special capabilities. Pressure vessels of various types and external skin of
high-speed vehicles are typical applications.

Beryllium offers the highest stiffness of any naturally occurring material along
with low density, high strength, and high temperature tolerance. Thermal
conductivity is also good. Beryllium has been used in limited applications where
its desirable characteristics have been required. The main limitation on more
extensive use of this apparently excellent material is toxicity. In bulk form,
beryllium metal is quite benign and can be handled freely. The dust of beryllium
or its oxide, however, has very detrimental effects on the human respiratory tract.
This means that machining or grinding operations are subject to extensive safety
measures to capture and contain dust and chips. This renders normal fabrication
methods unusable without resorting to these intensive (i.e., expensive) measures.

Glass fiber-reinforced plastic, generically referred to as fiberglass, was the first
composite material used for space structure and is probably still the most
common. The matrix material may be epoxy, phenolic, or other material, and the
glass can range from a relatively low-quality fiber all the way to highly processed
quartz fiber. Fiberglass is desirable because of the relative ease with which

430 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
complex shapes can be fabricated. It also exhibits good strength and offers the 
ability to tailor strength and stiffness both in absolute value and direction in the 
material by choice of fiber density and orientation. 
Graphite-epoxy is in very common use and may even have supplanted 
fiberglass in frequency of use. The use of high strength and stiffness graphite fiber 
in a matrix of epoxy or other polymer makes an excellent high-strength structural 
material. Proper selection of the cloth and/or unidirectional fibers offers the 
ability to tailor strength and stiffness directly and to the desired levels to optimize 
it for the purpose. The low density of graphite offers a weight advantage as well. 
High temperature characteristics are improved by use of graphite instead of glass, 
although the matrix is the final limiting factor. An increasing number of high- I temperature polymers are available for higher temperature structures. 
In addition to graphite, ~evlar~ and other high-strength fibers are increasingly 
used. 
The inconel family of alloys and other similar alloys based on nickel, cobalt, 
etc., are used for high-temperature applications. Typical application is as a heat I 
shield in the vicinity of a rocket nozzle to protect the lower temperature 
components from thermal radiation or hot gas recirculation. These alloys are of 
relatively high density, equal to that of steel or greater so, weight can be a 
problem. However, inconel in particular lends itself to processing into quite thin I 
foils, which allows its use as a shield, often in multiple layers, with minimum 
mass penalty. 
New materials coming into use are mostly composites of various types, 
although some new alloys have also appeared. Among the alloys, alurninum- 
lithium is of considerable interest, because the addition of the lithium results in 
alloys of somewhat higher strength than the familiar aluminum alloys, but 
having equal or lower density. pis material is already seeing extensive use in 
commercial aviation and in the most recent version of the space shuttle 
external tank. 
High-temperature refractory metals have been available for many years but 
have seen limited use because of high density, lack of ductility, cost, and other 
factors. Tungsten, tantalum, and molybdenum fall into this category. These 
materials are actually somewhat less available than they were some years ago. A 
great many suppliers have dropped out of the field. This may in part be related to 
the collapse of the commercial nuclear power industry in the United States. One 
exception is niobium (formerly called columbium). This material is useful to 
temperatures as high as 1300 K but has a density only slightly higher than steel. It 
is available in commercial quantities. Like all the refractory metals, it oxidizes 
rapidly if heated in air, but a silicide coating offers substantial protection in this 
environment. 
Metal matrix composites involve use of a metal matrix, e.g., aluminum, 
stiffened and strengthened by fibers of another metal or nonmetallic material. In 
aluminum, for example, fibers of boron, silicon carbide, and graphite have been 
used. Some difficulties have been encountered, such as the tendency of the molten 
430 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

complex shapes can be fabricated. It also exhibits good strength and offers the
ability to tailor strength and stiffness both in absolute value and direction in the
material by choice of fiber density and orientation.

Graphite-epoxy is in very common use and may even have supplanted
fiberglass in frequency of use. The use of high strength and stiffness graphite fiber
in a matrix of epoxy or other polymer makes an excellent high-strength structural
material. Proper selection of the cloth and/or unidirectional fibers offers the
ability to tailor strength and stiffness directly and to the desired levels to optimize
it for the purpose. The low density of graphite offers a weight advantage as well.
High temperature characteristics are improved by use of graphite instead of glass,
although the matrix is the final limiting factor. An increasing number of high-
temperature polymers are available for higher temperature structures.

In addition to graphite, Kevlar® and other high-strength fibers are increasingly
used.

* The inconel family of alloys and other similar alloys based on nickel, cobalt,
etc., are used for high-temperature applications. Typical application is as a heat
shield in the vicinity of a rocket nozzle to protect the lower temperature
components from thermal radiation or hot gas recirculation. These alloys are of
relatively high density, equal to that of steel or greater so, weight can be a

rapidly if heated in air, but a silicide coating offers substantial protection in this
environment.

Metal matrix composites involve use of a metal matrix, e.g., aluminum,
stiffened and strengthened by fibers of another metal or nonmetallic material. In
aluminum, for example, fibers of boron, silicon carbide, and graphite have been
used. Some difficulties have been encountered, such as the tendency of the molten

CONFIGURATION AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 431 
aluminum to react with the graphite during manufacture of the composite. Work 
on protective coatings continues. Boron-stiffened aluminum is well developed 
and is used in the tubular truss structure that makes up much of the center section 
of the shuttle orbiter. This entire area is one of enormous promise. As yet, we 
have hardly scratched the surface of the potential of this type of composite. 
Carbon-carbon composite consists of graphite fibers in a carbon matrix. It has 
the ability to hold shape and,resist ablation and even oxidation at quite a high 
temperature. For very high temperature use, an oxidation resistant coating, 
usually silicon carbide, is applied. At the present level of development, however, 
carbon-carbon is not suitable for a load-bearing structure. For example, it is used 
in the nose cap and wing leading edges of the shuttle orbiter where it must resist 
intense reentry heating, but it does not form a part of the load-bearing structure. 
Progress is being made in the development of structural carbon-carbon, and it is 
expected to have a bright future as a hot structure for high-speed atmospheric and

Carbon-silicon-carbide, carbon fiber in a silicon-carbide matrix, is making 
considerable progress as a high-temperature material. It shows promise of being 
as good as or better than carbon-carbon in terms of offering a high use 
temperature with better oxidation resistance. 
8.7.2 Films and Fabrics 
By far the most commonly used plastic film material in space applications has 
been ~~lar~~. This is a strong, transparent polymer that lends itself well to 
fabrication into sheets or films as thin as 0.00025 in. Coated with a few angstroms 
of aluminum to provide reflectivity, Mylarm is well suited to the fabrication of 
the multilayer insulation extensively used on spacecraft. 
A newer polymeric film material with higher strength and the ability to 
withstand higher temperature than ~~iarTM is the polyimide ~a~ton~. These 
characteristics have made ~a~ton~~ a desirable choice for outer layers of thermal 
blankets. A problem has arisen with the discovery that, in low Earth orbits, 
polymer surfaces undergo attack and erosion by atomic oxygen, which is 
prevalent at these altitudes (see Chapter 3). ~a~ton~ seems to be more 
susceptible to this sort of attack than M~IP. In any case, for long-life use in 
low orbit, metallization or coating with a more resistive polymer such as ~eflon@ 
will probably be required. The erosion rate is sufficiently low that, for shorter 
missions, the problem may not be serious. 
~eflon@ and polyethylene have been used extensively as bearings, rub strips, 
and in various protective functions because of their smoothness, inertness, and, 
particularly for ~eflon@, lubricative ability. 
Fiberglass cloth, which is strong and flexible, has been used as an insulator and 
as protective armor against micrometeoroids. A commercially available cloth of 
fiberglass coated with ~eflon@ called ~etaclothTM has been used as the external 
surface of spacecraft thermal blankets for this purpose.

aluminum to react with the graphite during manufacture of the composite. Work
on protective coatings continues. Boron-stiffened aluminum is well developed
and is used in the tubular truss structure that makes up much of the center section
of the shuttle orbiter. This entire area is one of enormous promise. As yet, we
have hardly scratched the surface of the potential of this type of composite.

Carbon-carbon composite consists of graphite fibers in a carbon matrix. It has
the ability to hold shape and resist ablation and even oxidation at quite a high
temperature. For very high temperature use, an oxidation resistant coating,
usually silicon carbide, is applied. At the present level of development, however,
carbon-carbon is not suitable for a load-bearing structure. For example, it is used
in the nose cap and wing leading edges of the shuttle orbiter where it must resist
intense reentry heating, but it does not form a part of the load-bearing structure.
Progress is being made in the development of structural carbon-carbon, and it is
expected to have a bright future as a hot structure for high-speed atmospheric and
entry vehicles.

Carbon-silicon-carbide, carbon fiber in a silicon-carbide matrix, is making
considerable progress as a high-temperature material. It shows promise of being
as good as or better than carbon-carbon in terms of offering a high use
temperature with better oxidation resistance.

8.7.2 Films and Fabrics

By far the most commonly used plastic film material in space applications has
been Mylar™. This is a strong, transparent polymer that lends itself well to
fabrication into sheets or films as thin as 0.00025 in. Coated with a few angstroms
of aluminum to provide reflectivity, Mylar™ js well suited to the fabrication of
the multilayer insulation extensively used on spacecraft.

A newer polymeric film material with higher strength and the ability to
withstand higher temperature than Mylar™ js the polyimide Kapton™, These
characteristics have made Kapton™ a desirable choice for outer layers of thermal
blankets. A problem has arisen with the discovery that, in low Earth orbits,
polymer surfaces undergo attack and erosion by atomic oxygen, which is
prevalent at these altitudes (see Chapter 3). Kapton™ seems to be more
susceptible to this sort of attack than Mylar™. In any case, for long-life use in
low orbit, metallization or coating with a more resistive polymer such as Teflon®
will probably be required. The erosion rate is sufficiently low that, for shorter
missions, the problem may not be serious.

Teflon® and polyethylene have been used extensively as bearings, rub strips,
and in various protective functions because of their smoothness, inertness, and,
particularly for Teflon®, lubricative ability.

Fiberglass cloth, which is strong and flexible, has been used as an insulator and
as protective armor against micrometeoroids. A commercially available cloth of
fiberglass coated with Teflon® called Betacloth™ has been used as the external
surface of spacecraft thermal blankets for this purpose.

432 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
A variety of materials superficially similar to fiberglass but of much higher 
temperature capacity are available. These materials are made from fibers of high- 
temperature ceramic material and are available as batting, woven cloth, and 
thread. The most well-known application of such materials is as the flexible 
reusable surface insulation (FRSI) used on the upper surfaces of the later-model 
shuttle orbiters. They can also be useful as insulators of high-temperature devices 
such as rocket engines. 
8.7.3 Future Trends I 
As has been the case in the past, future trends in materials will be 
characterized by a desire for increased specific strength and specific stiffness. 
The latter will tend to dominate because, as observed earlier, most space structure 
designs are driven by stiffness more than strength. Higher thermal conductivity 
with lower coefficient of thermal expansion is also highly desirable for obvious I 
reasons. Figure 8.16 indicates desirable trends in stiffness and thermal 
characteristics. The currently available materials are grouped to the left with 
beryllium still showing an edge even over the composites. Graphite-aluminum 
offers the possibility of substantial improvement once its problems are solved, I 
and graphite-magnesium shows even greater promise for the future. It is quite 
probable that other candidates will emerge as research continues. 
Damping capability is also important as a means of reducing sensitivity to 
vibration and shock. Figure 8.17 rates damping ability vs density. The common 
aerospace alloys are generally poor, magnesium being the best. Excellent 
dampers are available as indicated toward the upper right hand; however, they 
tend to be heavy, dirty, and relatively weak and have a high DBT temperature. All 
of these characteristics make them unusable for space applications. The 
developing field of composites may offer the best hope of achieving the goal, 
although the present trend to use high-stiffness fibers may make this difficult.

9.1 Introduction

The thermal control engineer’s task is to maintain the temperature of all

Thermal control as a space vehicle design discipline is unusual in that, given

require very little special-purpose spacecraft hardware. More demanding
missions may require extra equipment such as radiators, heat pipes, etc., to be
discussed in the following sections. In all cases, however, the required analysis
will involve the thermal control engineer in the design of nearly all other onboard
subsystems.

As with attitude control, thermal control techniques may be broadly grouped

because of simplicity, reliability, and cost. Passive control includes the use of
sunshades and cooling fins, special paint or coatings, insulating blankets, heat

When the mission requirements are too severe for passive techniques, active

9.2 Spacecraft Thermal Environment 
Comments on the space thermal environment were offered in Chapter 3 as part 
of our discussion of the overall space environment. However, it is useful to 
expand on our earlier discussion prior to considering the design features that are 
intended to deal with that environment. 
The spacecraft thermal environment can vary considerably, depending upon a 
variety of naturally occurring effects. Orbital characteristics are a major source of 
variation. For example, most spacecraft orbits will have an eclipse period; 
however, as the orbit precesses, the time and duration of the eclipse will vary, 
particularly for a highly elliptic orbit. Obviously, for a spacecraft in 
interplanetary flight where the orbit is about the sun, the solar intensity will 
vary as the distance from the sun changes. As discussed in Chapter 4, even the 
solar intensity experienced in orbit around the Earth will vary seasonally (from an 
average value of 1388 w/m2) because of the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit 
around the sun. 
In addition to direct solar input to the spacecraft, there will be reflected solar 
input to the vehicle from whatever planet it orbits. This reflected solar energy 
input depends on the orbital altitude, the planetary reflectivity or albedo, and the 
orbital inclination. Reflected solar input decreases with altitude, as does the range 
of variation that must be accommodated. Planetary albedo varies with latitude 
and, depending on the planet and its surface features, possibly longitude and 
season as well. Values can range from a lower limit of roughly 5% to over 85%. 
Interestingly, the lunar surface, which appears quite bright from Earth, has a very 
low average albedo. The upper end of the range would be represented by 
reflection of sunlight from heavy cloud cover on Earth. The albedo will also be a 
Btrong function of wavelength. This can be a problem because it can be difficult to 
find surface materials or coatings that are good reflectors across a wide spectrum 
of wavelengths. As we will see, polished surfaces that are good reflectors in the 
visible spectrum may well be very efficient absorbers at infrared. A worst-case 
scenario in this regard might be low-altitude flight over the day side of the planet 
Mercury, where infrared irradiance from the surface will be a major factor in the 
design. 
Operational activities alter the thermal environment as well. Very low orbital 
altitudes can produce heating due to free-molecular flow (see Chapter 6). 
Spacecraft attitude may change, resulting in exposure of differing areas and 
surface treatments to the sun and to space. Onboard equipment may be turned on 
or off, resulting in changes in the amount of internally generated heat. In the 
course of thruster firings, local cooling may occur in tanks or lines due to gas 
expansion at the same time as local heating may occur in the vicinity of hot gas

9.2 Spacecraft Thermal Environment

Comments on the space thermal environment were offered in Chapter 3 as part

expand on our earlier discussion prior to considering the design features that are
intended to deal with that environment.

The spacecraft thermal environment can vary considerably, depending upon a

however, as the orbit precesses, the time and duration of the eclipse will vary,

thrusters. Expenditure of propellant reduces the thermal mass of the tanks and the 
spacecraft as a whole, resulting in differences in the transient response to 
changing conditions. 
As flight time in space increases, spacecraft surface characteristics change due 
to ultraviolet exposure, atomic oxygen attack, rnicrometeoroid/debris impact, 
etc. This will affect both the absorptivity and emissivity of the surfaces and must 
be considered in the design of long-life spacecraft. 
Anomalous events provide an unpredictable source of change in the thermal 
environment. A failure in a wiring harness may cause loss of part of the solar 
array power, or a power-consuming instrument may fail, thus reducing internally 
generated heat. A sun shade or shield may fail to deploy, louvers may stick, etc. 
Although one cannot predict every possible problem, nor can a spacecraft be 
designed to tolerate every possible anomaly, it is desirable to provide some 
margin in the design to allow for operation at off-design conditions. 
9.3 Thermal Control Methods 
9.3.1 Passive Thermal Control 
The techniques applied for passive thermal control include the use of 
geometry, coatings, insulation blankets, sun shields, radiating fins, and heat 
pipes. By "geometry" we imply the process of configuring the spacecraft to 
provide the required thermal radiating area, placing low-temperature objects in 
shadow, and exposing high-temperature objects to the sun or burying them 
deeply within the structure, and other similar manipulation of the spacecraft 
configuration to optimize thermal control. 
Insulation blankets typically feature a multilayer design consisting of several 
layers of aluminized Mylar or other plastic, spaced with nylon or Dacron mesh. 
External coverings of fiberglass, ~acron~, or other materials may be used to 
protect against solar ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen erosion, and 
micrometeoroid damage. 
Sun shields may be as simple as polished, or perhaps gold plated, aluminum 
sheet. More sophisticated reflectors may use silvered ~eflon@, which essentially 
acts as a second-surface mirror with the silver on the back to provide visible-light 
reflectivity, with the ~eflon@ providing high infrared emissivity. Along the same 
line are actual glass second-surface mirrors, which are more thermally efficient, 
but have the cost of greater weight and possible problems with the brittle glass. 
Fins are often used where it is necessary to dissipate large amounts of heat, or 
smaller amounts at low temperature, thus requiring a large cooling surface area. 
Large numbers of fins in circular configurations will have difficulty obtaining an 
adequate view factor to space. Very long fins may be limited in effectiveness by 
the ability to co~lduct heat through the fins.

Insulation blankets typically feature a multilayer design consisting of several
layers of aluminized Mylar or other plastic, spaced with nylon or Dacron mesh.
External coverings of fiberglass, Dacron®, or other materials may be used to
protect against solar ultraviolet radiation, atomic oxygen erosion, and
micrometeoroid damage.

Sun shields may be as simple as polished, or perhaps gold plated, aluminum
sheet. More sophisticated reflectors may use silvered Teflon®, which essentially
acts as a second-surface mirror with the silver on the back to provide visible-light
reflectivity, with the Teflon® providing high infrared emissivity. Along the same
line are actual glass second-surface mirrors, which are more thermally efficient,
but have the cost of greater weight and possible problems with the brittle glass.

Fins are often used where it is necessary to dissipate large amounts of heat, or
smaller amounts at low temperature, thus requiring a large cooling surface area.
Large numbers of fins in circular configurations will have difficulty obtaining an
adequate view factor to space. Very long fins may be limited in effectiveness by
the ability to conduct heat through the fins.

438 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Heat pipes are tubular devices containing a wick running the length of the 
pipe, which is partially filled with a fluid such as ammonia. The pipe is connected 
between a portion of the spacecraft from which heat is to be removed and a I 
portion to which it is to be dumped. The fluid evaporates from the hot end, and the 
vapor is driven to condense (thus releasing its' heat of vaporization) at the cold 
end. Condensed fluid in the cold end is then drawn by capillary action back to the 
hot end. I 
Some may question whether heat pipes belong in the passive category, 
because there is active circulation of fluid within the heat pipe driven by the heat 
flow. We consider heat pipes to be passive from the viewpoint of the spacecraft 
designer because there is no direct control function required, nor is there a I 
requirement for the spacecraft to expend energy. The heat pipe simply conducts 
energy when there is a temperature differential and ceases to do so if the 
differential disappears. Control of heat pipes is possible by means of loaded gas 
reservoirs or valves. This of course reduces the advantages of simplicity and 
reliability that are inherent in the basic design. I 
Caution in using heat pipes is required to make sure that the hot end is not so 
hot as to dry the wick completely, thus rendering capillary action ineffective in 
transporting new fluid into that end. Similarly, the cold end must not be so cold as 
to freeze the liquid. Also, heat pipes work quite differently in Og because of the I 
absence of free convection, making interpretation of ground test results a problem 
unless the heat pipe is operating horizontally. It is customary to provide a 50% 
margin in energy transfer capacity when sizing a heat pipe for spacecraft 
applications. 
9.3.2 Actfve Thermal Control 
Active thermal control of spacecraft may require devices such as heaters and 
coolers, shutters or louvers, or cryogenic materials. Thermal transport may be 
actively implemented by pumped circulation loops. 
Heaters usually are wire-wound resistance heaters, or possibly deposited 
resistance strip heaters. Control may be by means of ground command, or 
automatically with onboard thermostats, or both. For very small heaters where 
on/off control is not required, radioisotope heaters are sometimes used. The usual 
size is 1-W thermal output. It might be argued that such devices are passive, 
because they cannot be commanded and do not draw spacecraft power. 
Various cooling devices have been applied or are under consideration. 
Refrigeration cycles such as those that are used on Earth are difficult to operate in 
Og and have seen little or no use. Thermoelectric or Peltier cooling has been used 
with some success for cooling small, well-insulated objects. The primary 
application is to the cooling of detector elements in infrared observational 
instruments that are operated for long periods. The Villaumier refrigerator is of

Some may question whether heat pipes belong in the passive category,
because there is active circulation of fluid within the heat pipe driven by the heat
flow. We consider heat pipes to be passive from the viewpoint of the spacecraft
designer because there is no direct control function required, nor is there a
requirement for the spacecraft to expend energy. The heat pipe simply conducts
energy when there is a temperature differential and ceases to do so if the
differential disappears. Control of heat pipes is possible by means of loaded gas
reservoirs or valves. This of course reduces the advantages of simplicity and
reliability that are inherent in the basic design.

Caution in using heat pipes is required to make sure that the hot end is not so
hot as to dry the wick completely, thus rendering capillary action ineffective in
transporting new fluid into that end. Similarly, the cold end must not be so cold as
to freeze the liquid. Also, heat pipes work quite differently in Og because of the
absence of free convection, making interpretation of ground test results a problem
unless the heat pipe is operating horizontally. It is customary to provide a 50%
margin in energy transfer capacity when sizing a heat pipe for spacecraft
applications.

9.3.2 Active Thermal Control

Active thermal control of spacecraft may require devices such as heaters and
coolers, shutters or louvers, or cryogenic materials. Thermal transport may be
actively implemented by pumped circulation loops. ~

Heaters usually are wire-wound resistance heaters, or possibly deposited
resistance strip heaters. Control may be by means of ground command, or
automatically with onboard thermostats, or both. For very small heaters where
on/off control is not required, radioisotope heaters are sometimes used. The usual
size is 1-W thermal output. It might be argued that such devices are passive,
because they cannot be commanded and do not draw spacecraft power.

Various cooling devices have been applied or are under consideration.
Refrigeration cycles such as those that are used on Earth are difficult to operate in
Og and have seen little or no use. Thermoelectric or Peltier cooling has been used
with some success for cooling small, well-insulated objects. The primary
application is to the cooling of detector elements in infrared observational
instruments that are operated for long periods. The Villaumier refrigerator is of

THERMAL CONTROL 439 
considerable interest for Similar applications, and development of such devices 
has been in progress for many years. 
A straightforward device that has seen considerable use is the cryostat, which 
depends on expansion of a high-pressure gas through an orifice to achieve 
cooling. To achieve very low temperature, two-stage cryostats using nitrogen in 
the first stage and hydrogen in the second have been used. The nitrogen, expanded 
from high pressure, precools the system-to near liquid nitrogen temperature. The 
hydrogen, expanding into the precooled system, can then approach liquid 
hydrogen temperatures, thus cooling the instrument detectors to very low 
temperatures. Other gases may be used as well. 
For long-term cooling to low temperature, an effective approach is to use a 
cryogenic fluid. The principal applications have been to spacecraft designed for 
infrared measurements, such as the infrared astronomy satellite (IRAS), launched 
in 1983, or the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) spacecraft, launched in 
1989. In these spacecraft, cooling is achieved by expansion of supercritical 
helium (stored at 4.2 K) through a porous plug to as low as 1.6 K. This allows 
observations at very long infrared wavelengths with the minimum possible 
interference to the telescope from its own heat. 
IRAS performed the first all-sky infrared (IR) survey, expiring after nearly 11 
months of operation, upon depletion of its helium. The more sophisticated COBE 
spacecraft showed that the cosmic microwave background spectrum is that of a 
nearly perfect blackbody at a temperature of 2.725 f 0.002 K, an observation that 
closely matches the-predictions of the so-called Big Bang theory.3 The COBE 
helium supply was depleted after approximately 10 months of operation. 
The DoD/Missile Defense Agency's Mid-course Space Experiment (MSX) 
included an infrared telescope for the purpose of tracking missiles and reentry 
vehicles. It was launched in 1996 and, like COBE, operated for about 10 months. 
While this telescope was routinely used for military surveillance experiments, 
some observing time was also devoted to astronomical observations. MSX 
utilized a block of solid hydrogen as its fundamental coolant, offering a step up in 
sophistication from the IRAS/COBE experience. 
The observational lifetime of each of these satellites was less than a year, at 
least for their far-infrared instruments, due to exhaustion of their onboard 
refrigerant, even though all other systems were still functioning. This provides a 
strong argument for the development of both cryogenic refrigerators and cost- 
effective on-orbit servicing techniques, neither of which has yet reached the 
required level of maturity. 
Shutters or louvers are among the most common active thermal control 
devices. Common implementations are the louver, which essentially resembles a 
venetian blind, or the flat plate with cutouts. 
The former may be seen in the Voyager spacecraft illustration in Chapter 8. A 
fixed outside plate with pie-slice cutouts is provided. Between that plate and the

nearly perfect blackbody at a temperature of 2.725 + 0.002 K, an observation that
closely matches the predictions of the so-called Big Bang theory.? The COBE
helium supply was depleted after approximately 10 months of operation.

bimetallic spring. When the spacecraft becomes warm, the plate moves to place 
the cutouts in registration, and thus expose the spacecraft skin to space. When the 
spacecraft becomes too cold, the movable plate rotates to close the cutouts in the 
fixed plate, thus reducing the exposure of the spacecraft skin to space. 
The flat-plate variety is shown on the Television and Infrared Observation I 
SatellitelDefense Meteorological Satellite Program (TIROS/DMSP) spacecraft 
illustration in Chapter 8. The flat plate is rotated by the bimetallic element. The

and rotate over unirisulated areas to increase heat flow and cool the spacecraft. 
The flat-plate variety is much simpler and less costly but allows less efficient use I 
of surface area and fine tuning of areas on a given surface. Although the

obviously possible to provide commanded operation as well, either instead of the 
thermostatic approach or as an override to it. 
Actively pumped fluid loops, conceptually identical to the cooling system in 
an automobile engine, have a long history of spaceflight applications. In this I 
approach, a tube or pipe containing the working fluid is routed to a heat 
exchanger in the area or region to be heated or cooled. Heat transfer occurs via 
forced convection (see the following section) into the fluid. The fluid is circulated 
to an energy source or sink, where the appropriate reverse heat exchange takes 
place. Working fluids in typical applications include air, water, methanol, water/ I 
methanol, water/glycol, Freon, carbon tetrachloride, and o$ers. 
The most visible space application of this cooling technique is to the space 
shuttle, where the payload-bay doors contain extensive cooling radiators that, 
while on orbit, are exposed to dark space. Indeed, the doors must be opened I 
shortly after orbital injection or the mission must be aborted and'the shuttle

the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. The Apollo lunar surface suits 
featured water-cooled underwear with a heat exchanger in the astronaut's 
backpack. 
Active fluid cooling was also briefly mentioned in Chapter 5 in connection 
with regenerative engine nozzle cooling. This technique, while complex, is a 
primary factor enabling the design of high thrust-to-weight rocket engines.

All three mechanisms will be discussed in the sections that follow.

THERMAL CONTROL 441 
9.4.1 Conductive Heat Transfer J 
Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases. It is usually the primary 
mechanism for heat transfer within a spacecraft (although radiation may be 
important in internal cavities). Because all electronic devices generate at least 
some heat while in operation, there exists a risk of overheating if care is not taken 
to provide adequate paths to conduct heat from the component to the appropriate 
heat rejection surface. 
Of course, the same concern exists with ground-based equipment. However, 
thermal design of such equipment is usually much less of a problem because of 
the efficiency of free convection in providing heat relief. It is also largely self- 
regulating. In special cases, such as cooling the processor chip of a computer or 
the final amplifier stage of a radio transmitter, the ground-based designer can 
provide a small fan to ensure forced convection over a particular area. Free 
convection is unavailable in space, even in pressurized spacecraft, because of the 
lack of gravity, and fan cooling is generally found only in manned spacecraft. 
1 Deliberate provision of adequate conduction paths is therefore a key requirement 
for the spacecraft thermal engineer. 
Design practice in providing thermal conduction involves more than selecting 
a material with suitable conductivity. For example, unwelded joints, especially in 
I vacuum, are very poor thermal conductors. Worse yet, they may exhibit a factor 
of two or more variability in conduction between supposedly identical joints. 
This situation can be substantially improved by use of conduction pads, thermal 
grease, or metal-loaded epoxy in joints that are mechanically fastened. Obviously 
this is only done where high or repeatable conductivity is essential to the design. 
Regarding materials selection, it is found that high thermal conductivity and 
high electrical conductivity normally are closely related. Therefore, a situation in 
which high thermal conductivity is required while electrical isolation is 
maintained is often difficult. One substance that is helpful is beryllium oxide 
(BeO), which has high thermal conductivity but is an excellent electrical 
I insulator. Care must be taken in the use of BeO, which in powder form is highly 
toxic if breathed.

Generally, one wishes to solve the conduction equation to obtain the 
temperature distribution in some region. This region will be defined by the 
coordinates of its boundary, along which certain conditions must be specified to 
allow a solution to be obtained. In the example of Fig. 9.1, the infinite slab is 
defined as a region by faces at x = 0 and x = L, with no specification on its extent 
in the y and 7: directions. (Equivalently, the slab may be considered to be well

One might wish to know the temperature at all points within (0, L) given

be specified on a given boundary. For a transient problem, the initial temperature

It is seen that To is now obtained as a solved quantity instead of a known

specify simultaneously both the face temperature and also the heat flux. 
Moreover, two boundary conditions are always required; specification of one face 
temperature, or the heat flux alone, is insufficient. 
This is a simple but useful example to which we will return. In transient cases, 
or if two- or three-dimensional analysis is required, or when internal sources of

treatment of a variety of useful basic cases. 
One particularly useful transient case is that of the semi-infinite solid initially 
at temperature To at time to = 0, with a suddenly applied temperature T, or flux 
q, at x = 0 for t > 0. The geometry is that of Fig. 9.1, with L + co. With no

It should be appreciated that the solutions of Eqs. (9.13) and (9.16) are of more

To obtain a closed-form analytic solution to Eq. (9.4) requires, at a minimum, 
that the boundary surfaces be constant-coordinate surfaces (in whatever 
coordinate system the problem is posed), and that g(r, t) be of very simple 
form. When these conditions are not satisfied, a situation more common than 
otherwise in engineering practice, numerical solution of the governing equations 
is required. We will touch on this topic in later sections. 
9.4.3 Convective Heat Transfer 
Of all the heat transfer mechanisms, convection is the most difficult to analyze,

To obtain a closed-form analytic solution to Eq. (9.4) requires, at a minimum,
that the boundary surfaces be constant-coordinate surfaces (in whatever
coordinate system the problem is posed), and that g(r, 1) be of very simple
form. When these conditions are not satisfied, a situation more common than
otherwise in engineering practice, numerical solution of the governing equations
is required. We will touch on this topic in later sections.

9.4.3. Convective Heat Transfer

Of all the heat transfer mechanisms, convection is the most difficult to analyze,
predict, or control. This is because it is essentially a fluid dynamic phenomenon,
with behavior dependent on many factors not easily measurable or predictable.
Part of the problem arises because convection is in truth not a heat transfer
mechanism at all. The energy is still transferred by conduction or radiation, but
the conditions defining the transfer are highly modified by mass transport in the
fluid. This is illustrated schematically in Fig. 9.2.

So-called free convection is driven entirely by density differences and thus 
occurs only in a gravitational field. It does not occur in space except when the 
spacecraft is accelerating. However, it does occur unavoidably on Earth and 
thoroughly skews the application to vacuum conditions of any heat transfer data 
that might be obtained from testing the spacecraft in the atmosphere. This fact is a 
primary (but not the sole) reason for conducting spacecraft thermal vacuum tests 
prior to launch. It is literally the only opportunity available to the thermal control 
analyst to verify his results in something approximating a space environment. 
If convective heat transfer is required in Og, it must be forced convection, 
driven by a pump, fan, or other circulation mechanism. The interior of a manned 
spacecraft cabin is one example. Another might be a propellant or pressurization 
tank where good thermal coupling to the walls is required. Forced convection is 
not commonly used as a significant means of unmanned spacecraft thermal 
control in U.S. or European spacecraft. However, Russian spacecraft have 
historically made extensive use of sealed, pressurized unmanned spacecraft with 
fans for circulation as a means of achieving uniform temperature and presumably 
to avoid the concern of operating some components in a vacuum. There is an 
obvious uadeoff here; design is much easier, but overall reliability may be lower 
because the integrity of the pressure hull is crucial to spacecraft survival. 
A spacecraft having the mission of landing on a planet with an atmosphere, or 
operating within that atmosphere, must of course be designed to deal with the 
new environment, including free convection, as well as operation on Earth and 
during launch and interplahetary cruise. Although no such design problem can be 
viewed as trivial, the Mars environment presents unusual challenges. An 
atmosphere exists, but it is approximately equivalent to that of Earth at 30-km 
altitude. There is enough atmosphere to allow free convection to be significant, 
but not enough for it to be the dominant heat transfer mechanism that it is on 
Earth. Solar radiation is lower by a factor of two than on Earth, but is not so low 
that it can be ignored in the daytime, particularly at lower latitudes. The thin 
atmosphere does not retain heat once the sun has set, resulting in thermal 
extremes that approach those of orbital flight. Finally, windblown dust will settle 
on the lander surface, altering its thermal radiation properties and greatly 
complicating the analysis that must be done in the design phase. Although other 
planetary environments can be much harsher in particular respects, few if any 
offer as much variability as does Mars. 
As discussed earlier, convection is important for space applications in various 
types of pumped cooling loops such as cold plates for electronics, regeneratively 
cooled rocket engines, and waste heat radiators. This of course is forced 
convection involving the special case of pipe or channel flow. 
Convective heating is the critical mechanism controlling entry heating. It 
completely overpowers the radiative component untif the entry velocity begins to 
approach Earth escape velocity. Even then, convection is still the more significant 
contributor. Similarly, it is the major mechanism in ascent aerodynamic heating.

proportional to both the surface area and the temperature difference. The
convective heat flux into the wall may then be written according to Newton’s law

driving temperature differential from 7; and 7,,, the fluid and wall temperatures.
As before, it is often more useful to deal with the heat flux,

Equation (9.18) is the analog to Eg. (9.9) for one-dimensional heat conduction,
with h, assuming the role of «/L, where we recall that L is the characteristic
thickness of the slab through which the heat flows.

Recalling the one-dimensional transient heat conduction solution given
earlier, we may have the case where a convective heat flux of the form of Eq.
(9.18) is suddenly applied to the surface of a semi- infinite solid. Gebhart? gives
the solution for temperature within the solid as

T(x) — Tp _ he {he he
a a erfc 7 exp] (x+ a1) fente(n + % at) (9.19)

The crucial element in Eq. (9.18) is the coefficient h,. Values for h,. are for the
most part both empirical and highly variable. Engineering handbooks® publish
charts or tables giving ranges of values for the 4, under varying sets of conditions,
but the variance is usually significant, and’ tests under the specific conditions
being considered may be required if the necessary accuracy is to be obtained.
Because convective heat transfer is a mass transport phenomenon as well as a
thermal one, the coefficient depends strongly on whether the flow is laminar or
turbulent, with the turbulent value being much higher. Thus, a laminar-to-
turbulent transition along the surface of an entry body may result in a substantial

In most cases, convective heat transfer will result in a higher flux than with

Newton's law of cooling is of course an approximation. The problem of heat 
transfer from a moving fluid to a boundary wall is a fluid dynamic problem, 
sometimes one that may be analyzed by means of particular approximations. If 
the fluid is a coolant in a pipe or tube, it may often be idealized as axisymrnetric 
or one-dimensional incompressible viscous flow, for which closed-fom solutions 
exist.'' 
At the other extreme is the flow of high-speed air along an exterior wall, for 
which we may apply the approximations of boundary-layer theory, which again 
yields numerous practical results. These have been discussed in Chapter 6, in 
connection with reentry vehicle heating. In either case, the analytical solution of a 
problem allows us to compute the value of h, for use in the convection law. 
However, all of our comments elsewhere in this text concerning the intractability 
of fluid dynamics problems apply here as well; thus, direct solution for the film 
coefficient is restricted to a few special cases such as those just described. 
It is both customary and advantageous in fluid dynamics to work in terms of 
non-dimensional parameters. In convection analyses, the appropriate parameter 
is the Nusselt number, defined as the ratio of convective energy transfer to 
conductive energy transfer under comparable conditions. For example, in the 
one-dimensional case just discussed, assume a wall is heated by a slab of fluid 
having thickness L and mass-averaged temperature Tf. If the fluid is stagnant, 
then from Eq. (9.9) the heat flux into the wall is

Thus, heat transfer at low Nusselt number, of order one, is essentially conductive; 
the slow flow of fluid through a long pipe offers a good example. High Nusselt 
number (100- 1000) implies efficient convection; in the pipe example, this would 
correspond to rapid, turbulent flow in the pipe. Convective heat transfer 
experiments (or computations) are very frequently expressed in terms of the 
Nusselt number. 
Equation (9.22) allows us to rewrite Newton's law of cooling in terms of 
Nusselt number and thermal conductivity, 
In this example, L was the thickness of the fluid slab. In a more general situation, I 
L is a characteristic length scale for the particular case of interest. In the important 
special case of axisymmetric pipe flow, the pipe diameter D would be the natural 
choice. In the more general case of flow in a duct of arbitrary cross section, D is 
commonly taken to be the hydraulic diameter, given by 
where A is the cross-sectional area of the flow, and P is the wetted perimeter of I

To illustrate the application of the Nusselt number in heat transfer analysis, we 
continue with our circular pipe-flow example. For fully developed laminar flow 
(i.e., low-speed flow several pipe diameters downstream from the entrance), the 
Nusselt number is found to be8 
Nu = 3.66 (constant pipe wall temperature) (9.25a) 
Nu = 4.36 (constant pipe wall heat flux) (9.25b)

In this example, L was the thickness of the fluid slab. In a more general situation,
Lis a characteristic length scale for the particular case of interest. In the important

A feel for the uncertainty inherent in the use of empirical correlations such as 
Eq. (9.2%) may be gained by recognizing that this result is not unique. Various 
refinements have been published; for example, it has been found that using ~r 0.3 
for cooling and for heating yields slightly more accurate results. 
Results such as those just presented can be used to estimate the power per unit 
area, or flux, that can be extracted via forced convection in pipes or tubes, and are 
given here primarily for illustrative purposes. However, it should be understood 
that many other questions remain to be answered in the design of a practical 
cooling system. For example, a pump will be needed to move fluid through the 
system. Fluid flow in lengthy pipes will be subject to substantial friction; bends in 
the pipe as needed to realize a compact design add to this friction, which affects 
the size and power required of the pump. We ignore all such issues in favor of the 
more specialized references cited earlier. 
9.4.5 Radiative Heat Transfer 
Radiation is typically the only practical means of heat transfer between a 
vehicle in space and its external environment. Mass expulsion is obviously used 
as a spacecraft coolant when open-cycle cryogenic cooling is performed, as 
already discussed for IRAS, COBE. and MSX, but this should be regarded as a 
special case. As noted previously, radiation becomes important as a heat transfer 
mode during atmospheric entry at speeds above about 10 km/s. Even at entry 
speeds of 1 I .2 km/s (Earth escape velocity), however, it still accounts for only 
about 25% of the total entry heat flux. At very high entry speeds, such as those 
encountered by the Galileo atmospheric probe at Jupiter, radiative heat transfer 
dominates. 
Radiative energy transfer can strongly influence the design of certain entry 
vehicles, particularly those ;here gliding entry is employed. Because convective 
heating is the major source of energy input, the entry vehicle surface temperature 
will continue to grow until energy dissipation due to thermal radiation exactly 
balances the convective input. This illustrates the reason for and importance of a 
good insulator (such as the shuttle tiles) for surface coating of such a vehicle. It is 
essential to confine the energy to the surface, not allowing it to soak back into the 
primary structure. Tauber and yang9 provide an excellent survey of design 
tradeoffs for maneuvering entry vehicles. 
Radiative heat transfer is a function of the temperature of the emitting and 
receiving bodies, the surface materials of the bodies, the intervening medium, and 
the relative geometry. The aensity, or energy per unit area, is proportional to 
l/r2 for a point source. If the distance is sufficient, almost any object may be 
considered a point source. An example is the sun, which subtends a significant arc

A feel for the uncertainty inherent in the use of empirical correlations such as
Eq. (9.25c) may be gained by recognizing that this result is not unique. Various
refinements have been published; for example, it has been found that using Pr°?
for cooling and Pr°* for heating yields slightly more accurate results.

Results such as those just presented can be used to estimate the power per unit
area, or flux, that can be extracted via forced convection in pipes or tubes, and are
given here primarily for illustrative purposes. However, it should be understood
that many other questions remain to be answered in the design of a practical
cooling system. For example, a pump will be needed to move fluid through the
system. Fluid flow in lengthy pipes will be subject to substantial friction; bends in
the pipe as needed to realize a compact design add to this friction, which affects
the size and power required of the pump. We ignore all such issues in favor of the
more specialized references cited earlier.

9.4.5 Radiative Heat Transfer

Radiation is typically the only practical means of heat transfer between a
vehicle in space and its external environment. Mass expulsion is obviously used
as a spacecraft coolant when open-cycle cryogenic cooling is performed, as
already discussed for IRAS, COBE, and MSX, but this should be regarded as a
special case. As noted previously, radiation becomes important as a heat transfer
mode during atmospheric entry at speeds above about 10 km/s. Even at entry
speeds of 11.2 km/s (Earth escape velocity), however, it still accounts for only
about 25% of the total entry heat flux. At very high entry speeds, such as those
encountered by the Galileo atmospheric probe at Jupiter, radiative heat transfer
dominates.

Radiative energy transfer can strongly influence the design of certain entry
vehicles, particularly those where gliding entry is employed. Because convective
heating is the major source of energy input, the entry vehicle surface temperature
will continue to grow until energy dissipation due to thermal radiation exactly
balances the convective input. This illustrates the reason for and importance of a
good insulator (such as the shuttle tiles) for surface coating of such a vehicle. It is
essential to confine the energy to the surface, not allowing it to soak back into the
primary structure. Tauber and Yang” provide an excellent survey of design
tradeoffs for maneuvering entry vehicles.

Radiative heat transfer is a function of the temperature of the emitting and
receiving bodies, the surface materials of the bodies, the intervening medium, and
the relative geometry. The infensity, or energy per unit area, is proportional to
1/r? for a point source. If the distance is sufficient, almost any object may be
considered a point source. An example is the sun, which subtends a significant arc

452 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
in the sky as viewed fr%m Earth but may be considered a point source for most 
purposes in thermal control. 
The ability to tailor the aborptivity and emissivity of spacecraft internal and 
external surfaces by means of coatings, surface treatment, etc., offers a simple 
and flexible means of passive spacecraft thermal control. Devices such as the 
louvers and movable flat-plate shades discussed previously may be viewed as 
active means of varying the effective total emissivity of the spacecraft. 
It will be seen that the heat flux from a surface varies as the fourth power of its 
temperature. Thus, for heat rejection at low temperature a relatively large area 
will be required. This may constitute a problem in terms of spacecraft 
configuration geometry, where one must simultaneously provide an adequate 
view factor to space, compact launch vehicle stowage, and minimal weight. 
9.4.6 * Stefan-Boltzmann Law 
Radiative heat transfer may be defined as the transport of energy by 
electromagnetic waves emitted by all bodies at a temperature greater than 0 K. 
For purposes of thermal control, our primary interest lies in wavelengths between 
approximately 200 nm and 200 ym, the region between the middle ultraviolet 
and the far infrared. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power emitted by 
such a body is 
where Tis the surface temperature, A the surface area, and E the emissivity (unity 
for a blackbody, as we will discuss later). The Stefan-Boltzmann constant u is 
5.67 x lo-' w/m2. K~. 
Notation conventions in radiometry are notoriously confusing and are often 
inconsistent with those used in other areas of thermal control. To the extent that a 
standard notation exists, it is probably best exemplified by Siege1 and   ow ell,"

total emissive power e as 
The name derives from the fact that each area element of a surface can "see" a 
hemisphere above itself. The quantity e is the energy emitted, including all 
wavelengths, into this hemisphere per unit time and per unit area.

in the sky as viewed from Earth but may be considered a point source for most
purposes in thermal control.

The ability to tailor the aborptivity and emissivity of spacecraft internal and
external surfaces by means of coatings, surface treatment, etc., offers a simple
and flexible means of passive spacecraft thermal control. Devices such as the
louvers and movable flat-plate shades discussed previously may be viewed as
active means of varying the effective total emissivity of the spacecraft.

It will be seen that the heat flux from a surface varies as the fourth power of its
temperature. Thus, for heat rejection at low temperature a relatively large area
will be required. This may constitute a problem in terms of spacecraft
configuration geometry, where one must simultaneously provide an adequate
view factor to space, compact launch vehicle stowage, and minimal weight.

9.4.6 : Stefan-Boltzmann Law

Radiative heat transfer may be defined as the transport of energy by
electromagnetic waves emitted by all bodies at a temperature greater than 0 K.
For purposes of thermal control, our primary interest lies in wavelengths between
approximately 200 nm and 200 um, the region between the middle ultraviolet
and the far infrared. The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the power emitted by
such a body is

OQ = eoAT* (9.28)

where T is the surface temperature, A the surface area, and € the emissivity (unity
for a blackbody, as we will discuss later). The Stefan-Boltzmann constant o is
5.67 x 1078 W/m?-K*.

Notation conventions in radiometry are notoriously confusing and are often
inconsistent with those used in other areas of thermal control. To the extent that a
standard notation exists, it is probably best exemplified by Siegel and Howell,!°
and we will adopt it here. Using this convention, we define the hemispherical
total emissive power e as

W

e=q= 2 = eoT* (9.29)

The name derives from the fact that each area element of a surface can “see” a
hemisphere above itself. The quantity e is the energy emitted, including all
wavelengths, into this hemisphere per unit time and per unit area.

9.4.7 The Blackbody

The blackbody, as the term is used in radiative heat transfer, is an idealization.
By definition, the blackbody neither reflects nor transmits incident energy. It is a
perfect absorber at all wavelengths and all angles of incidence. As a result,

THERMAL CONTROL 453 
provable by elementary energy-balance arguments, it also emits the maximum 
possible energy at all wavelengths and angles for a given temperature. The total 
radiant energy emitted is a function of temperature only. 
Although true blackbodies do not exist, their characteristics are closely 
approached by certain finely divided powders such as carbon black, gold black, 
platinum black, and Carborundum. It is also possible to create structures that 
approximate blackbody behavior. For example, an array of parallel grooves (such 
as a stack of razor blades) or a honeycomb arrangement of cavities can be made to 
resemble a blackbody. Such structures may be used in radiometers. 
The actual emissivity E and absorptivity a that characterize how real bodies 
emit and absorb electromagnetic radiations often differ in value and are 
dissimilar functions of temperature, incidence angle, wavelength, surface 
roughness, and chemical composition. These differences can be used by the 
spacecraft designer to control its temperature. As an example, a surface might be 
chosen to be highly reflective in the visible light band to reduce absorption of 
sunlight and highly emissive in the infrared to enhance heat rejection. Silver- 
plated ~eflon@ was mentioned earlier as one material having such properties.

“gray” implies an absence of wavelength dependence. A “diffuse” surface offers
no specular reflection to an incident beam; energy is reflected from the surface

where 8 is the angle from the surface normal to the line of sight. Thus, the 
reflected energy is distributed exactly as is energy emitted from a black surface; it 
looks the same to viewers at any angle. Reflected energy so distributed is said to 
follow Lambert's cosine law; a surface with this property is called a Lambertian 
surface. A fuzzy object such as a tennis ball or a cloud-covered planet such as 
Venus represents a good example of a diffuse or Lambertian reflector. Surfaces 
that are both diffuse and gray may be viewed conceptually as black surfaces for 
which the emissivity and absorptivity are less than unity.

9.5 Spacecraft Thermal Modeling and Analysis

9.5.1 Lumped-Mass Approximation

For accurate thermal analysis of a spacecraft, it is necessary to construct an
analytical thermal model of the spacecraft. In the simplest case, this will take the
form of a so-called lumped-mass model, where each node represents a thermal

|
|
THERMAL CONTROL 459 
mass connected to other nodes by thermal resistances. This requires identificatiod 
of heat sources and sinks, both external and internal, such as electronics 
packages, heaters, cooling devices, and radiators. Nodes are then defined, usually 
as the major items of structure, tanks, and electronic units. The thermal resistance 
between each pair of thermally connected nodes must be determined. This will 
involve modeling the conductive, radiative, and perhaps convective links 
between nodes. This in turn requires modeling the conductivity of the various 
materials and joints, as well as the emissivity and absorptivity of the surfaces. 
The analogy to lumped-mass structural models, introduced in Chapter 8, with 
mass element nodes connected by springs and dashpots, should be clear. Once 
constructed, the model can be used to solve steady-state problems; we will 
shortly illustrate with an example. 
Often the model proceeds in an evolutionary manner, with the nodes initially 
being relatively few and large and the thermal resistances having broad tolerance. 
At this stage the model may be amenable to hand-calculator analysis or the use of 
simple codes for quick estimates. As the design of the spacecraft matures, the . 
model will become more complex and detailed, requiring computer analysis. No 
matter how detailed the analysis becomes, however, a thermal vacuum test of a 
thermal mock-up or prototype will almost certainly be required, since the model 
requires a host of assumptions unverifiable by any other means. Also, as 
previously observed, the influence of the atmosphere as a convective medium and 
a conductor in joints renders thermal testing in atmosphere problematic. It is 
usually desirable to do an abbreviated test on flight units as well as a final 
verification. The following example demonstrates-in very basic terms-this 
approach to steady-state thermal modeling. 
Example 9.1 
Consider the insulated wall of a vertically standing launch vehicle liquid oxygen 
(LOX) tank, illustrated schematically in Fig. 9.6. The LOX is maintained at a 
tdmperature of 90 K in the tank by allowing it to boil off as necessary to 
accommodate the input heat flux; it is replaced until shortly before launch by a 
propellant feed line at the pad. It is desired to estimate propellant top-off 
requirements, for which the key determining factor is the heat flux into the tank. 
The tank is composed of an aluminum wall of Ad = 5 mm thickness and an 
outer layer of cork with A,, = 3 mm. The ground and outside air temperatures 
are both approximately 300 K, and the sky is overcast with high relative 
humidity. The booster tank diameter of 8 ft is sufficient to render wall curvature 
effects negligible, and its length is enough to allow end effects to be ignored. 
What is the steady-state heat flux into the LOX tank? 
Solution. The statement of the problem allows us to conclude that radiation

mass connected to other nodes by thermal resistances. This requires identificatiotl
of heat sources and sinks, both external and internal, such as electronics
packages, heaters, cooling devices, and radiators. Nodes are then defined, usually
as the major items of structure, tanks, and electronic units. The thermal resistance
between each pair of thermally connected nodes must be determined. This will
involve modeling the conductive, radiative, and perhaps convective links
between nodes. This in turn requires modeling the conductivity of the various
materials and joints, as well as the emissivity and absorptivity of the surfaces.
The analogy to lumped-mass structural models, introduced in Chapter 8, with
mass element nodes connected by springs and dashpots, should be clear. Once
constructed, the model can be used to solve steady-state problems; we will
shortly illustrate with an example. .

Often the model proceeds in an evolutionary manner, with the nodes initially
being relatively few and large and the thermal resistances having broad tolerance.
At this stage the model may be amenable to hand-calculator analysis or the use of
simple codes for quick estimates. As the design of the spacecraft matures, the
model will become more complex and detailed, requiring computer analysis. No
matter how detailed the analysis becomes, however, a thermal vacuum test of a
thermal mock-up or prototype will almost certainly be required, since the model
requires a host of assumptions unverifiable by any other means. Also, as
previously observed, the influence of the atmosphere as a convective medium and
a conductor in joints renders thermal testing in atmosphere problematic. It is
usually desirable to do an abbreviated test on flight units as well as a final
verification. The following example demonstrates—in very basic terms—this
approach to steady-state thermal modeling.

Example 9.1

Consider the insulated wall of a vertically standing launch vehicle liquid oxygen
(LOX) tank, illustrated schematically in Fig. 9.6. The LOX is maintained at a
temperature of 90K in the tank by allowing it to boil off as necessary to
accommodate the input heat flux; it is replaced until shortly before launch by a
propellant feed line at the pad. It is desired to estimate propellant top-off
requirements, for which the key determining factor is the heat flux into the tank.

The tank is composed of an aluminum wall of A,; = 5 mm thickness and an
outer layer of cork with A,, = 3 mm. The ground and outside air temperatures
are both approximately 300K, and the sky is overcast with high relative
humidity. The booster tank diameter of 8 ft is sufficient to render wall curvature
effects negligible, and its length is enough to allow end effects to be ignored.
What is the steady-state heat flux into the LOX tank?

Solution. The statement of the problem allows us to conclude that radiation

free convection into and the conduction through the booster wall. The heat flux is 
unknown, but we know it must in the steady state be the same at all interfaces.

One of the most important preliminary tasks that can be performed in a 
spacecraft program is to obtain a basic understanding of the global spacecraft 
energy balance. 
Figure 9.7 shows a generic spacecraft in Earth orbit and defines the sources 
and sinks of thermal energy relevant to such a spacecraft. Not all features of Fig. 
9.7 are appropriate in every case. Obviously, for a spacecraft not near a planet, the 
planet-related terms are zero. Similarly, in eclipse, the solar and reflected energy 
terms are absent. In orbit about 3 hot, dark planet such as Mercury, reflected 
energy will be small compared to radiated energy from the planet, whereas at 
Venus the opposite may be true. Solar energy input of course varies inversely 
with the square of the distance from the sun and can be essentially negligible for 
outer-planetary missions. These variations in the major input will 
have significant impact upon the thermal control design of the spacecraft. 
The energy balance for the situation depicted in Fig. 9.7 may be written as 
where we have neglected reflected energy contributions other than those from 
Earth to the spacecraft. This renders the enclosure analysis tractable. In effect, we 
have a three-surface problem (Earthl sun, and spacecraft) where, by neglecting 
certain energy transfer paths, a closed-form solution can be achieved. We define

be expected that the thermal system be capable of handling a heat load of up to 
50% greater than analytically predicted. This allows substantial change in the 
spacecraft design without having an inevitably adverse effect on the thermal 
control system. Because such changes rarely are in a favorable direction, an 
initially comfortable 50% margin will decrease as launch is approached, at which 
point a 20% margin may well be deemed adequate.

Problems

9.1 It is desired to place a satellite in an elliptic orbit with a 1000-km apogee
and a very low perigee, to allow the upper atmosphere to be sampled and
thus help to establish its characteristics. Ample propellant for drag make-
up over the planned lifetime of the spacecraft is included, and so the
limiting perigee will be governed by thermal considerations. It is desired
to limit the thermal input from aerodynamic heating to 10% of the solar
illumination of 1400 W/m2. Using the result for heat transfer due to free
molecular flow given in Chapter 6, and the standard atmosphere model of
Chapter 3, what is the lowest altitude at which a satellite perigee can be
allowed?

Power Systems 
10.1 Introduction 
Constraints on available spacecraft power have imposed major limitations on 
space vehicle design since the beginning of the space age. The earliest orbiting 
vehicles flown by both the United States and Russia depended on batteries. The 
limited energy storage capabilities of the batteries then available prevented 
operations of more than a few days. This was not satisfactory for missions of the 
duration required for detailed scientific observations or military reconnaissance, 
and solar power arrays quickly appeared on the scene. Although not highly 
efficient in turning sunlight into electricity, solar arrays (or solar panels) were in 
many ways admirably suited to powering spacecraft. Because no consumables 
were used in generating electrical power, the life expectancy of the power system 
was limited only by degradation of the components of which it was composed. 
Spacecraft operating lifetimes of several years became feasible with the 
development of these photoelectric arrays, with batteries used to handle peak load 
requirements and to provide energy storage for those periods when the spacecraft 
was in eclipse. 
Solar panels and batteries in combination have powered the majority of 
unmanned spacecraft so far launched. Exceptions include a few short-lived 
battery-powered systems, some outer-planet missions using radioisotope 
thermoelectric generators (RTGs), and some spacecraft (mostly Russian radar 
imaging satellites) powered by nuclear reactors. Early manned spacecraft, 
including Mercury, some 'Gemini spacecraft, and the Russian Vostok/Voshkod 
vehicles (which were essentially the same design) used batteries. The later

10.1. Introduction

Constraints on available spacecraft power have imposed major limitations on
space vehicle design since the beginning of the space age. The earliest orbiting
vehicles flown by both the United States and Russia depended on batteries. The
limited energy storage capabilities of the batteries then available prevented
operations of more than a few days. This was not satisfactory for missions of the
duration required for detailed scientific observations or military reconnaissance,
and solar power arrays quickly appeared on the scene. Although not highly
efficient in turning sunlight into electricity, solar arrays (or solar panels) were in
many ways admirably suited to powering spacecraft. Because no consumables
were used in generating electrical power, the life expectancy of the power system
was limited only by degradation of the components of which it was composed.
Spacecraft operating lifetimes of several years became feasible with the
development of these photoelectric arrays, with batteries used to handle peak load
requirements and to provide energy storage for those periods when the spacecraft
was in eclipse.

Solar panels and batteries in combination have powered the majority of
unmanned spacecraft so far launched. Exceptions include a few short-lived
battery-powered systems, some outer-planet missions using radioisotope
thermoelectric generators (RTGs), and some spacecraft (mostly Russian radar
imaging satellites) powered by nuclear reactors. Early manned spacecraft,
including Mercury, some Gemini spacecraft, and the Russian Vostok /Voshkod
vehicles (which were essentially the same design) used batteries. The later
Gemini spacecraft and the Apollo command and’ service module (CSM) and
Lunar Module (LM) used hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells, as does the space shuttle,
while the Russian Soyuz employs solar cells and batteries in a fashion similar to a
typical unmanned spacecraft. The space stations so far built, including Salyut,
Skylab, Mir, and the International Space Station, have all used solar arrays for
prime power generation, with batteries for loadleveling and eclipse periods.

Solar power systems are unsatisfactory for missions beyond the asteroid belt,
where the sun’s energy becomes unacceptably diffuse. As interest developed in
outer-planet missions, a new power source was required. At the same time,
certain military spacecraft missions required a sturdy compact power source.
Both requirements were met by the development of RTGs. These devices convert

469

470 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
the heat energy producdd by radioisotope decay into electricity via the 
thermoelectric effect. Power output is independent of the sun, and lifetime is 
limited only by component degradation and the half-life of the radioisotope. 
RTGs are also useful for operations on planetary surfaces where extended dark 
periods may be encountered. Thus, outer solar system spacecraft such as Pioneer, 
Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini, as well as the Viking Mars Landers and the Apollo 
Lunar Surface Experiment Packages have all been RTG powered, as have some 
Earth orbiting spacecraft. 
Nuclear reactor systems offer very high power in a compact package for quite 
a long duration and tend to be highly independent of the external environment. 
After an extensive development program in the 1960s, all U.S. space reactor 
work, for both power and propulsion, was terminated as a result of space program 
funding reductions in the early 1970s. Only recently has there been a revival of 
interest in power plants of this type. Although Russia continues to fly relatively 
short-lived reactor power systems on an operational basis, the United States has 
flown only a single reactor test mission, the SNAP-IOA in 1972. The joint DoD/ 
NASA/DoE SP-100 project of the mid-to-late 1980s was intended to remedy this 
matter; however, the program was delayed and eventually canceled because of its 
high cost and limited mission applicability. As this is written, interest in nuclear- 
powered systems has again arisen, because they are the only practical means of 
generating relatively high power for long periods in the absence of adequate 
sunlight. 
As can be seen, the power system is a major driver in any spacecraft design 
and is in turn strongly driven by a variety of mission, system, Ad subsystem 
considerations. It interfaces directly with almost every other subsystem and, 
as a result, requires considerable attention from the systems engineer. Power 
system technology continues to evolve, especially in the application of 
automation to routine functions (e.g., battery reconditioning, to be discussed), 
and the development of more efficient power conditioning and control circuitry. 
10.2 Power System Functions 
The obvious functions of a spacecraft power system are to generate and store 
electric power for use by the other spacecraft subsystems. Other subsystems may 
have various specific requirements for voltage, frequency, stability, noise limits, 
or other characteristics, and the power system may be called upon to supply them. 
A significant system-level tradeoff underlies the decision as to whether to require 
the power system to meet these various individual requirements, or to supply all 
subsystems with the same basic power and let each subsystem meet its specific 
power conditioning requirements. For example, a requirement for a very high 
voltage in a particular scientific instrument might be supplied by the spacecraft 
power system, or by a dedicated high-voltage supply within the instrument that

limited only by component degradation and the half-life of the radioisotope.

and is in tum strongly driven by a variety of mission, system, and subsystem
considerations. It interfaces directly with almost every other subsystem and,
as a result, requires considerable attention from the systems engineer. Power
system technology continues to evolve, especially in the application of
automation to routine functions (e.g., battery reconditioning, to be discussed),
and the development of more efficient power conditioning and control circuitry.

10.2 Power System Functions

The obvious functions of a spacecraft power system are to generate and store
electric power for use by the other spacecraft subsystems. Other subsystems may
have various specific requirements for voltage, frequency, stability, noise limits,
or other characteristics, and the power system may be called upon to supply them.
A Significant system-level tradeoff underlies the decision as to whether to require
the power system to meet these various individual requirements, or to supply all
subsystems with the same basic power and let each subsystem meet its specific
power conditioning requirements. For example, a requirement for a very high
voltage in a particular scientific instrument might be supplied by the spacecraft
power system, or by a dedicated high-voltage supply within the instrument that

POWER SYSTEMS 471 
operates off the basic power bus. Similar tradeoffs exist for special cleanliness 
requirements (e.g., absence of ripple on a dc line, ac harmonic suppression, etc.). 
Regardless of the conclusion of these tradeoffs, the power system must 
control, condition, and process the raw power received from the primary source 
to comply with the needs of the spacecraft system. The system must supply 
stable, uninterrupted power for the design life of the system. Failures in many 
other subsystems can be tolerated, with solutions often found through operational 
compromises. However, if the power system does not work essentially as 
planned, the mission is lost. 
To maintain the long-term reliability of the system, the power system must 
provide protection to other subsystems against reasonably likely failures either 
external to or within the power system itself. For example, no short circuit in 
another subsystem should be allowed to drag the main bus voltage down to the 
point of inducingfailure elsewhere in the spacecraft. Similarly, failure protection 
should be implemented in the power system itself to allow for continued 
functioning of the system (perhaps in a degraded mode) following some degree of 
malfunction. 
In the course of normal operation, the power system must accept commands 
from onboard and external sources and provide telemetry data to allow 
monitoring of its operation and general health. 
Finally, it may be necessary to meet highly specialized power requirements for 
particular functions such as firing ordnance. 
10.3 Bower System Evolution 
The evolution of spacecraft power systems has been characterized by growth 
from subsystems delivering a few watts to those delivering tens of kilowatts or 
more. The International Space Station required about 75 kWe initially with 
growth currently planned to 220 kWe or more. Line losses and other efficiency 
factors, including the desire to minimize the mass of spacecraft wire harnesses, 
have resulted in a trend toward higher voltages as power demands have increased. 
Figure 10.1 illustrates this trend and projects broadly what may be anticipated in 
the near future. 
The design lifetime of space systems tends to increase along with required 
power levels as spacecraft become more complex and expensive. As the power 
level and lifetime change, the choice of a primary power source may change as 
well. Figure 10.2 illustrates the general operating regimes of various types of 
power sources. There is a substantial overlap between the regimes, and various 
other considerations may dictate use of some power source at a location in the 
power vs endurance space that may not otherwise appear to be optimum. Figure 
10.2 provides a basis for preliminary concept design in regard to power source 
choices.

10.6 Design Practice

Although details of design practice will vary from one organization to another,
some broadly applicable rules can be articulated. These are discussed in this
section.

10.6.1 Direct Current Switching

As a general rule, switches or relays should be in the positive line to a given
element, with a direct connection to “ground” on the negative side. The purpose

of this design practice is of course to allow power to be shut off in the event of a 
short circuit or other high-current flow failure within the element. 
In a famous manned spaceflight emergency, the Gemini 8 mission was aborted 
less than a day into a planned three-day mission, following loss of flight control 
caused by a roll thruster stuck in the "on" position. Post-flight inspection of the 
spacecraft revealed a small solder ball shorting the thruster (which was switched 
in the negative, or return, line and thus was electrically "hot") to spacecraft 
ground, rendering the astronauts' hand controller inoperative with respect to that 
thruster. 
Not surprisingly, astronauts Neil Annstrong and David Scott were unable to 
diagnose the problem while trying to cope with roll rates of up to 300 deg/s. 
Control could only be regained by shutting down the entire system and reverting 
'to the backup reentry flight control system, after which individual reactivation of 
the primary thrusters, one by one, revealed the culprit. Disabling this thruster 
effectively solved the problem. However, according to the mission rules then in 
force, activation of the reentry flight control system required a mandatory abort, 
resulting in the loss of numerous mission goals.' Subsequent vehicles were 
rewired to have the thrusters switched in the positive control line, so that the 
thruster body was electrically inert when not firing. 
10.6.2 Arc Suppression 
To maximize effectiveness, arc suppression devices should be located as close 
to the source of the arc as possible. As discussed in Chapter 3 in connection with 
spacecraft charging, conductive cables, connectors, solar array edges, and other 
current-carrying elements on LEO spacecraft should not be exposed to the 
ambient plasma, particularly if the spacecraft operates at a bus voltage 
comparable to the arcing threshold of the conductor materials. High altitude ' 
spacecraft should be designed to ensure conductive paths between all spacecraft 
elements to preclude differential charging of isolated sections and subsequent 
arcing between them. 
110.6.3 Modularity 
Modular construction is desirable to simplify testing and to expedite 
replacement of failed or suspect units during system test or launch preparation. 
Spacecraft designers learned early, and at their peril, that the necessity to 
disassemble or remove several non-offending units to achieve access to a suspect 
system often resulted in "collateral damage" to the innocent parties, not to 
mention an excessive workload for numerous technicians. It was realized that the 
savings in mass and volume were more than offset by the delays and reductions in 
reliability caused by excessive "stacking" of components and subsystems. Thus, 
modem space systems design favors considerations of access and maintainability 
as well as conservation of mass and volume.

Spacecraft grounding practices are often the subject of considerable debate 
among practitioners. This text presumes no single approach to spacecraft 
grounding practice. Many successful satellite and spacecraft programs have used 
a variety of grounding techniques of varying levels of complexity. However, 
some design principles are widely accepted? and we advocate those here. 
Use of a common ground cable is generally preferable to individually 
grounding various components and circuit elements to the structure, because it is 
difficult to maintain high continuity between isolated structural elements. When 
such difficulty occurs, electrical resistance results between various parts of the 
spacecraft ground structure that are intended to be at a common potential i.e., to 
have no electrical resistance between them. Thus, different portions of the 
electrical system, intended to be at the same electrical potential above the 
common ground, will not be so, and may therefore not function as intended. 
As a simple example, a semiconductor switch may be designed to "trip" upon 
application of a 5-V potential, but not at a 3-V potential difference to avoid 
spurious switching due to electrical noise on the line. If there is enough electrical 
resistance in the ground loop to generate a 2-V drop on the return line, the switch 
can never be activated. While this may seem to be an extreme example, a voltage 
drop of this magnitude can easily occur across a long ground loop such as might 
be found on a large spacecraft. Numerous examples, some of direct experience to 
the present authors, occurred during early shuttle operations, when experience 
with large payloads remotely mounted in a cargo bay aboard an even larger 
vehicle was then minimal. 
For these reasons, such "ground loops" are obviously to be avoided whenever 
possible. This gives rise to the practice of providing a common, low-resistance 
grounding strap or cable to all subsystems throughout the spacecraft, which is 
then carefully grounded at a single point to the spacecraft structure. Any ground 
circuit current flow is less likely to disturb sensitive components if confined to a 
properly isolated and connected ground cable. When electrical noise is thought to 
bea problem for certain circuits or instruments, as is often the case, noisy power- 
switching ground lines will often be kept separate from "signal" ground lines, 
prior to structural grounding. For similar reasons, radio-frequency (RF) 
grounding requirements may be incompatible with the needs of other systems, 
except again for the general requirement to be ultimately tied back to the primary 
structure. 
On some occasions it may be necessary to isolate completely a given 
instrument or subsystem from other sources of spacecraft electrical noise. When 
this is the case, some portions of the vehicle will be electrically isolated, or 
"floated," with respect to others. Provided that it is intentional, this practice is 
acceptable. However, it is then necessary to take care to ensure that the separately 
floated ground does not inadvertently contact the "common" ground, because 
current would then flow between them.

10.6.4 Grounding

grounding practice. Many successful satellite and spacecraft programs have used

478 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
It is sometimes very awkward, if not impossible, to provide a single-point 
common structural ground to subsystems in all portions of a large or complex 
space vehicle. When a single-point ground is difficult to achieve, but a common 
ground plane remains necessary, a multipoint grounding architecture will be 
1 employed. Several different grounding points to the structure are provided, with I 
i every effort made to maintain very low resistance paths between them. 
Nonetheless, the single-point ground generally remains the design objective to be I 
achieved. 
10.6.5 Continuity 
Good continuity should be maintained between structural elements, thermal 
blankets, etc., to minimize the probability of buildup of static electrical potential 
or other voltage differences. 
10.6.6 Shield Continuity 
Shield continuity must be maintained across all connections. A single-point 
shield ground is desirable to minimize the possibility of shield current flow. Most 
circuits, especially noise-sensitive or noise-generating circuits, will be shielded, 
with the shields sharing a common ground if possible, as previously discussed. 
10.6.7 Complexity 
In keeping with good general engineering practice, the spacecraft power 
system should be no more complex than is necessary to do the job. Excessive, 
unnecessary complication will increase design, fabrication, and test costs and 
increase the probability of failure. It is for exactly this reason that the choice is 
often made to offer a relatively simple menu of power supply bus voltages to the 
various spacecraft subsystems, and to allow each of them to deal separately with 
any special requirements. Such a solution is rarely the least massive, and never 
the most electrically efficient, but it usually offers gains in simplicity that should 
be ignored only when no reasonable alternative exists. 
Particular circumstances may force a violation of any of the previously 
mentioned rules to meet some overriding requirement. In the absence of such a 
requirement, however, adherence to these rules is very much recommended and 
will generally have a desirable impact on the overall operation.

Batteries have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future the

here to enhance understanding of the material to follow:

measured in ampere hours (e.g., 40A for 
1 h = 40 Ah).

cycle life). 
Charge rate, Rchg Rate at which the battery can accept charge 
(measured in amperes per unit time). 
Energy density, eb,, Energy per unit mass [J/kg or (W . h)/kg] stored 
in the battery. 
A battery (strictly speaking, an individual cell of a battery) is a device that 
converts chemical energy directly to electrical energy. A single cell has a 
negative electrode, a conductive electrolyte, and a positive electrode. The 
electrolyte may be in liquid, paste, or solid form; potassium hydroxide (KOH) is a 
common choice. If the cell is connected to an external electrical load, electrons 
flow from the negative electrode, throQgh the load, and back to the positive 
electrode. The chemical reaction essentially ceases when the load is removed; 
however, it should be noted that the battery will slowly degrade chemically over 
time, whether used or not. Thus, most batteries have a "shelf life" within which 
they must be used. 
Batteries are divided into two major categories: primary and secondary. The 
former offer higher energy and power densities for a'given battery chemistry but 
are by definition not rechargeable. This definition is sometimes stretched to 
include as primary batteries those which are rechargeable for only a few cycles.

10.7.1 Primary Batteries

In cases where extremely long installed storage is required, e.g., a missile in its
silo or a planetary atmosphere probe that is inert during interplanetary transfer,
the battery is often dry (i.e., without electrolyte) prior to activation. Upon
activation, a pyrotechnic valve fires to allow the electrolyte to enter the battery

1 from a separate reservoir. This approach provides a highly reliable quick-reaction 
power source that is nevertheless protected from degradation and requires no 
maintenance during extended storage. Another quick-reaction, dry storage 
battery is the thermal battery. In this case, the electrolyte is solid at normal 
temperature. Ignition of a chemical heater, which melts the electrolyte and results 
in a fully charged battery, activates the battery. The battery stays active as long as 
the electrolyte is molten or until it is fully discharged. 
A major application of these types of batteries in long-life space systems is to 
supply power to activate pyrotechnic charges and other deployment devices. 
Such devices typically are operated at the beginning of the mission or for 
relatively brief periods during a longer mission.   not her application is to short- 
duration, high power-drain devices such as electromechanical actuators. For a 
variety of reasons, such as minimizing power drain or isolating noisy circuits 
from the main power bus, it may be desirable to operate these circuits from a 
primary battery that is completely isolated from the main power system. 
During the early years of space systems development, the most common type 
of primary battery was the' silver-zinc battery, usually abbreviated Ag-Zn. This 
battery has excellent energy density and is still the battery of choice in many 
cases. In recent years a variety of batteries based on lithium in combination with 
various other materials have come on the scene. Some of these batteries offer the 
highest energy density currently available. Certain types of lithium batteries 
experienced significant "teething problems" in early applications, showing a 
distressing tendency to explode in some situations. Leakage and corrosion 
problems have also been encountered. However, these problems have largely 
yielded to better understanding of battery characteristics and ensuing engineering 
development, and lithium batteries can: today be reliably employed in many space 
vehicle applications. 
10.7.2 Secondary Batteries 
The rechargeable or secondary battery generally has a much lower energy 
density, which is further aggravated by limitations on the depth of discharge. 
Again, silver-zinc batteries were the most commonly used for a number of years 
and have demonstrated good energy density (which is nonetheless reduced as 
compared to the primary form of these batteries, due to the extra wrapping 
material used to isolate each cell in the battery when it is intended to be 
recharged). However, these batteries suffer from life limitations, especially in 
applications involving a large number of charge/discharge cycles. As a result, 
nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd, or nicad) batteries have been for many years very nearly 
the standard for spacecraft applications. Certainly they have been the most 
common in LEO spacecraft designs. 
A more recent development in battery technology is the nickel-hydrogen (Ni- 
Hz) design. This battery differs from other types in that a large amount of free 
hydrogen is generated as part of a charge/discharge cycle. As a result, quite high

from a separate reservoir. This approach provides a highly reliable quick-reaction
power source that is nevertheless protected from degradation and requires no
maintenance during extended storage. Another quick-reaction, dry storage
battery is the thermal battery. In this case, the electrolyte is solid at normal
temperature. Ignition of a chemical heater, which melts the electrolyte and results
in a fully charged battery, activates the battery. The battery stays active as long as
the electrolyte is molten or until it is fully discharged.

supply power to activate pyrotechnic charges and other deployment devices.

relatively brief periods during a longer mission. Another application is to short-

A more recent development in battery technology is the nickel-hydrogen (Ni-
Hy) design. This battery differs from other types in that a large amount of free
hydrogen is generated as part of a charge/discharge cycle. As a result, quite high

POWER SYSTEMS 481 
pressures are generated and the battery case is, in fact, a pressure vessel. 
(Actually, other battery types, such as Ni-Cd, do generate some pressure and 
require a reasonably strong case to contain it. However, Ni-H2 battery pressure 
exceeds that of nicads by a factor of 10.) Ni-H2 batteries are capable of greater 
depth of discharge than nicads and, even with the penalty of the high pressure 
case, offer better energy density. Ni-H2 batteries do not require reconditioning. In 
large part because of this advantage, Ni-Hz batteries have been very competitive 
in recent years with nicads, particularly for GEO spacecraft, and as this is written 
may even be used in the majority of new spacecraft. 
The pressure vessel cases of Ni-H2 batteries are generally cylindrical with 
hemispherical ends. This makes close packing difficult. In an effort to avoid the 
pressure containment problem while retaining the other advantages of nickel- 
hydrogen systems, the nickel-metal hydride battery (Ni-MH) was developed. 
This battery depends on the ability of some metallic hydrides to contain large 
amounts of hydrogen in the structure at low pressure. This allows the battery cell 
case to be rectangular like most other batteries, allowing for more efficient 
packing. Ni-MH batteries are in very common commercial use in cell phones, 
laptop computers, etc. Unfortunately, space applications of Ni-MH batteries have 
been few, primarily because of the limited cycle life so far demonstrated for this 
technology. 
Lithium-based secondary batteries are also available and offer excellent 
energy density. Some of the chemistries available do require reconditioning. 
Table 10.3 provides a list of various battery types and the characteristics of each. 
As noted earlier, the battery average discharge voltage V,,, is the product of 
the individual cell average discharge voltage and the number of cells in series. As 
seen in Table 10.3, the'cell voltage of most of the battery chemistries discussed 
here is approximately 1.25-1 .SO V. All batteries will have a higher discharge 
voltage when fully charged than when nearly depleted. Indeed, the drop in output 
voltage below a specified threshold is the indication that it is time to recharge the 
battery. A nicad cell might have an average discharge voltage of 1.25 V, with a 
charging cycle mandated should the voltage drop below 1.1 V. 
Most spacecraft systems flown to date by the United States have used 28 VDC 
as the nominal bus voltage; thus, most associated battery hardware has also been 
designed for 28 VDC. This practice reflects the heritage of early spacecraft 
avionics from aircraft systems in terms of electronic component design and 
usage. Generally speaking, this was satisfactory for the relatively small, low- 
power spacecraft flown in earlier decades. However, as larger and more powerful 
systems have become common, higher voltage systems have become more 
attractive. The future will undoubtedly see a continuing trend toward the use of 
higher voltage spacecraft power buses (see Fig. 10.1). This practice reduces the 
current-handling requirements of the spacecraft wire harness and thus the 
attendant weight of that harness. Also, because resistive losses (and heating) are 
proportional to the square of the current being carried, such inefficiencies are also 
minimized by the use of a higher bus voltage.

As noted earlier, the battery average discharge voltage Vy, is the product of
the individual cell average discharge voltage and the number of cells in series. As
seen in Table 10.3, the cell voltage of most of the battery chemistries discussed
here is approximately 1.25-1.50 V. All batteries will have a higher discharge
voltage when fully charged than when nearly depleted. Indeed, the drop in output
voltage below a specified threshold is the indication that it is time to recharge the

proportional to the square of the current being carried, such inefficiencies are also
minimized by the use of a higher bus voltage.

Depth of discharge limitations usually require a tradeoff between battery mass 
due to the unused capacity and battery degradation and lifetime reduction due to 
repeated deep discharge. Spacecraft in low-altitude, low-inclination orbits around 
the Earth or another planet typically experience the most severe usage in terms of 
charge/discharge cycles, because they experience eclipse on each orbit. In LEO a 
spacecraft battery will be discharged and charged some 12- 16 times per day. This 
results in some 10,000 or more cycles in only a few years, yet modem spacecraft 
are normally expected to function for substantially longer periods of time. 
Most battery chemistries so far developed cannot accept so many charge- 
discharge cycles; thus, for such applications, Ni-Cd batteries have been the 
system of choice, despite their low energy density. However, even with nicads, it 
is necessary to limit the depth of discharge to a relatively small amount, 15-2596, 
and to recondition the batteries periodically if the desired total lifetime is to be 
obtained. As experience has grown with Ni-H2 batteries, their advantages in this 
regard have made them the system of choice in many cases, especially for large 
spacecraft. 
Eclipse time in low orbit can be as high as 40% of the orbital period, or on the 
order of 35 min for Earth orbits. Spacecraft in synchronous equatorial 
(geostationary) orbits go for extended periods without encountering eclipse. 
However, CEO spacecraft encounter two eclipse seasons each year, with each 
period being 45 days long. During these periods the spacecraft encounters one 
eclipse each day ranging from momentary duration at the beginning and end of 
the period up to 72 rnin at the midpoint. 
Some spacecraft in near-polar sun-synchronous orbits with the orbit plane 
aligned essentially along the terminator may never be in eclipse; these are often 
called dawn-dusk orbits. The same may be true for deep space vehicles. This does 
not usually mean batteries are not needed, however. It may be necessary to 
maneuver the spacecraft off the sun line to obtain proper thruster pointing for 
course correction. Even if this is not necessary, it may be more efficient to use a 
battery to handle intermittent peak loads rather than to oversize the solar arrays to 
cope with the peak load. Far similar reasons batteries may be required even on 
spacecraft using power sources (such as RTGs) that do not depend on the sun. 
Given the power usage of the spacecraft and the maximum allowable depth of 
discharge (DOD) for the design lifetime of the battery, the battery can be sized by

radiation tolerance, and cost. Figure 10.2 depicts operating ranges that are 
deemed generally suitable for various prime power sources, based on power level 
and lifetime. Such curves are intended to be broadly indicative rather than 
specifically definitive. There is in any case substantial overlap between the

far-term applications, both civil and military. The lifetime required of space ! 
assets has increased as well, a consequence of the large investment to build and 
operate a modern spacecraft and its associated ground equipment. In the case of 
scientific spacecraft, the required operational duration has increased because the 
targets are more distant, or the missions more complex, or both. In any case, life 
expectancy has become an increasingly important factor, especially because most

Environmental factors to be considered include the obvious issue of access to 
adequate solar illumination. If the spacecraft is too far from the sun (and Mars at 
1.5 AU is at roughly the useful outer limit), solar arrays are not a viable choice. 
Concentrators may extend their capability to a limited degree, but eventually the 
inverse-square law renders solar energy simply too diffuse to be useful. Radiation 
resistance is another significant consideration; solar cells are seriously degraded 
by extensive exposure to radiation. This can be a major consideration for a 
spacecraft that must operate extensively in the Van Allen belts or other high- 
radiation environments. 
In subsequent sections, various prime power sources are discussed, 
particularly in terms of the capabilities and limitations of each. Detailed 
technical descriptions of each are beyond the scope of this book, and the

10.9 Solar Arrays 
Regardless of the size of the total array, each array is made up of a very large 
number of individual cells arranged on a substrate of some type. Although each 
cell puts out a relatively small current and voltage, proper series and parallel 
connection can provide any desired current and voltage within reasonable 
physical limitations. Individual cells are made in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
Probably the most common as this is written is the rectangular cell with 
dimensions on the order of 2 x 4 cm; however, cells in common use range from 
2 x 2 cm to 2.5 x 6.2 cm. The rectangular shape allows for reasonably efficient 
packing, enabling array size and mass to be minimized. A well-designed array 
might have a cell packing density of 90%. Because some minimum spacing 
and allowance for connections must be provided, it is difficult to improve 
significantly on this, although innovative techniques may allow some gains to be 
made. 
Because solar arrays can bq quite large for higher power spacecraft, it quickly 
becomes impossible to find adequate area on the fixed spacecraft structure. Early 
low-powered spacecraft did in fact restrict the array area to the spacecraft skin. 
Most designs were drum-shaped spinning spacecraft, where only about 40% of 
the array was illuminated by the sun at any time. As power requirements grew, 
fixed arrays that were'not specifically part of the spacecraft structural shell or skin 
were tried; however, launch vehicle nose fairing dimensions limit the utility of 
such an approach, and deployable solar arrays made an early appearance. Figure 
10.5 depicts a variety of solar array designs. 
Deployable solar arrays have typically been semirigid paddle-like structures 
that are deployed from the main structure after the spacecraft is injected into 
orbit. Keeping the array firmly locked to the spacecraft structure during launch 
allows the use of extremely lightweight structures. Such designs are constrained

concept, and a variety of flexible roll-up and fold-up solar arrays are now in 
routine use. Perhaps the most spectacularly visible example was the 12.5-kW 
array demonstrated on space shuttle mission STS-10. This early demonstration 
led to the deployable arrays presently used on the International Space Station. 
This type of design, along with a large variety of deployable rigid array concepts, 
allows convenient packaging of very large arrays for launch. 
Flexible solar arrays can introduce problems simply because of their 
flexibility. The primary resonant frequency of the roll-up arrays originally used 
on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) allowed an undesirable interaction with 
ihe bandwidth of the attitude control system, causing difficulty in achieving the 
accurate pointing required. On-orbit replacement with stiffer arrays has largely 
corrected the problem. Another problem with very large arrays and the attendant 
high voltage and power levels they produce is the conductor mass and the 
required insulation between circuit elements. This can be particularly trying in 
flexible arrays, and represents one of the practical limits that solar array 
technology may impose on the spacecraft designer. Still, roll-up arrays offer the 
lowest mass approach currently available for providing large array areas. 
To extend the capabilities of solar arrays to regions farther from the sun, 
reflective concentrators of various types have been proposed. Figure 10.6 shows 
two concentrator concepts. The flat concentrator array for use with silicon (Si) 
cells is basically a trough that increases the collection area relative to the cell 
area. This concept is useful at sol:~r distances beyond 1.5 AU by increasing the 
energy available for conversion and keeping the cells from becoming excessively 
cold. Such concentrators can probably extend the useful range of Si cells out to 
3-4 AU and possibly farther. 
The other concentrator concept is particularly directed toward gallium 
arsenide cells. These cells, while coming into more common use, are nonetheless 
quite expensive relative to silicon arrays, and it is therefore desirable to minimize 
cell area. Also, these cells function best at a higher temperature than their silicon 
counterparts. The concept shown concentrates sunlight from a large collection 
area onto a small cell area. This reduces cell cost and brings the cells to a higher 
operating temperature than would otherwise be the case, thus providing a dou6le 
benefit. An obvious disadvantage is that such concentrators are complex and 
expensive to manufacture. Any concentrator, even the relatively simple one 
shown for the conventional silicon array, clearly complicates stowage and 
deployment. 
The highly successful Deep Space 1 technology demonstrator spacecraft used 
an array of Fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight on the solar cells. 
The HS-702 geosynchronous communications spacecraft used a tiough-type 
concentrator for many years. However, problems began to develop, resulting in 
unacceptable power output degradation, and the concentrators were eventually 
eliminated. It appeared that the power loss was due to contamination, and it is

10.9.1 Solar Cell Characteristics

Certain technical characteristics of solar cells, such as temperature
dependence and the current-voltage (J-V) curve, are of interest to the spacecraft
designer.

As with other semiconductor devices, solar cell characteristics are temperature
dependent. The first-order effect for a typical silicon cell operating within its
normal range is a voltage decrease with temperature; the second-order effect is an
increase of current flow with temperature. The effect on current is roughly 10% of
that on voltage, so that the net result is a decrease in output power with
temperature. Figure 10.7 illustrates this behavior; again, as voltage increases,
current drops. The temperature coefficient for voltage, yy, will be in the range of
—2 to —3mV/K, while y,, the temperature coefficient for current, will be
approximately 0.2-0.3 mA/K. The temperature corrections (from reference
conditions) for voltage and current output are of the form

Unless it is important to obtain the highest possible accuracy, it is common to 
ignore the separate variations of voltage and current and use instead a composite 
temperature coefficient for power in an equation of the same form as Eqs. (10.3) 
and (10.4). However, the effect of the voltage increase for cold panels, as with a 
spacecraft exiting an eclipse period, must be considered in the design of the 
power system, because a major power surge can occur under these circumstances. 
The shape of the I-V curve shown in Fig. 10.8 is typical of solar cells and is 
I important in the design of spacecraft power systems. To minimize mass and 
maximize efficiency, it is obviously desirable to operate the array at its maximum 
power point. Because power is the product of current and voltage, .

I selection of the operating point to maximize the area under the I-V curve allows 
I the maximum power point to be found. This is the point at which the maximum 
/ area rectangle that will fit within the I-Vcurve intersects the curve. As can be seen 
in Fig. 10.8, this lies on the knee of the I-V curve. Although some specific 
applications may dictate operation at some other point, the majority of systems 
will be designed for maximum power point operation. With the maximum power 
point for the cells defined, the current and voltage of individual cells is known. 
This information, in conjunction with the voltage and current requirements of the 
spacecraft, defines the series-parallel arrangement of the cells in the array. 
It is common to specify the maximum power operating point, Vmp and I,,, at a 
given temperature, often room temperature, as reference conditions in Eqs. (10.3) 
and (1 0.4), though of course this is not required. For a conventional silicon cell, 
V,, will be 0.4-0.5 V at moderate temperatures. The maximum power operating 
point for current, I,,, depends on the area of the cell for a given illumination 
level. For cell sizes in common use, I,, will be in the range of 30- 120 mA. 
It occasionally results that a transient load or other problem will drive the 
operating point off the knee of the curve and down into the lower voltage range. 
The array may then not be able to return to the normal operating point. Having a 
battery in the system helps to stabilize it against such eventualities. Even systems

and (10.4). However, the effect of the voltage increase for cold panels, as with a
spacecraft exiting an eclipse period, must be considered in the design of the
power system, because a major power surge can occur under these circumstances.

important in the design of spacecraft power systems. To minimize mass and
maximize efficiency, it is obviously desirable to operate the array at its maximum

in Fig. 10.8, this lies on the knee of the /-V curve. Although some specific
applications may dictate operation at some other point, the majority of systems
will be designed for maximum power point operation. With the maximum power
point for the cells defined, the current and voltage of individual cells is known.
This information, in conjunction with the voltage and current requirements of the
spacecraft, defines the series-paralle] arrangement of the cells in the array.

It is common to specify the maximum power operating point, V»p and Imp, at a
given temperature, often room temperature, as reference conditions in Egs. (10.3)
and (10.4), though of course this is not required. For a conventional silicon cell,
Vinp Will be 0.4—0.5 V at moderate temperatures. The maximum power operating
point for current, Jp, depends on the area of the cell for a given illumination
level. For cell sizes in common use, Jp will be in the range of 30-120 mA.

It occasionally results that a transient load or other problem will drive the
operating point off the knee of the curve and down into the lower voltage range.

eclipse) may require a battery for this reason. Off-line batteries or other devices 
that can be switched into the circuit to provide a temporary power boost may also 
be used. The operational alternative, of course, is controlled load-shedding to

general relativity, which remained controversial for several decades.) This leads 
to a family of curves similar to that shown in Fig. 10.9. A similar set could be 
drawn for an array moving toward the sun, with current increasing and voltage 
dropping slightly as solar distance decreases. Regarding Fig. 10.9, it will be noted 
that as a result of these changes the maximum power point moves slightly. This 
should be considered in spacecraft power system design for planetary missions.

maximum power point corresponding to Mars distance from the sun, because that 
is where the demand for power to operate the onboard instruments will be 
greatest, and because'excess power will in any case be available while near the 
Earth. 
10.9.2 Sun Tracking 
It will be obvious that maximum power is available when the sun line is 
normal to the array. As the angle between the sun line and the array normal 
deviates from 0 deg, one expects that a cosine relationship between incidence 
angle and array output would obtain. This is indeed the case for angles up to about 
60 deg. At larger angles, where the sun angle approaches parallel to the array 
face, the cosine relation begins to break down due to the finite thickness of the

deviates from O deg, one expects that a cosine relationship between incidence

Figure 10.10 gives an approximate curve for current vs sun angle. 
Although early spacecraft were often designed with fixed-orientation panels 
(if separate panels were used at all), modem spacecraft are almost universally 
designed to allow sun tracking by the solar array. The required tracking accuracy 
is not particularly challenging, since even a 10-deg error yields a cosine loss 
of only 1.5%. However, it is usually better to minimize sudden attitude 
disturbances, and so typically the solar array will be articulated in small 
increments more or less continuously, rather than in a few large maneuvers. 
To cause a solar panel attached to a spacecraft in a planetary orbit to track the 
sun requires, in general, two angular degrees of freedom @OF). The first degree 
of freedom (often called the a angle) compensates for the apparent rotation of the 
sun vector in the orbit plane, as seen from the spacecraft in orbit. Clearly, a will 
range from 0 to 360 deg over the course of a single orbit, a factor that must be 
considered in making arrangements to transfer power across the rotating interface 
between the solar panel and the spacecraft body. (The power transfer harness 
cannot continue to be wound indefinitely around a fixed axle on the spacecraft.) 
The second degree of freedom, the P angle, is necessary to compensate for the 
component of the sun vector norm:il to the orbit plane. Unless the orbit is sun 
synchronous, the /3 angle will vary more or less slowly throughout the year, as 
determined by the particular orbit parameters (see Chapter 4). 
It is often possible to use the spacecraft itself to supply one of these degrees of 
freedom;-for example, many spacecraft deal with changes in P angle by means of 
body rotation, leaving a single solar array drive gear to cope with a angle 
articulation. However, when'numerous other instruments on a spacecraft must 
also be oriented properly, and when thermal control requirements are taken into 
account, it will in the end often be simpler to use a full 2-DOF separately

Concentrators may still be attractive in some applications to reduce the total

A recent development, which offers the promise of very high efficiency, is the 
multijunction or multilayer solar cell. In this arrangement, the top or outer cell is 
optimized for conversion of light in the visible regime, where the solar output 
peaks. Beneath this top cell lie one or two layers of additional cells. These are 
optimized for energy conversion in the infrared range, thus using some of the 
energy that would ordinarily be radiated to space as waste heat. The conversion 
efficiency of the IR cells is much lower than that of the visible wavelength cells, 
but they nevertheless make a significant contribution. Cells of this type can 
deliver close to 30% conversion efficiency. 
As would be expected, multilayer cells are heavier and more expensive than 
conventional cells. However, the cost penalty is not as great as might be 
imagined, because the additional layers of material are all deposited during a 
single manufacturing sequence in a vacuum chamber.

The radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) is a power source that 
renders the spacecraft independent of the sun. Although this is an advantage 'in 
many cases, it comes at a price that explains why these units have seen only 
limited use. The RTG functions by converting the heat enem generated by decay 
of a radioisotope into direct current electricity by means of the thermoelectric 
effect. In a typical RTG (Fig. 10.13), a central core of radioisotope material is 
surrounded by an array of thermocouples connected in series-parallel to obtain 
the desired voltage and current output. The hot side of the thermocouple junction 
is in contact with the canister containing the radioisotope, and the cold side is in 
contact with the external wall of the RTG, from which heat is radiated to space. 
The efficiency of the RTG is ultimately limited by the conversion efficiency of the 
thermoelectric elements. 
Modern semiconductor thermoelectric devices, such as are used for Galileo 
and Cassini, can deliver a conversion efficiency of 10-1 196, and research 
continues in an effort to improve this. Other limitations involve the internal

units, and the upper and lower limits are driven by material limits on the hot side 
and radiator size (usually) on the cold side, the importance of minimizing 
conductive drops or thermal leakage is obvious. These factors plus internal 
resistance and other losses explain why overall RTG efficiency is typically

electrical energy produced. 
The RTG used for the Galileo Jupiter Orbiter delivers 298 W +_ 10% at the

The RTG used for the Galileo Jupiter Orbiter delivers 298 W + 10% at the

doped silicon-germanium (Si-Ge). The radioisotope material used is plutonium-
238 (°8Pu).

Although all radioisotopes exhibit a loss in energy output with time, the 86.7-

Degradation of the thermoelectric elements, caused mostly by dopant migration
at the relatively high temperatures involved, is a more significant cause of
performance loss. Breakdown of insulators because of temperature and radiation
is also a factor.

Although 7?8Pu has been most commonly used in RTGs, there are other
candidates offering the combination of reasonably long half-life with high energy
output that together qualify an isotope for RTG use. Table 10.4 lists some

candidates. Note that, for long space missions, only strontium-90 (%r) has a 
half-life adequate to be a viable candidate in addition to 238Pu. 
Each radioisotope has a particular form and energy of radiation that is given 
off in the decay process. 238~ gives off an alpha particle and a relatively low- 
energy beta particle, both of which are relatively easy to shield compared with the 
high-energy gamma radiation from 90~r. The long-term effect of RTG radiation 
upon electronics is definitely a factor in radioisotope selection. 
By their nature, RTGs cannot be turned off in the conventional sense. That is, 
the radioisotope continues to decay and to generate heat regardless of any 
external action. Similarly, the thermoelectrics will generate electricity whenever 
a temperature differential exists and a load is placed across the output terminals. 
Because there is no practical way to control the generation of electricity at an 
essentially constant rate within the RTG, control must be external. In spacecraft 
applications control is typically accomplished by use of a shunt regulator to 
dispose of electrical energy in excess of the operational requirements at any given 
time. RTGs are usually stored in a shorted condition. This has the desirable 
characteristic of reducing the temperature of the RTG during storage because of 
the Peltier thermoelectric cooling effect. 
Aside from their high cost, particularly for the radioisotope, RTGs have a 
variety of problems that have limited their use when other power sources will 
suffice. The high external temperature and the radiation from the radioisotope are 
a major problem in ground handling. Special equipment is required because the 
assembly crew cannot directly handle the units without thermal protection (e.g., 
heavy gloves). This complicates structural assembly and the making of electrical 
connections and significantly increases installation time. This in turn is 
problematic because it increases the exposure of the crew to radiation from the 
radioisotope. Such radiation can be of sufficient intensity to mandate the use of 
oversize work crews so that no individual exceeds allowable dose limits. It is also 
important to allow for contingencies. If the crew is sized to reach the exposure 
limit in the course of a normal installation, then there will be no one available in 
the event of a problem requiring the RTGs to be removed and reinstalled. 
A further problem is the possibility of Earth contamination by the radioisotope 
in the event of a launch failure or decay from orbit. The radioisotopes in RTGs 
launched to date have been extensively protected against both destruction in the 
event of a launch failure and incineration upon reentry. The fuel itself is normally

important to allow for contingencics. If the crew is sized to reach the exposure
limit in the course of a normal installation, then there will be no one available in
the event of a problem requiring the RTGs to be removed and reinstalled.

A further problem is the possibility of Earth contamination by the radioisotope
in the event of a launch failure or decay from orbit. The radioisotopes in RTGs
launched to date have been extensively protected against both destruction in the
event of a launch failure and incineration upon reentry. The fuel itself is normally
500 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
the oxide of the radioisotope and is therefore reasonably strong and resistant to 
high temperature by itself. The lumps of oxide are then encased in graphite for 
atmospheric entry and impact protection. Extensive tests are performed to qualify 
the fuel elements for this environment, with notable success. The aborted Apollo 
13 lunar landing mission eventually resulted in reentry of the RTG fuel element at 
lunar return velocity, followed by impact in the Pacific Ocean. There has been no 
subsequent evidence of any release of radioisotope material from this event. 
Similarly, most reasonable launch failure scenarios can be accommodated by 
the internal protection built into the RTGs. It is possible, however, to postulate a 
launch failure of such severity that the fuel elements will be shattered and the 
radioactive material scattered into the atmosphere. This may be technically (if not 
politically) acceptable provided the material is thoroughly dispersed in the upper 
atmosphere in the form of very fine particles, so that the concentration at any 
point on the surface will be very low when the material settles out of the 
atmosphere. 
It must be noted that an accident of this magnitude would represent a very 
improbable launch failure scenario, most of which are rather benign as explosive 
events are judged (i.e., they are deflagration as opposed to detonation events). For 
example, analysis indicates that the 1986 Challenger accident would not have 
created a hazard due to radioisotope dispersal had RTGs been aboard. In another 
noteworthy case, the launch abort and subsequent destruction of a military 
payload carrying an RTG was followed by recovery of the intact RTG from the 
water off Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The unit was reused on a 
subsequent mission. 
These examples aside, it remains necessary to plan for the worst possible case. 
Extensive analysis is necessary to determine the possible hazard environment and 
to devise protection adequate to ensure that the radioactive material comes down 
in a condition that minimizes dispersion and allows for recovery. This is 
especially of concern for plutonium, which, besides being radioactive, is 
extremely toxic. 
The radiation from RTGs is detrimental to spacecraft electronics and 
instruments, making it necessary td mount the units on booms at some distance 
from the body of the spacecraft, and often to provide shielding as well. It must be 
noted that the spacecraft configuration as stowed for launch will not allow the 
RTG boom to be in its deployed configuration. Therefore, the spacecraft must be 
able to survive whatever radiation exposure will accrue during the stowed period 
by means of shielding and the inherent radiation tolerance of the onboard 
electronics.

10.11 Fuel Cells

Fuel cells are devices that allow direct conversion of chemical energy into
electricity. In this they are like batteries, with the difference that fuel cells operate

POWER SYSTEMS 501 
much more efficiently. An oxidizer and a fuel are fed into the cell, which is 
roughly similar to a battery in its internal arrangement. Electricity is generated 
directly from the oxidation reaction within the cell, aided by the presence of a 
catalytic material, but without the high temperature and other complications 
associated with combustion. Space applications of fuel cells have been primarily 
to manned spaceflight, and were first used to power the later Gemini spacecraft as 
well as the Apollo CSM, the lunar module, and the space shuttle. 
Although numerous fuel-oxidizer combinations are possible and have been 
used experimentally, only hydrogen and oxygen have so far been used as 
reactants in operational fuel cells for space applications. The output of the cells i's 
essentially pure water, which is used for crew consumption with little or no 
treatment. Laboratory demonstrations have shown conversion efficiencies 
approaching 35%. 
The overall mass of a fuel cell system is a function of the desired operating 
time, since the mass of the reactant must be included in the assessment. For a 
system of fixed mass, however, an energy density of 500 (W . h)/kg at a power 
level of 2.6 kW is a reasonable figure of merit. Lacking a substantial industrial 
production base, fuel cells remain a costly source of power, in the range of 
$3000/kW for commercial systems (essentially the same as for rechargeable 
batteries) and much higher for space-qualified systems. 
Fuel cell development is in many ways still in its infancy. Fuel cells run most 
efficiently on pure hydrogen and oxygen, but because of the difficulty of storing 
and handling liquid hydrogen relative to most other fluids, there has been 
considerable interest in the use of other sources of hydrogen for commercial 
devices. Commercial fuel cell development has focused on the use of methane, 
methanol, ethanol, natural gas, and other sources rich in hydrogen. Catalytic 
conversion is necessary to render the hydrogen free for use in the fuel cell, and 
carbon-based impurities interfere with the desired operation of the cell. These 
factors have hindered the development of commercially viable production fuel 
cell technology. 
A variant concept, the so-called direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), offers the 
possibility of very small fuel cell power packs for portable applications and could 
be of great interest as a source of power for space suits and other applications 
where high energy density and small size are required. Although not as efficient 
as its larger brethren, the DMFC offers energy density of at least twice that of its 
lithium-battery competitors and can be "recharged" simply by adding methanol. 
The first use of DMFC power packs will undoubtedly be in commercial laptop 
computers, cellphones, and other consumer electronics devices. However, there 
is nothing in their nature that precludes use in space, and such applications can be 
expected to follow. 
A tantalizing possibility for energy storage in large systems, such as the 
International Space Station, is to use regenerative fuel cells in lieu of batteries. In 
this scenario, fuel cells would use stored hydrogen and oxygen to generate 
electricity during eclipse periods. During the illuminated portion of the orbit,

A tantalizing possibility for energy storage in large systems, such as the
International Space Station, is to use regenerative fuel cells in lieu of batteries. In
this scenario, fuel cells would use stored hydrogen and oxygen to generate
electricity during eclipse periods. During the illuminated portion of the orbit,

502 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
solar arrays would generate electricity to power the spacecraft and to recharge the 
fuel cells by electrolyzing the water generated during operation. The resulting 
hydrogen and oxygen would then be stored to provide reactant to the cells for the 
next eclipse period. Regenerative fuel cells have been demonstrated in the 
laboratory but have not so far been reduced to engineering practice. 
10.12 Power Conditioning and Control 
The power conditioning or processing portion of the space power system 
carries the responsibility for many of the functions listed earlier in this chapter. 
Power conditioning is necessary because the voltage from the power source may 
vary substantially, especially with solar arrays, which are of course the most 
common source of primary spacecraft power, for a variety of reasons including 
load variability, array temperature, and other external environmental factors. 
Broadly coilsidered, the power conditioning subsystem must fulfill three 
functions on a spacecraft utilizing solar arrays. First, it must control the solar 
array output in response to changes in load requirements and to changes in array 
temperature and sun angle, which as we have seen significantly alter the source 
properties. Second, it must control the battery charge-discharge cycle, supplying 
the proper charging voltage and current and regulating the average discharge 
voltage. Finally, the power system must regulate the voltage supplied to the 
remainder of the spacecraft system to the specified level (within some tolerance), 
thus protecting the other subsystems from the fluctuations already cited. This last 
requirement is obviously present even on spacecraft using RTGs, fuel cells, or 
any other power source. The second requirement may be relevant as well, if the 
peak loads exceed the steady-state source capability. 
In some cases, a variety of voltage levels for different functions may be 
required, but at the very least, main bus regulation will be needed. This concerns a 
the point, discussed earlier, as to whether the power conditioning system should 
supply most or all specific subsystem requirements, or whether it should merely 
be a source of stable bus voltage, allowing individual subsystem designers to deal 
with their own requirements. 
Any electrical noise generated by the power source or the control electronics 
must be isolated from the main bus. The main bus in turn must be isolated from 
any power source faults, such as loss of part of a solar array or voltage transients 
due to entry into and exit from an eclipse period. 
Finally, the power system and other spacecraft subsystems must be protected 
from faults in any other subsystem. We ignore here the issues and design trades 
surrounding the use, or not, of dual-bus power and spacecraft "housekeeping" 
systems, and other aspects of redundancy architecture and management. Some of 
the issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.

Broadly considered, the power conditioning subsystem must fulfill three
functions on a spacecraft utilizing solar arrays. First, it must control the solar
array output in response to changes in load requirements and to changes in array
temperature and sun angle, which as we have seen significantly alter the source
properties. Second, it must control the battery charge-discharge cycle, supplying
the proper charging voltage and current and regulating the average discharge
voltage. Finally, the power system must regulate the voltage supplied to the
remainder of the spacecraft system to the specified level (within some tolerance),
thus protecting the other subsystems from the fluctuations already cited. This last
requirement is obviously present even on spacecraft using RTGs, fuel cells, or
any other power source. The second requirement may be relevant as well, if the
peak loads exceed the steady-state source capability.

In some cases, a variety of voltage levels for different functions may be
required, but at the very least, main bus regulation will be needed. This concerns
the point, discussed earlier, as to whether the power conditioning system should
supply most or all specific subsystem requirements, or whether it should merely
be a source of stable bus voltage, allowing individual subsystem designers to deal
with their own requirements.

Any electrical noise generated by the power source or the control electronics
must be isolated from the main bus. The main bus in turn must be isolated from
any power source faults, such as loss of part of a solar array or voltage transients
due to entry into and exit from an eclipse period.

Finally, the power system and other spacecraft subsystems must be protected
from faults in any other subsystem. We ignore here the issues and design trades
surrounding the use, or not, of dual-bus power and spacecraft “housekeeping”
systems, and other aspects of redundancy architecture and management. Some of
the issues are discussed further in Chapter 12.

Power control systems for spacecraft using solar arrays are broadly 
categorized as dissipative and nondissipative systems. In dissipative systems, 
as the name implies, excess power is shed resistively, while in nondissipative 
systems, the solar array itself is regulated through a DC-DC converter to operate 
at its peak-power point, according to the load demanded from it. As loads 
decrease, the array output is shifted toward its open-circuit high-voltage 
operating point, which yields the lower current that is required. Conversely, as 
loads increase, operation is shifted to a lower-voltage, higher-current operating 
point, up to the maximum power that can be delivered by the array.

because they are not in series with the array output. For this reason, they offer 
excellent overall efficiency and have the additional advantage of inherently 
simpler design, and thus lower parts count. Nondissipative systems are 
commonly called peak power tracking (PPT) systems, a name aptly descriptive of 
their operation. PPT systems are more complex and introduce some inherent 
inefficiency due to the requirement for a DC-DC power converter in series 
between the solar array and the load. However, for LEO spacecraft encountering 
a wide range of operating requirements, and for spacecraft needing maximum 
EOL array operating efficiency, PPT systems can be appropriate. 
In most DET systems, a shunt regulator will be connected across the solar 
array, in parallel with the battery and its charge controller, and with the spacecraft 
loads, as shown in Fig. 10.14. As the name implies, the shunt regulator controls 
spacecraft power by dissipating current in excess of that required by the 
instantaneous load, which consists of battery charging requirements plus 
spacecraft operational needs. Shunt regulators are common because they are 
efficient and because they are simply and reliably implemented.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
In the basic shunt-regulator concept, the bus voltage is unregulated and varies 
between the post-eclipse cold-array voltage on the charge cycle and the battery 
discharge voltage on the discharge cycle. As indicated earlier, this will result in 
considerable bus voltage variation, which may be acceptable. If unacceptable to a 
particular instrument or subsystem, the raw bus voltage must be further regulated 
within the subsystem. 
Alternatively, the spacecraft bus may itself be more carefully regulated, either 
on the charge cycle, the discharge cycle, or both. Figure 10.15 shows a block 
diagram example of a shunt-regulated array with a fully regulated bus. 
The shunt regulator itself can be either a simple linear controller or a switching 
shunt. If a switching shunt is used, the output is pulse-width modulated to 
produce the desired average level, a process resulting in a higher level of self- 
generated electromagnetic interference (EMI) than for a linear shunt. This will 
generally result in the requirement for additional shielding of the system and 
smoothing of the output power to avoid interference with other spacecraft 
systems. 
Series regulation of solar array power to the bus is also possible. Figure 10.16 
provides an example of the concept. In this case, the bus is controlled by 
dissipating excess power through a voltage drop in series with the load. Series 
regulation tends to be more complex than shunt regulation and is therefore less 
common, though there are advantages to providing better control of bus voltage 
as delivered by the solar array. 
As will be obvious, more elaborate electronic control circuitry, operating at 
less overall efficiency, is required if the bus voltage is to be closely regulated. The 
engineering assessment as to whether overall mass and complexity are minimized 
by carefully regulating the main bus, as compared with performing the power 
conditioning at the subsystem level, must be made in each case. In general, larger, 
higher power, more complex satellites will benefit at the system level by having a 
central bus controller, and conversely for smaller, simpler spacecraft.

10.1 3 Future Concepts 
10.13.1 Nuclear Reactors 
Nuclear reactors offer considerable promise for the future. For very large 
power levels, hundreds of kilowatts to megawatts, reactors may be the only viable 
source in the next several decades. The nuclear reaction supplies heat, which is 
converted to electricity by a variety of techniques. Candidate energy conversion 
techniques include thermionics, thermoelectrics, and Stirling, Brayton, or 
Rankine cycle engines driLing an alternator. 
Thermoelectric energy conversion was discussed briefly in connection with 
RTGs. An allied concept, in the sense that it requires no moving parts, is that of 
thermionic energy conversion, which, however, uses a completely different 
concept. In thennionic conversion, heat is converted to electricity by boiling 
electrons from a hot emitter, or cathode, and collecting them at a cooler anode. 
This is exactly the mechanism at work in old-fashioned vacuum tubes, except that 
the heat is supplied by a nuclear reactor rather than by resistive heating of a wire 
filament. 
Practical thermionic systems require the cathode temperature to be very hot, 
1600-2000 K, while the anode must be cooler, 800- 1000 K, to avoid significant 
back-emission of electrons. The spacing between cathode and anode must be 
relatively small, e.g., < 1 rnm. Power densities in the 100-1000 w/m2 range can 
be achieved at a conversion efficiency of 10-15%. The astute reader will note 
that although this is higher than for thermoelectric conversion, it is only about 
half the intrinsic Carnot efficiency at the given cathodelanode temperature 
difference. A more subtle disadvantage is the tendency of the anode and cathode 
to expand differentially, threatening to eliminate the gap between them, which 
must be small but not zero. Manufacturing tolerances for thermionic converters 
are obviously critical. However, these disadvantages are compensated by their 
very high tolerance to heat and radiation, high reliability, and compactness.

SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
All conversion concepts require radiato;s to reject waste heat to space. These 
radiators become very large for high-power units and present a major design 
challenge. Dynamic conversion concepts are generally much more efficient than 
static designs and therefore require a smaller reactor and, in some cases, a smaller 
radiator. Mitigating these advantages is the fact that the vibration and other 
disturbances typical of dynamic systems may be a problem. 
Reactors have the advantage that, until they are in operation, they are not 
highly radioactive and can be handled with relative safety. When in operation, 
however, the radiation is very intense and much more damaging than that 
characteristic of RTGs. Heavy shielding is required even in unmanned 
applications, because electronic components cannot otherwise withstand the 
radiation from the reactor. For manned applications, the shielding and separation 
requirements become far more stringent. Figure 10.17 shows a typical reactor- 
powered spacecraft design using geometric separation to reduce shield mass. In 
the configuration shown, a shadow shield is used to protect only a relatively small 
portion of the volume of space surrounding the reactor, thus saving substantial 
mass. Of course, this design precludes close proximity operations outside the 
shield shadow. An early concept for the SP-100 nuclear reactor-based space 
power system was to have a mass of 3000 kg for a 100-kWe system. However, as

contributed to the program's eventual cancellation. 
The mass-to-power ratio of a reactor design improves somewhat as the size 
increases. Essentially, reactors perfom best where traditional solar power 
systems do poorly, such as on planetary surfaces, at great distances from the sun, 
and when large amounts of power are needed. Because of the severe limitations 
of non-nuclear alternatives, interest has once again arisen in space nuclear power 
options, especially in the larger power output category, but specific details are 
unavailable as this is written. 
10.13.2 Dynamfc Isotope Systems 
The dynamic isotope system is a concept for obtaining more electrical power 
from the same isotope heat source as used for a traditional RTG. In this approach, 
the heat from the decaying isotope is used to heat the working fluid of a Brayton, 
Rankine, or Stirling cycle engine, which in turn drives an alternator. Because of 
the much higher conversion efficiency of these dynamic systems as compared to 
that of thermoelectric or thermionic systems, 500-700% more power can be 
obtained from a given quantity of isotope. This has advantages in reducing cost, 
radiation exposure, and mass. Detrimental factors include a reduction in 
reliability due to the added moving parts and the vibration that any dynamic 
system will tend to generate. Another possible disadvantage is the requirement to 
shed waste heat at a temperature lower than that of a typical RTG, thus requiring 
larger radiator area. (This comment might appear to conflict with the advantage 
cited earlier regarding the possibility of having smaller radiators. Indeed, either 
result may be true. High thermal efficiency requires a low cold-side temperature, 
and thus a larger radiator. However, higher intrinsic conversion efficiency by 
itself allows a smaller radiator. The net result depends on the particular system 
parameters for a given case.) Dynamic isotope conversion systems have been 
tested extensively but, as this is written, have not been flown. 
10.13.3 AMTEC 
An interesting energy conversion concept for potential future use is the alkali 
metal thermal-to-electric conversion (AMTEC). This device has no moving parts 
(if we may ignore the sodium working fluid being circulated by electromagnetic 
pumps) but offers potential conversion efficiencies approaching those of dynamic 
systems. In the AMTEC concept, sodium heated to the point of ionization by the 
primary energy source is applied to one side of a ceramic membrane that 
conducts sodium ions but not electrons. Thus, the positive sodium ions pass 
through, but electrons tend to accumulate. A conductive film on the membrane 
collects the electrons, which are then conducted through a load to the downstream 
side of the membrane to neutralize the sodium ions. A number of problems must 
be solved, including membrane life, sodium condensation management in Og, and

10.13.4 Solar Dynamic Systems 
Solar dynamic systems, as the name implies, feature machines such as 
Brayton, Rankine, or Stirling cycle engines driving an electrical generator or 
alternator and using the sun as the primary energy source. These units offer 
potential conversion efficiency five to seven times that of solar photovoltaic 
arrays, which becomes very attractive at high power levels, e.g., above 100 kW. 
At such levels, photovoltaic arrays are expensive and pose attitude control and 
atmospheric drag problems due to their large size. The reduction in area of 
collectors for the dynamic system greatly reduces drag and stability concerns and 
becomes cost-competitive as well at high power. However, this approach does 
carry the usual dynamic system problems of reduced reliability, possible 
vibration, and possible attitude control system interactions. Also, the size 
advantage may be partially offset by the requirement for waste heat radiators 
associated with these conversion concepts. 
10.13.5 Radiators 
.We have referred on several occasions to the need for radiator surfaces to 
dispose of waste heat. As systems become larger, the significance of the radiator 
increases until, for very large systems, it may be the largest single item. Present 
radiator concepts utilize large thin skins, usually made of metal. The heat to be 
dissipated may be delivered by conduction, by a pumped fluid loop, or by an array 
of heat pipes. Conventional radiators are limited by such factors as the allowable 
material temperature, achievable surface-to-mass ratio, surface emissivity, and 
thermal conductivity. A variety of innovative concepts have been proposed to 
provide highkr capability radiators, including droplet radiators, membrane 
radiators, and rotating band radiators. 
The droplet radiator offers very high performance because of the large 
surface-to-volume ratio of the droplets and the possibility of allowing a liquid-to- 
solid phase change, thus greatly increasing the energy removal. However, several 
practical problems must be solved before this concept can be implemented, 
including droplet generation and collection (especially while maneuvering) and 
materials selection. 
The membrane radiator achieves high efficiency by allowing a fluid to flow 
down the inside of a contoured rotating membrane. The resulting convective heat 
transfer, itself a high-efficiency heat transfer mechanism (see Chapter 9), may be 
enhanced by a gas-to-liquid phase change. Small punctures in the membrane can 
be tolerated, because surface tension in the fluid will prevent leakage. As always, 
the requirement to rotate may be a problem. Material selection and the

11 .I Introduction 
Telecommunications in space differs from the earthbound version in two 
major respects: 1) its long range, which may be anything from a few hundred to 
several billion kilometers, and 2) the potentially large relative velocity between 
transmitter and receiver, so that Doppler shift becomes significant (+_ 50 kHz in 
the S-band for low Earth orbit), requiring complex frequency-tracking loops in 
the receiver. Also, spacecraft in low orbit see very limited communications 
coverage from any single surface station. A station that can track to within 5" of 
the horizon will view a spacecraft in a 300-km orbit for only 6.5 rnin, even for a 
zenith pass. At the opposite extreme, distant spacecraft move very slowly against 
the background of the fixed stars, thus, the pass time is essentially governed by 
the rotation of the Earth. Signals from distant spacecraft, because they are very 
weak, require tracking by large, specialized equipment, such as NASAs Deep 
Space Network (DSN). 
These factors complicate spacecraft design because of the mismatch between 
the rates of data acquisition and return. In low Earth orbit (LEO) a spacecraft may 
collect data throughout the orbit period of perhaps 95 min. Given only one 
downlink station, the spacecraft can dump data only a few times per day. Clearly, 
the downlink data rate must be many times that of the acquisition rate even with 
onboard processing and compression of the data. Power limitations and range 
restrict the rate at which data can be returned from a spacecraft at another planet. 
Data may be acquired very rapidly during an encounter and then played back at a 
relatively low rate over a long period.

11.1. Introduction

Telecommunications in space differs from the earthbound version in two
major respects: 1) its long range, which may be anything from a few hundred to
several billion kilometers, and 2) the potentially large relative velocity between
transmitter and receiver, so that Doppler shift becomes significant (+ 50 kHz in
the S-band for low Earth orbit), requiring complex frequency-tracking loops in
the receiver. Also, spacecraft in low orbit see very limited communications
coverage from any single surface station. A station that can track to within 5° of
the horizon will view a spacecraft in a 300-km orbit for only 6.5 min, even for a
zenith pass. At the opposite extreme, distant spacecraft move very slowly against
the background of the fixed stars, thus, the pass time is essentially governed by
the rotation of the Earth. Signals from distant spacecraft, because they are very
weak, require tracking by large, specialized equipment, such as NASAs Deep
Space Network (DSN).

These factors complicate spacecraft design because of the mismatch between
the rates of data acquisition and return. In low Earth orbit (LEO) a spacecraft may
collect data throughout the orbit period of perhaps 95 min. Given only one
downlink station, the spacecraft can dump data only a few times per day. Clearly,
the downlink data rate must be many times that of the acquisition rate even with

restrict the rate at which data can be returned from a spacecraft at another planet.
Data may be acquired very rapidly during an encounter and then played back at a

Moreover, passage through the Earth’s troposphere and ionosphere
complicates signal propagation, as a result of energy absorption, rotation of
polarized signals, etc. We will examine these effects in more detail later.

environment normally do not unduly affect the electronics of the telecommu- 
nications system, which is usually located in the temperature-controlled interior 
of the spacecraft, but external equipment such as antennas may be strongly driven 
by thermal design considerations. 
Because of its role in accepting ground commands and returning data, the 
telecommunications system interfaces directly or indirectly with virtually every 
spacecraft subsystem and experiment. The earthbound end of a link interfaces 
with tracking stations, and through them with operating agencies around the 
world. 
11.2 Command Subsystem 
The command subsystem allows instructions and data to be sent to the 
spacecraft. In some cases the command will be acted upon immediately; in others 
it may be stored to be acted upon when a particular clock time is reached, some 
event is sensed, or a particular spacecraft state is attained. 
Concepmally, the two basic command types may be characterized as relay 
commands and data commands. The former are functionally equivalent to switch 
closures and may provide a simple on/off function or initiate a complex, stepwise 
operational sequence. Such commands may provide a pulse signal or may latch in 
a new state until a further command is received (in the switch analogy, a 
momentary contact vs a toggle). 
Data commands, as the name implies, provide information upon which the 
spacecraft acts, such as the direction and magnitude of a translation maneuver. 
Later in this chapter we will discuss how such commands are structured. 
A complex operation such as a thruster firing to cause a midcourse correction 
might involve the transmission of a substantial number of data commands 
involving directions and magnitude of attitude maneuvers, rocket motor burn 
time, or required change in velocity, and maneuvers back to cruise attitude. In 
addition, a number of relay commands might be required to configure the 
spacecraft for the maneuver (e.g., science instruments off, telecommunications 
from high gain to omnidirectional antenna, etc.). A final relay command to enable 
the sequence of actions would probably be required as well. 
This example of midcourse correction illustrates the need for the two types of 
commands and also the need for delayed commands. The maneuver may need to 
take place out of sight of ground stations, or the timing may be so critical that it is 
not acceptable to depend on ground commands, where the communications 
uplink might be lost at a critical time. 
The length and structure of command messages and individual words will 
depend on the amount of information to be sent and the capability of the 
equipment. In addition to the actual information, there will be address, 
identification, and other formatting data bits that must be transmitted and can 
substantially increase the overall data rate.

The component choices for the command subsystem are much the same as 
those for Earth applications: bipolar transistors, n-type metal-oxide serniconduc- 
tors (NMOS), and complementary metal-oxide semiconductors (CMOS). Bipolar 
transistors are slowest and use the most power but are usually the most resistant to 
radiation. The higher speed and lower power consumption of the conventional 
metal-oxide semiconductors come at the cost of much greater sensitivity to 
radiation, unless special radiation-hardening measures are taken in their design. 
Although such issues are well understood today, it remains true that the radiation- 
hardening requirement for spaceborne electronic systems represents the single 
greatest departure from designs suitable for ground-based applications, and 
almost by itself accounts for the "generation gap" between the sophistication of 
state-of-the-art consumer electronics and that which is intended for space 
applications. 
Radiation causes long-term degradation of components and eventual loss of 
function. This can occur through a variety of mechanisms, depending on the type 
of radiation. As a more immediate problem, energetic charged particles passing 
through the junctions of the components can cause "soft," or temporary, errors. 
Deposition of sufficient energy in a junction can cause it to "flip," leaving, for 
example, a logical 1 where a 0 had been. If this particular junction contains a bit 
that is part of a data command, erroneous data now reside in that register. 
In the more common soft-error case, the error can be corrected by reloading 
the command. The damage is not permanent. In the case of CMOS circuitry, the 
energy deposition can destroy the junction, in what is called a latchup condition. 
Modem CMOS circuits normally have latchup protection for space applications 
but availability may be limited. 
The smaller the junction-and small size is the means by which high speed 
and low power consumption are achieved-the lower is the energy required to 
cause the phenomena just discussed. Thus, the improvements in electronic 
component technology that have allowed us to design more capability into given 
power and volume constraints have simultaneously increased the susceptibility to 
radiation damage. Because the problem primarily concerns space operations, 
most research into radiation-hardened electronics has been done by NASA and 
the Departments of Defense and Energy. Production of such components is 
limited, which makes them expensive. One obvious solution to the radiation 
problem is shielding. Unfortunately, this is often of only limited practicality, as 
discussed in Chapter 3.

reliability, a single failure in each string will still cause loss of the command 
function. A more sophisticated approach employs redundancy at the subsystem I 
level, with cross-strapping such that a given subassembly can be used in either 
string. 
In this arrangement one or more failures can occur in each string, but as long 
as there are no duplicate failures in each string (i.e., at least one of each type of 
subassembly is working), a working command system can be assembled by I 
selective cross-strapping between the strings. 
Control and management of redundancy is a complex issue, which, when 
improperly done, can lead to serious pitfalls. The redundancy scheme must be 
examined with care to avoid inadvertent and irreversible switchovers, possible 
untested modes, etc. Also, care must be taken so that the system is truly 
redundant; for example, two fully duplicated strings operating off a single fused 
power cable are not redundant. 
Although an exhaustive discussion of reliability and redundancy management 
is beyond the scope of this text, these topics are addressed in somewhat more 
detail in Chapter 12. 
11.4 Autonomy 
With the development of ever increasing computer capability and the under- 
taking of more complex missions at more distant targets, spacecraft have become 
more autonomous. Moore's Law-the empirical rule enunciated by Intel's 
Gordon Moore and now well into several decades of apparent applicability- 
implies that computational throughput doubles every 24 months. The 
implications for spacecraft software systems have been as profound as those 
for the conventional consumer electronic systems with which every reader will 
be familiar. 
Thus, for many years the trend in spacecraft management has been away from 
very detailed command sequences, exhaustively vetted on the ground, and toward 
the use of high-level commands. As an example, a spacecraft might simply be 
commanded to apply a specified AV in a given direction. It would then 
autonomously compute and execute the required attitude maneuvers and the 
rocket motor burn. Still more advanced (and not yet practical) spacecraft would 
perform navigation onboard and autonomously decide that a course correction is 
required and perform it. 
The advantages of higher levels of autonomy are obvious. The size of the 
ground operations crew and support team is reduced-a major savings because 
for long missions the cost of flight operations can easily exceed that of 
development and launch. Reliability can be enhanced because success is no 
longer as dependent on the link to Earth. Indeed, in some cases autonomous 
systems can prevent damage that would have occurred on distant spacecraft even

before the telltale telemetry indicative of any concern could have arrived at 
Earth ! 
However, an autonomous spacecraft for a given mission will always be more 
complex than a ground-controlled machine. (This overlooks very simple 
spacecraft such as the early Explorers and Pioneers, which had no uplink, used a 
single operating state, and were always on, collecting data and sending it to the 
Earth whether or not anyone was listening.) The increased complexity implies a 
greater variety of spacecraft states and operating modes to be considered in 
system design and testing. Because it is probably impossible to test every 
conceivable mode, a great deal of consideration must go into the design of a 
system free of traps and testable with reasonable time and effort. 
Today's reality is that all spacecraft operate in a largely autonomous fashion, 
with periodic monitoring by mission control personnel to an extent that depends 
on the characteristics of the mission. Economic realities mandate this practice for 
near-Earth spacecraft, and round-trip communications delays impose it on 
planetary spacecraft. Modern computers and the software tools that they host are 
directly responsible for the stunning capabilities evident today in all classes of 
spacecraft. However, in common with other systems incorporating complex 
software control schemes, it is equally true that many embarrassing failures have 
resulted directly from the unanticipated behavior of such systems, in concert with 
the difficulty of comprehensively testing all possible vehicle states. 
The ill-fated Mars Polar Lander (MPL) mission provides an object lesson in 
this regard. Intended for a 1999 landing near the south pole of Mars, the 
spacecraft essentially vanished following separation from its cruise stage in 
preparation for the landing sequence. The report1 of the independent failure 
review board provides interesting reading for those hoping to draw lessons in 
system engineering from this event. Worthy of note is that, while the review 
board found several possible causes of failure, the most probable cause was found 
to lie within the software design of' the necessarily automated landing sequence. 
The MPL landing legs were equipped with sensors to detect the transient 
shock of the landing event, so that when surface contact occurred, the descent 
engine could be shut down. However, deployment of the landing gear from its 
stowed position would, by itself, generate essentially the same transient shocks as 
the landing. There was no specific software system requirement to clear the 
memory buffers recording this event after the landing gear deployment, and so 
the landing sequence logic reacted as it was designed to do, shutting down the 
descent engine because the presence of a "surface contact'' event had been 
(erroneously) detected. Because this occurred at altitude rather than on the 
surface, the spacecraft crashed. It was noted by the review board that, while other 
problems could possibly have caused spacecraft failure prior to this point in the 
landing sequence, this problem would certainly have resulted in destruction of the

Further communication was to ensue following a successful landing. Clearly, 
there are many lessons to be drawn from this mission by attentive space system 
engineers. 
11.5 Command Subsystem Elements 
Figure 1 1.1 presents a basic functional block diagram of a typical spacecraft 
command subsystem. The major elements that make up the subsystem are defined 
in the diagram and are discussed in the following paragraphs. It is worth noting 
that, while the functional blocks depicted in Fig. 11.1 have changed little over the I 
years, implementation methods have changed greatly. Where once each block 
was a separate hardware element, today many of the functional elements are 
merely different subroutines in a system consisting largely of software. 
11.5.1 Antennas 
For LEO missions the uplink, or command antenna, will usually be omni- 
directional to facilitate communication from ground stations while the aspect 
angle is changing during the pass. Deep space missions, in contrast, require 
directional high-gain antennas and thus attitude and articulation control. Except 
for use near the Earth, such missions also carry omnidirectional antennas to aid 
operations and to avoid overdriving the receiver with excessive gain at short 
range. Capability to send uplink commands through a low-gain omnidirectional

Further communication was to ensue following a successful landing. Clearly,
there are many lessons to be drawn from this mission by attentive space system
engineers.

11.5 Command Subsystem Elements

Figure 11.1 presents a basic functional block diagram of a typical spacecraft
command subsystem. The major elements that make up the subsystem are defined
in the diagram and are discussed in the following paragraphs. It is worth noting
that, while the functional blocks depicted in Fig. 11.1 have changed little over the
years, implementation methods have changed greatly. Where once each block
was a separate hardware element, today many of the functional elements are
merely different subroutines in a system consisting largely of software.

11.5.1 Antennas

For LEO missions the uplink, or command antenna, will usually be omni-
directional to facilitate communication from ground stations while the aspect
angle is changing during the pass. Deep space missions, in contrast, require
directional high-gain antennas and thus attitude and articulation control. Except
for use near the Earth, such missions also carry omnidirectional antennas to aid
operations and to avoid overdriving the receiver with excessive gain at short
range. Capability to send uplink commands through a low-gain omnidirectional

antenna should be retained for emergency use even at long range. Anomalous 
behavior resulting in loss of high-gain antenna pointing may cause loss of 
the mission if no other way exists to get commands into the spacecraft. The 
capability to broadcast commands from the Earth at very high power to the 
omnidirectional antenna might save the spacecraft. 
1 1.5.2 Receivers 
The receiver may be either two types: tuned radio frequency (TRF) or, more 
commonly, superheterodyne. Details of the two types go beyond the scope of 
this text. Briefly, the TRF is a radio-frequency (RF) amplifier, tuned for a 
narrow bandwidth around the transmitted frequency, followed by a detector or 
demodulator stage and several stages of low-frequency amplification. In a 
superheterodyne receiver the received signal is shifted in frequency (heterodyned 
or mixed) to a frequency lower than the transmitted one. Two or more shifts are 
common, and the resulting signal is amplified and filtered at each stage to provide 
greater sensitivity to weak signals and better selectivity for rejection of unwanted 
signals. 
11.5.3 Modulation 
The receiver and uplink may use amplitude modulation (AM), phase 
modulation (PM), or frequency modulation (FM). The choice depends on several 
factors, including required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), desire for graceful 
degradation, available RF bandwidth, required data rate, hardware complexity, 
and compatibility with existing ground tracking systems. 
FM and PM systems can operate with lower RF signal-to-noise ratios than AM 
systems because FRI and PM provide improved performance at the cost of greater 
bandwidth. FM and PM systems suffer the penalty of a threshold effect. As the 
SNR on the RF link decreases, the performance of the link degrades very slowly 
until the threshold SNR is reached. As the SNR progresses below the threshold, 
the performance of the link drops precipitously. AM systems do not exhibit this 
behavior. They require more SNR to achieve a given performance but degrade 
gracefully as the SNR is reduced. (The reader can experience this with an 
automobile radio when driving away from a station. FM will remain reasonably 
clear up to some distance from the station, when the signal abruptly deteriorates 
and is lost. AM becomes progressively weaker, probably with distortion 
increasing, but will remain audible through the noise for a long period.) 
A high degree of frequency selectivity is essential in spacecraft receivers 
to enhance SNR and to reduce sensitivity to electromagnetic interference 
(EMI). During ground testing and launch, spacecraft operate in a very signal- 
rich environment and even in orbit will be illuminated by unwanted 
signals. Frequency selectivity is essential in such situations.

In addition to amplifying the signal and filtering out noise and EMI, the 
receiver demodulates the signal and provides the information-bearing portion of 
the received signal to the command decoder and processor. 
It is a cardinal rule that the command receiver is always on. If a command 
exists that can turn off the receiver, and such a corn-mand is inadvertently sent 
(erroneous commands do occur), there would be no way to undo the damage. Of 
course, mechanisms could be devised to turn it back on after a time, or some other 
recovery approach could be employed, but the straightforward and therefore 
preferred approach simply has the receiver permanently on. 
The command decoder (not shown separately in Fig. 11.1) may be viewed 
as the first stage in command processing. The decoder first inspects the identifier 
bits that make up a part of each command word. These bits identify the word as 
a command and are used to synchronize the bit stream along command word 
boundaries. They also contain the address of the intended spacecraft. The 
decoder verifies that the word is a command and is intended for this spacecraft. In 
the case of an encrypted command string, appropriate decryption algorithms 
must be applied in the process. The decoder then passes the bit string to the 
command processor. 
11.5.4 Command Processor 
In early spacecraft the command processor was a simple hardwired (and 
therefore inflexible) circuit. The command processor in a modem spacecraft is 
usually just another functional block of code in a multipurpose processor. The 
processor interprets the command for proper destination and required action. 
As a precaution against erroneous action, commands are checked for validity 
using parity bits or more sophisticated error detection and correction (EDAC) 
schemes. The processor then sends the signal to the appropriate destination: 
elsewhere in the computer, an onboard storage memory unit, or directly to a 
power-switching unit. 
The central processor executes the more complex operations involving data 
commands and delayed commands. In early spacecraft the "computer" was little 
more than a programmable sequencer. With increasing sophistication, spacecraft 
computers have become quite capable data processors. Today's microprocessor 
technology allows a distributed architecture in which most of the computational 
power resides in the subsystems, and the central computer functions primarily as 
. a coordinator. Unless an extremely large amount of data must be stored, solid- 
state memory usually proves sufficient. 
The power-switching elements are the interface circuits between the command 
subsystem and the remaining spacecraft subsystems. These elements may consist 
of pulsed or latching relays or solid-state switches. More complex operations may 
require sequences of steps to achieve the desired goal. The switching elements

11.5.5 Telemetry Subsystem 
The telemetry subsystem takes engineering or scientific data and prepares 
them for transmission to the ground. Figure 11.2 presents the functional block 
diagram of a typical spacecraft telemetry subsystem. 
The data are generated by sensors or transducers responding to events in the 
"outside world." In this context the outside world may be other subsystems in the 
spacecraft that generate data concerning their status and condition, or events 
in the surrounding environment as sensed by the science subsystem. Parameters 
that are measured often include acceleration, angular rate, angular position, 
pressure, temperature, density, resistance, voltage, current, intensity, electric 
field, magnetic field, and radiant energy. 
It may be said that the sensors and transducers are not truly part of the 
telemetry system, but rather of the subsystem in which they reside. This argument 
carries most weight in regard to the science instruments. In any case, these 
elements provide the signals upon which the telemetry system operates. 
Signals from the sensors or transducers are rarely in a form immediately 
suitable to the data-formatting element. Generally, the signal must be 
"conditioned" and converted from analog to digital. Signal conditioning converts 
data to a form that is acceptable to the telemetry system. Weak signals may be 
amplified or excessively strong signals attenuated. High- or low-pass filters are 
used to remove bias or noise; notch filters are used to remove high-intensity 
signals in a specific frequency band. A signal's dynamic range may be com- 
pressed, perhaps by the use of a logarithmic amplifier. Every effort will be made 
to achieve isolation between signals to ensure accuracy of the data.

Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC), one of the major functions of signal 
conditioning, will usually be required because, generally, the real world is 
analog; it varies more or less continuously across the range of the phenomenon 
being observed. Spacecraft data, on the other hand, can be handled more 
efficiently in digital form, as a series of discrete steps. 
Figure P 1.3 shows the process schematically. The smooth curve represents the 
phenomenon being measured. The digital approximation is represented by the I 
"stair steps," where the quantized level is proportional to the average value 
during the sampling period or the value at the sampling instant. The sampled 
value is restricted to one of a finite number of allowable values so that the 
digitized data can be represented by a finite number of bits. The analog input 
could be a voltage curve, between prescribed limits, which a transducer produces 
in response to a phenomenon. The curve may be directly proportional to the 
phenomenon or may have been modified, perhaps by a log amplifier, to make the 
range compatible with the telemetry system. The output of the digitizer is a 
binary word for each digitized data point. The data are quantized into one of 2" I 
levels, where a is the number of bits in the data word. Several types of analog-to- 
digital converters are available to do this. The flash ADC can operate at rates in 
the tens of megahertz range, but it is noisy. The successive-approximation 
register can handle data rates of hundreds of kilohertz. The integrating ADC 
can handle only tens of hertz, but produces very clean data. The details of the 
logic circuitry associated with different types of ADCs are beyond the scope of 
this text. 
Several errors are inherent in the ADC process and the subsequent recon- 
version to analog that most data undergo on the ground. As with any telemetry 
system, the measured signal will be embedded in noise. A noisy analog input may 
fool the ADC into digitizing at a level higher than the actual level of the signal.

may be able to reject the noise and infer the true data. In the digitized and 
reconstructed data the analyst will not see the original data but rather a quantized

the correct data, or even to recognize that the data are noisy.

at any point may fall between the levels. If eight bits are used to transmit each

Handling more than one data type requires some form of multiplexing by the 
telecommunication system. This usually takes one of three forms. 
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) subdivides the frequency bandwidth 
of the telemetry downlinks (Fig. 11.4) and allocates the various data streams to 
separate portions of the available bandwidth. In the temporal sense the data may 
be viewed as going out in parallel. The subdivision of the bandwidth is not 
necessarily equal; higher rate data streams must be allocated wider bandwidths. 
This approach is common when one or more channels of high rate data (e.g., 
video) are to be returned. It is possible to apply the other schemes discussed later 
to the individual channels within the FDM structure, and these channels may be 
analog or digital. 
Time-division multiplexing (TDM) employs temporal separation to assign 
different sets of bits within a data frame to different users, as depicted in Fig. 1 1.5. 
The frame repeats continuously, with each user occupying the assigned bits in a 
cyclic fashion. Note that the cycle may be subcornmutated, with more than one 
user sharing a particular set of bits in a subpattern within the overall sequence. By 
convention, frames are limited to 2048 bits with word lengths of 6-64 bits. 
Within these limits virtually any level of subframe definition is possible. 
The final type of multiplexing, code-division multiplexing (CDM), sends the 
data in parallel over the same bandwidth during the same time period, but 
encoded using spread-spectrum techniques so that the individual streams can be 
separated at the re~eiver.~

f The problem of "aliasing" is a major concern in any digital communication. 
If a band-limited, sampled signal is to be reconstructed accurately, it must be 
sampled at a rate at least twice the maximum frequency contained in the signal. 
This minimum sampling rate is called the Nyquist rate. A simple example will 
illustrate the problem. Assume that a sinusoidally varying signal at 1000 Hz is 
being sampled at 1000 Hz (half the required Nyquist rate). In this example the 
digitizer would always sample the same point on the waveform, and the data 
appear constant-a straight line with no indication of the true signal.

field for attitude control. A 20-Hz variation in the field may be of substantial 
scientific interest but is of no interest for attitude control, where 1-Hz resolution 
would normally suffice. 
Sampling rates based on the Nyquist criterion are shown in Table 1 1.1. As

In the (somewhat improbable) event that the commutation rate perfectly 
matches the desired sample rate for all data elements, each data element would 
appear once per subframe, and each subframe would be identical. In fact, 
however, there are always parameters that vary so slowly that sampling at a lower 
I rate is acceptable. The same data-element position can thus carry many different 
low-rate parameters in each subframe, each sampled at less than the basic frame 
rate. This subcornmutation is represented by data elements 4A, 4B, and 4C in Fig. 
11.6. The majority of data elements, represented by 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the figure, 
will be sampled at the basic rate. Note, however, that element 1 appears twice in 
each minor frame, and is thus sampled at twice the basic rate. This is called 
supercommutation. 
The engineering telemetry requirements of a spacecraft propulsion unit can 
illustrate this practice. The temperature of the propellant line, tank, and 
pressurant bottle will change slowly and might be subcommutated as element 4. 
Tank and bottle pressures will change more rapidly and would be sampled at 
the basic rate. Thrust chamber pressure-the most dynamic and crucial to 
performance-might be supercommutated as element 1, or at an even faster rate. 
For proper telemetry interpretation some additional information must be 
included along with the measurement data. The major frames and often the minor 
frames will include additional bits for frame synchronization and identification. 
Extra bits will often be included for error detection and correction. The minimum 
would be a single bit for parity check. Incorrect parity would indicate that one bit, 
1 or some odd number of bits, had been erroneously received, but there would be no 
. indication of where the error@) had occurred. Note also that an error affecting an 
even number of bits would go undetected. More complex schemes for error 
correction require additional bits, and greater encoding and decoding complexity. 
To allow the decoding system to synchronize with the downlinked data, frame 
synchronization bits are sent at the beginning of major or minor frames. The 
number of bits, by convention, will be 33 or less, with 24 being common for a 
major frame. Sending synchronization bits with each frame ensures proper 
synchronization, regardless of phase or frequency errors since the previous 
frame. Without this concern synchronization bits would be needed only at the

Fig. 11.6 Subcommutation and supercommutation.

In the (somewhat improbable) event that the commutation rate perfectly
matches the desired sample rate for all data elements, each data element would
appear once per subframe, and each subframe would be identical. In fact,
however, there are always parameters that vary so slowly that sampling at a lower
rate is acceptable. The same data-element position can thus carry many different
low-rate parameters in each subframe, each sampled at less than the basic frame
rate. This subcommutation is represented by data elements 4A, 4B, and 4C in Fig.
11.6. The majority of data elements, represented by 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the figure,
will be sampled at the basic rate. Note, however, that element 1 appears twice in
each minor frame, and is thus sampled at twice the basic rate. This is called
supercommutation.

The engineering telemetry requirements of a spacecraft propulsion unit can
illustrate this practice. The temperature of the propellant line, tank, and
pressurant bottle will change slowly and might be subcommutated as element 4.
Tank and bottle pressures will change more rapidly and would be sampled at
the basic rate. Thrust chamber pressure—the most dynamic and crucial to
performance—might be supercommutated as element 1, or at an even faster rate.

For proper telemetry interpretation some additional information must be
included along with the measurement data. The major frames and often the minor
frames will include additional bits for frame synchronization and identification.
Extra bits will often be included for error detection and correction. The minimum
would be a single bit for parity check. Incorrect parity would indicate that one bit,
or some odd number of bits, had been erroneously received, but there would be no
indication of where the error(s) had occurred. Note also that an error affecting an
even number of bits would go undetected. More complex schemes for error
correction require additional bits, and greater encoding and decoding complexity.

To allow the decoding system to synchronize with the downlinked data, frame
synchronization bits are sent at the beginning of major or minor frames. The
number of bits, by convention, will be 33 or less, with 24 being common for a
major frame. Sending synchronization bits with each frame ensures proper
synchronization, regardless of phase or frequency errors since the previous
frame. Without this concern synchronization bits would be needed only at the
beginning of the stream.

A final type of information required is a time tag. In most cases, for the data to 
be useful, it must be accurately annotated (commonly within 1 ms) as to the time 
of acquisition, and the time data must be included in the data frame. The time 
base is usually supplied by a stable crystal oscillator, often the same oscillator 
that comprises the clock in the onboard computer. 
Telemetry formats vary from system to system, and the ratio of "overhead" 
bits to actual data will vary to some degree. In all cases the overhead is 
substantial, and the required telemetry bit rate will always be higher than the 
information bit rate. For many reasons, including power and antenna size, it is 
desirable to reduce the number of bits that must be transmitted. A variety of data- 
compression and data-encoding schemes have been devised and are in current 
use. This rather specialized field will not be covered here.

computing power at considerably higher cost that his ground-based counterpart, a 
situation that seems likely to continue indefinitely into the future. Some 
information regarding current space-qualified processors and future trends may 
help to put the foregoing discussion in perspective. 
Clock speeds of up to 132 MHz are available, with a word length of 32 bits 
(although others do appear; the authors have seen 18-, 24, and 64-bit processors 
in particular cases). Raw clock speed is a useful but not definitive measure of 
overall processor capability. The useful throughput of a computer is a complex 
function of architecture, word length, instruction set, and cycle time, and must 
usually be determined by benchmark runs of the system. The basic capability will 
be degraded 10% or more by error detection and correction codes (EDAC). With 
these qualifications, radiation-hardened processors available in the early 2000s 
can provide 200-300 million instructions per second (MIPS) for the typical mix 
of instructions encountered in spacecraft operations, with 500-700 MIPS 
capability expected in the near term. Random access memory (RAM) of 128- 
512 megabytes (MB) is available. 
Processor module mass will be on the order of 0.3-0.5 kg at the board level, 
depending on the capacity of the machine, the technology in use, and other 
factors. Packaging requirements will vary with the application but will typically 
add several kilograms to the basic board-level mass requirement. Power 
requirements will be on the order of 5-10 W, depending on speed, memory size 
and type, and architecture. 
Performance comparisons with even commercially available desktop personal 
computers are not impressive. Most readers will recognize that in this same early 
2000s timeframe, clock speeds of several GHz are commonly available, with up 
to 1-2 GB of RAM. This performance gap is, as we have stated previously, 
primarily due to the more stringent environmental and packaging requirements 
placed on spacehe electronic systems, and particularly those associated with 
radiation hardness requirements. 
The issue of parts qualification has been discussed previously in this and other 
chapters. Space-qualified (class S) parts are expensive and typically have long 
delivery times. In fact, in some cases they may be impossible to obtain unless the 
project will pay for flight qualification and maintenance of a special production 
and test operation. This situation occurs because manufacturers show more 
interest in the commercial market, with production of millions of units, than in 
the much more limited aerospace market. One option is the use of class B parts, 
which are functionally equivalent to class S but lack the pedigree and the 
screening and testing that define class S. An in-house screening and burn-in 
program to provide the effective equivalent of class S parts may be a cost- 
effective answer. There are many subtleties in the parts selection and screening 
business, far more than we can treat here. Consultation with specialists in 
reliability, safety, and quality assurance (RS and QA) is to be recommended.

The requirement for radiation hardness presents a problem that cannot be

526 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
required, especially for spacecraft operating above low orbit and incorporating 
state-of-the-art electronics (e.g., 0.15 pm design rules as this is written). The soft- 
error rate experienced on the first Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) was 
on the order of one per day, a value characteristic of unhardened processors of 
that (early 1980s) era. Extra shielding usually is not effective in reducing this rate 
because of the high energy of the offending particles. Special components and 
failure-tolerant architectures may be required. 
Current spacecraft processor technology offers total dose hmdening in the 
range of 0.25- 1 Mrad, with a latchup-protected single-event upset rate of less 
than 10- lo errors/bit/day. Specially designed systems for military application 
can exceed 1 Mrad of total dose hardening and can provide a prompt dose upset 
tolerance on the order of 10' rad/s, with survival tolerance to about 10'%ad/s. 
1 1.5.7 Onboard Storage 
Mass storage is required when data cannot be sent over the downlink at the 
time they are taken or at the rate of acquisition. Storage is also required in the 
common case.where significant amounts of reference data are required. 
Ground-based computer systems have used a wide variety of storage media, 
including, especially in earlier decades, punch cards, paper tape, magnetic drums, 
magnetic tape, magnetic core, "floppy" disks, plated wire memory, and 
occasionally bubble memory. More recently, many of these media have been 
rendered essentially obsolete, with favored storage media today including floppy 
disks, "hard" disks, zipTM disks, CD-ROM and CD-RW optical disks, solid state 
memory, and memory "sticks." Occasionally one still finds requirements for 
mass storage of serial data, for which magnetic tape may be appropriate, in part 
because tape storage can be very cheap. 
Figures of merit for mass storage for ground applications today are little short 
of miraculous by standards applicable only a few years past. In the early 2000s, 
laptop and desktop computers are available with several gigabytes of solid-state 
random access memory (RAM), hd hard disk capacity of a hundred GB or more. 
Solid-state memory costs substantially less than $l/MB, and hard disk capacity 
retails for no more than $l/GB. Portable zipTM disks capable of holding 250 MB 
are available for a few dollars, and rewriteable compact disks (CD-RW) are even 
cheaper. 
As noted earlier, this rosy picture-which is improving on time scales so short 
that no text could hope to present a current assessment of the state of the art- 
deteriorates rapidly when space applications are considered. Harsher environ- 
mental requirements, especially in regard to radiation hardness, the desire to 
avoid the use of moving parts wherever possible, and (except in manned 
spacecraft) the lack of human interaction, have severely restricted the types of 
mass storage used in space applications.

Current spacecraft processor technology offers total dose hardening in the
range of 0.25~—1 Mrad, with a latchup-protected single-event upset rate of less
than 107 ?° errors /bit/day. Specially designed systems for military application
can exceed 1 Mrad of total dose hardening and can provide a prompt dose upset
tolerance on the order of 10° rad/s, with survival tolerance to about 10!” rad/s.

' spacecraft. Magnetic bubble memory has seen application in certain high- 
radiation, primarily military, applications. However, as this is written, the 
I overwhelming choice for mass memory storage on spacecraft is solid-state 
memory, which has evolved at a pace far outstripping other technologies. The 
early-2000s market offers radiation-hardened, space-qualified mass storage 
capability in standard packages featuring up to 2 terabits (Tb) capacity, with I/O 
on as many as 10 independent channels at a Gbps on each channel. More capacity 
can be obtained, albeit on a custom-design basis. 
Conventional hard disks, familiar to any desktop personal computer user, are 
seeing increased utility. Currently available systems offer packaged solutions 
featuring, for example, up to eight "ganged" hard disks with 110 capability of 
about 0.5 GBps and over 500 GB total capacity. Hard disk systems, as with the 
tape recorders so common in earlier years, carry the liability of moving parts, 
always a matter of concern when extended lifetime is required. 
Optical disks would seem to have tremendous potential for relatively low-cost 
onboard storage applications in which extreme radiation hardness is important. 
CD-ROMs alone can be used to make very large amounts of reference in- 
formation available to the onboard computer, allowing much greater autonomy 
in spacecraft operations, while CD-RW devices add a reprogramming capability 
to the mix of design choices. However, as of this writing, the authors are unaware 
of any space applications of compact disk technology. 
1 1.5.8 Modulation Methods 
The modulation scheme is the nlethod by which command and telemetry 
systems encode a "baseband" information-bearing signal upon an RF carrier. The 
carrier, S(t), is an RF signal characterized as 
where A is the amplitude, o the frequency, and C#I the phase angle of the signal. 
All of these quantities can vary as a function of time. Three modulation schemes 
are commonly used. AM varies the amplitude of the RF carrier wave signal 
according to the baseband signal. FM varies the w of the carrier according to the 
baseband signal. Both of these schemes are in common use in terrestrial radio 
systems. The third scheme, PM, varies the r$ with the baseband signal. 
All three modulation schemes offer particular advantages, some touched on 
briefly in the section on command. The selection of the best method will depend 
on the application, available bandwidth, required signal-to-noise ratio, and the 
capability of the ground stations. However, it is true that few modem com- 
munications systems employ amplitude modulation. 
Both analog and digital input signals may be used with any of the three 
methods. Discrete amplitude changes, frequency shifts, or phase shifts can 
represent the Is and 0s of digital data. Similarly, continuous changes in amplitude,

overwhelming choice for mass memory storage on spacecraft is solid-state

11.5.8 Modulation Methods

The modulation scheme is the method by which command and telemetry
systems encode a “baseband” information-bearing signal upon an RF carrier. The
carrier, S(), is an RF signal characterized as

S(t) = A(t) cos[o(t)t + A(t)] (11.1)

where A is the amplitude, w the frequency, and ¢ the phase angle of the signal.
All of these quantities can vary as a function of time. Three modulation schemes
are commonly used. AM varies the amplitude of the RF carrier wave signal
according to the baseband signal. FM varies the @ of the carrier according to the
baseband signal. Both of these schemes are in common use in terrestrial radio
systems. The third scheme, PM, varies the @ with the baseband signal.

All three modulation schemes offer particular advantages, some touched on
briefly in the section on command. The selection of the best method will depend
on the application, available bandwidth, required signal-to-noise ratio, and the
capability of the ground stations. However, it is true that few modern com-
munications systems employ amplitude modulation.

Both analog and digital input signals may be used with any of the three
methods. Discrete amplitude changes, frequency shifts, or phase shifts can
represent the Is and Os of digital data. Similarly, continuous changes in amplitude,

528 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
frequency, or phase can represent an analog signal. Modem systems use digital 
modulation almost exclusively. However, there may be cases in which analog 
modulation offers advantages (e.g., with high bandwidth video data). 
Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a technique for converting analog signals 
into digital form rather than a fundamental modulation method such as AM, FM, 
or PM. PCM samples the signal and quantizes it into one of 2" levels at a sample 
rate appropriate to the application. Because the allowed 2" levels are finite, the 
unique level of each sample can be represented by a digital word n bits long. 
These data words are then formed into a serial bit stream arranged in minor 
frames that in turn make up major frames, as discussed earlier. Figure 11.7 
diagrams the process of converting from the original analog waveform to the final 
digital bit stream. 
This digital bit stream varies, or "keys," the camer signal by one of the 
methods discussed earlier. If each bit is encoded onto the carrier independent of 
the other bits in the bit stream, the digital modulation is called binary. In binary 
amplitude-shift keying (BASK), the amplitude of the basic signal is varied to 
represent a 1 or a 0. (Morse code is a simple example of BASK.) In bin* 
frequency-shift keying (BFSK), two frequencies, close to but distinct from the 
camer, represent the 1 and 0. This may be accomplished, for example, by 
switching between the outputs of two crystal oscillators, one just above and the 
other just below the basic frequency. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) transmits 
a sinusoidal carrier with one of two allowable phases that represent a 1 or a 0. Of 
these three techniques BPSK and BFSK are the most common in space 
communications. 
If often seems to the casual observer that there are as many digital coding 
schemes as there are practitioners of the art. Figure 11.8 shows eight common 
approaches. The system engineer, unless specifically involved in coding

11.6.1 Antennas and Gain

Antennas are generally categorized as omnidirectional (omni) or directional.
The latter come in a variety of types, with beamwidths ranging from a few tenths
to several tens of degrees. The beamwidth of a directional antenna is defined as
the angle between the ~—3 dB (half-power) points relative to the power on the
boresight axis. Figure 11.10 shows this and other beam characteristics.

The gain of a directional antenna relates the power on the boresight axis to that
of an ideal isotropic radiator, a point source that radiates energy equally in all
directions. The gain of an isotropic radiator is 0 dB. An antenna with gain gathers

The term [~/(4?r~)]~ is known as the path loss. This is not an absorption 
loss, but rather a "dilution" of the transmitted energy as the wavefront expands 
in traveling toward the receiver. In terms of the path loss, the received power 
will be 
P, = EZRP x G,/path loss (11.14) 
Path losses of some 200 dB characterize links between Earth stations and 
geosynchronous satellites. As a result, high-gain antennas, low-noise receivers, 
and careful selection of modulation method and bandwidth are required to 
achieve acceptable signal-to-noise ratios over that long link. Large path loss is a 
distinctive feature of space communication systems. 
Several other loss mechanisms may be present as well. These additional losses 
are included with the path loss in the previous equation to arrive at the overall 
received signal power. 
Multipath loss occurs when copies of the signal arrive at the receiving antenna 
after being reflected to the receiver off other objects. Because these signals have 
traveled a greater distance, they arrive after the main signal and may interfere 
destructively or appear as noise. Many readers will recall the most common 
example of such interference in the form of television "ghosts" caused by 
reflection of the signal from nearby mountains, overflying aircraft, or other large 
objects. Such ghosts have essentially been relegated to the status of ancient 
memories, at least since the mid-1990s, when commercial television stations 
began including a ghost cancellation reference, or GCR, in analog television 
broadcasts, to allow the receiver to distinguish between the direct-path signal and 
its later-arriving doppelgangers. More modem digital television broadcasts 
include frame synchronization information that similarly allows accomplishment 
of the task of identifying the direct-path signal. 
Faraday rotation is a problem for linearly polarized signals. As the linearly 
polarized electromagnetic field of the RF signal penetrates the Earth's magnetic 
field, it is rotated as shown in Fig. 1 1.13. Any rotation between the polarization 
direction of the antenna and that of the incoming signal causes a loss that can 
become very large as the rotation approaches 90°, as shown in Fig. 11.13. This 
problem can be avoided in space applications by using circular polarization. 
Thus, one often sees helical antennas for I-IF/VHF/UHF links and cruciform 
antennas for X-band in low- and mid-gain applications.

Note that most of these concerns do not apply for spacecraft-to-spacecraft

538 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
Strictly speaking, noise is any received power that interferes with the desired 
signal, a definition that includes many things that could be "signals" to other 
users. Spacecraft communications engineers and radio astronomers have 
fundamentally differing views about which electromagnetic waves constitute 
signal and which constitute noise. The principal figure of merit used to specify the 
quality of a communications link is the ratio of signal power to noise power, 
the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR. Interfering signals aside, most noise is of 
thermal origin, either from blackbody emission as discussed in Chapter 9, 
or from thermally induced motion of electrons in the receiver circuitry, referred 
to as Johnson noise. Noise that is not thermally generated will usually be 
approximated in its effects by assuming that it is thermally induced, as we will 
discuss later. 
As an aside, it should be noted that the discussion in this section is relevant 
only for information transmission at conventional radio frequencies. Optical 
communications links are becoming quite common in space applications, both 
internally to the spacecraft and between vehicles. Thermal noise is not typically 
important in optical and electro-optieal communications systems, which are 
dominated by shot noise, quantum noise, or the optical interference background, 
depending on the wavelength and system characteristics. 
Electrons in receiver circuits are thermally agitated when the circuits operate 
above 0 K. This motion causes a random voltage or current to be induced in all

the collective output of a multitude of individual oscillators. The central limit 
theorem of statistics thus guarantees the noise to be Gaussian, i.e., the noise 
power per unit frequency interval at any given instant will have a level drawn 
from a normal distribution, characterized by a mean No and a standard deviation 
u. If No is constant across all frequencies (always an idealization, since this 
implies infinite total energy content in the noise), then the noise is called white,

(WGN) is the standard assumption in communications link analysis.

Strictly speaking, noise is any received power that interferes with the desired
signal, a definition that includes many things that could be “signals” to other
users. Spacecraft communications engineers and radio astronomers have
fundamentally differing views about which electromagnetic waves constitute
signal and which constitute noise. The principal figure of merit used to specify the
quality of a communications link is the ratio of signal power to noise power,
the signal-to-noise ratio, or SNR. Interfering signals aside, most noise is of
thermal origin, either from blackbody emission as discussed in Chapter 9,
or from thermally induced motion of electrons in the receiver circuitry, referred
to as Johnson noise. Noise that is not thermally generated will usually be
approximated in its effects by assuming that it is thermally induced, as we will
discuss later.

AS an aside, it should be noted that the discussion in this section is relevant
only for information transmission at conventional radio frequencies. Optical
communications links are becoming quite common in space applications, both
internally to the spacecraft and between vehicles. Thermal noise is not typically
important in optical and electro-optical communications systems, which are
dominated by shot noise, quantum noise, or the optical interference background,
depending on the wavelength and system characteristics.

Electrons in receiver circuits are thermally agitated when the circuits operate
above 0 K. This motion causes a random voltage or current to be induced in all
portions of the circuit. Subject to the assumption that we are operating at radio
frequencies with circuits of moderate temperature (at least a few tens of Kelvins),
the noise power from a given device in a given bandwidth interval may be
approximated by

Py = kIB (11.15)

where Py is the noise power (in W), k is the Boltzmann constant
(1.38 x 10773 Ws/K), 7 is the device temperature in Kelvins, and B is the
bandwidth interval.

A few comments are in order. T is referred to as the effective noise
temperature of the device and is commonly used as a figure of merit in
characterizing noise performance in a communications system. With the agitated
electron conceptual model discussed earlier, the total noise power will be due to
the collective output of a multitude of individual oscillators. The central limit
theorem of statistics thus guarantees the noise to be Gaussian, i.e., the noise
power per unit frequency interval at any given instant will have a level drawn
from a normal distribution, characterized by a mean No and a standard deviation
o. If No is constant across all frequencies (always an idealization, since this
implies infinite total energy content in the noise), then the noise is called white,
by analogy to white light as an equal mixture of all colors. White Gaussian noise
(WGN) is the standard assumption in communications link analysis.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 539 
As indicated earlier, the WGN assumption cannot ever be strictly correct. 
Nonetheless, receiving system bandwidths are normally quite small with 
respect to the frequency scale over which No varies significantly. Thus, 
the WGN assumption with constant noise power spectral density No given 
by 
is normally quite good. The utility of this concept is so great that communica- 
tions engineers commonly characterize even highly colored (e-g., nonthermal) 
noise by an equivalent "noise temperature." This would be selected to yield a 
white noise power level comparable in its effects to that of the actual colored 
noise. 
Noise in the communications link is not limited to that generated in the 
receiver circuitry. As we discussed in Chapter 9, any object with a temperature 
above 0 K emits electromagnetic radiation distributed across all wavelengths 
according to Planck's law, Eq. (9.15) (modified, of course, by the fact that no 
surface is ideally "black"). Though blackbody noise is highly colored, it is again 
modeled in its effect on communications systems by assuming WGN at an 
equivalent temperature, usually that of the blackbody spectral peak. Thus, the sun 
typically acts as a noise source at approximately 5780 K. Table 11.3 shows 
effective noise temperatures for several potential sources. Figure 11.15 depicts 
the combined effect of common noise sources as a function of frequency and for 
several elevation angles. 
The cursory discussion here can only touch on the subject of noise modeling 
for space communication links. Reference 4 provides an exhaustive discussion of 
environmental noise effects on the JPL Deep Space Network (DSN) and may also

As we have indicated, the SNR is the fundamental quantity characterizing the
quality of a communications link. This is because the data rate, or channel
capacity, of the link is directly related to the SNR. The fundamental theory of
communication in the presence of noise was developed by Shannon; all
subsequent work in the field is an extension of his efforts. According to
Shannon’s theorem, the error-free channel capacity of a link is given by

C = Blog, (1 + SNR) (11.30)

where C is the channel capacity in bps, and B is the link bandwidth in Hz.
(Usually the data rate in bps will be specified; this is approximately equal to the
required link bandwidth in Hz.) Thus, if we consider a standard C-band

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 545 
communications satellite transponder with a nominal bandwidth of 36 MHz and 
assume SNR = 15, the theoretical channel capacity is C = 144 Mbps. In actual 
practice, such a transponder could handle one color television signal or 1200 
voice links6 Each voice channel is assigned a nominal 56 kbps data rate, 
adequate for normal speech, and so the link carries a total data rate of 67 Mbps. 
This is less than 50% of the channel capacity promised by Shannon's error-free 
limit, and the satellite link will still contain some bit errors, typically on the order 
of one in a million. 
This simple example illustrates some important points with respect to 
Shannon's theorem. The theorem tells us what the limit is but not how to reach 
it. Today's satellite communications links employ very sophisticated coding tech- 
niques to achieve their capacity. Presumably even more complex techniques can 
be found to increase channel capacity, but Shannon's theorem gives no clue. 
Equation (1 1.30) gives the limit for error-free transmission, but says nothing 
about how system performance, i-e., bit error rate (BER), degrades as the limit is 
exceeded. Real systems degrade is shown in Fig. 11.19, which plots bit error rate 
as a function of, essentially, SNR. The analysis leading to this result is beyond the

A simple example of a space-to-space communications link analysis is 
presented in Table 11.4. For pedagogical reasons, comments are supplied in 
somewhat more detail than is usual, so that the reader may apply the principles to 
other cases of interest. To interpret the example properly, we must first recast 
some of the preceding results into the conventional terminology of the 
communications engineer. We begin by considering again the signal-to-noise 
ratio for the gain-gain case of.Eq. (1 1.29), which we rewrite slightly as 
It will be more convenient to express this relationship in decibel form, 
which has the advantage of reducing all subsequent calculations to simple 
addition and subtraction, as well as eliminating numerous large-magnitude 
exponents. In what follows, we assume reference values of a single Watt, Hertz, 
meter, etc., where necessary, i.e., everywhere dimensioned quantities are 
employed. 
Let us now consider a simple space-to-space communications example, such 
as might apply in the case of a rendezvous operation. We assume the target 
vehicle is equipped with a 401.5 MHz UHF data link operating at 57.6 kbps and 
intended to be acquired by the chase vehicle at a distance of 100 krn. The chase 
vehicle is equipped with a receiver that offers a BER, provided the input 
SNR is at least 11.5 dB. The target vehicle uses a 5-W transmitter and an antenna 
with approximately hemispherical coverage, but offering a gain of - 8 dB 
relative to isotropic. The chase vehicle receiver is not of especially high 
performance, having a system noise temperature of 600 K and a boresight gain of 
only 2 dB. Because of the requirement to orient the chase vehicle according to the 
dictates of the rendezvous maneuvers, it cannot be guaranteed that the antenna 
will be pointed directly at the target vehicle at all times, so that even though the 
antenna has a fairly broad beamwidth, we assume worst-case operation at the 
half-power point of the pattern. As a matter of routine conservative practice, 
transmit and receive efficiency factors of 0.5 are assumed. In addition, line losses 
of 2 dB in the received signal path are assumed. The question confronting the 
communications engineer is, can the desired link be closed, and if so, with what 
margin? Table 11.4 provides the answer; even with fairly conservative 
assumptions such as we have employed here, a "link margin" in excess of 6 dB 
over the requirement is found to exist.

which has the advantage of reducing all subsequent calculations to simple
addition and subtraction, as well as eliminating numerous large-magnitude
exponents. In what follows, we assume reference values of a single Watt, Hertz,
meter, etc., where necessary, i.e., everywhere dimensioned quantities are
employed.

Let us now consider a simple space-to-space communications example, such
as might apply in the case of a rendezvous operation. We assume the target
vehicle is equipped with a 401.5 MHz UHF data link operating at 57.6 kbps and
intended to be acquired by the chase vehicle at a distance of 100 km. The chase
vehicle is equipped with a receiver that offers a 10° BER, provided the input
SNR is at least 11.5 dB. The target vehicle uses a 5-W transmitter and an antenna
with approximately hemispherical coverage, but offering a gain of — 8 dB
relative to isotropic. The chase vehicle receiver is not of especially high
performance, having a system noise temperature of 600 K and a boresight gain of
only 2 dB. Because of the requirement to orient the chase vehicle according to the
dictates of the rendezvous maneuvers, it cannot be guaranteed that the antenna
will be pointed directly at the target vehicle at all times, so that even though the
antenna has a fairly broad beamwidth, we assume worst-case operation at the
half-power point of the pattern. As a matter of routine conservative practice,
transmit and receive efficiency factors of 0.5 are assumed. In addition, line losses
of 2 dB in the received signal path are assumed. The question confronting the
communications engineer is, can the desired link be closed, and if so, with what

margin? Table 11.4 provides the answer; even with fairly conservative’

assumptions such as we have employed here, a “link margin” in excess of 6 dB
over the requirement is found to exist.

11.7 Spacecraft Tracking

Ground-based tracking stations were at one time the sole means of fulfilling
three crucial functions: receiving spacecraft telemetry and routing it to the control
center for processing and distribution; uplinking commands from the control
center to the spacecraft; and obtaining Doppler range-rate data and spacecraft
azimuth and elevation necessary for orbit determination. Not all stations
necessarily had all these functions; some might perform tracking or data
reception only. However, this was, and in many cases remains, the general case.

The technology of spacecraft tracking systems underwent a major revolution
beginning in the early 1990s with the routine use of the Tracking and Data Relay
Satellite System (TDRSS) instead of an extensive network of ground stations for
major programs, i.e., shuttle, International Space Station, Hubble Space
Telescope, etc. This trend continued beginning in the mid-1990s with the
implementation of global positioning system (GPS) navigation receivers directly
onboard spacecraft and launch vehicles. With these two systems, it is now at least
technically possible to communicate with essentially any Earth orbiting
spacecraft via TDRSS, and to allow the spacecraft or launch vehicle to

determine its own position and to relay this to ground control via TDRSS. Such 
an approach obviates the need for much of the preexisting ground tracking 
infrastructure. 
However, as we will discuss, TDRSS and GPS, together or separately, are not 
useful for all Earth-orbiting spacecraft, and in any case there remains the problem 
of tracking and communicating with interplanetary missions. Also, if onboard 
GPS is used but TDRSS is not, then it remains necessary to be able to track the 
spacecraft at least well enough to establish communication, after which more 
accurate state vectors can be supplied by the spacecraft. For these reasons, it will 
perhaps be useful to consider older systems. 
Spacecraft uplink and downlink operations have been supported by various 
networks and individual stations in S-band (2-4 GHz), C-band (4-6 GHz), X- 
band (7-9 GHz), Ku-band (12- 14 GHz), and Ka-band (20-30GHz). Some 
older systems still use UHF frequencies in the 400-MHz band. Numerous U.S. 
government tracking stations are spaced throughout the world as part of various 
networks, including the following: 
1) NASA Space Network (SN, formerly Tracking and Data Relay Satellite 
System, or TDRSS); 
2) NASA Ground Network (formerly Space Tracking and Data Network, or 
STDN); 
3) NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory Deep Space Network @SN); 
4) USAF Space Ground Link System (SGLS); 
5) North American Air Defense Command Space Data Acquisition and Tracking 
System (NORAD SPADATS). 
It is worth noting that the various systems are generally not compatible with 
one another; for example, a C-band radar for the NASA SN will not function 
within the SGLS network. 
Though it is true that these networks are still comprised of "numerous" 
stations, it is equally true that they are not as numerous as in earlier decades. The 
advent of TDRSS has, especially for larger spacecraft or those returning large 
quantities of data (e.g., Hubble Space Telescope, the space shuttle, etc.), has 
resulted in the diminution of importance of many individual ground stations. 
11.7.1 NASA Space Network 
As this is written, the NASA Space Network is comprised of the TDRSS 
constellation, plus associated ground facilities at White Sands, New Mexico, and 
on Guam, in the western Pacific. The TDRSS constellation consists of nine large 
satellites in geostationary orbit that relay data between low-orbit satellites and the 
ground, thus eliminating the problem of long communication gaps for such 
spacecraft. Of these, three are of the so-called enhanced variety, launched in the 
early 2000s, and six are of the original design, some of which have been in 
service for nearly 20 years.

550 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
The original six TDRSS spacecraft support single- and multiple-access S-band 
and Ku-band communications. One of the significant enhancements in the new 
series is the addition of a steerable single-access Ka-band mtenna, intended to 
provide high data rate support, including high-definition television (HDTV), to 
the shuttle and International Space Station programs. 
The primary ground link with TDRSS is the White Sands Complex (WSC), 
with both primary and backup capabilities [White Sands Ground Terminal 
(WSGT) and Second TDRSS Ground Terminal (STGT)]. Additional capability, 
including direct communication with those satellites not in view from White 
Sands, is provided by the Guam   emote Ground Terminal (GRGT). To use 
TDRSS, the host spacecraft must, in general, carry its own state vector (so that it 
can find a TDRSS spacecraft) and must have a steerable antenna to allow in-flight 
tracking of TDRSS. 
As noted, this system has essentially replaced the former utility of the STDN 
and SGLS networks for some programs. However, TDRSS is not well suited to 
support smaller satellites that cannot carry the rather cumbersome equipment 
necessary. TDRSS may also be inappropriate even for larger, but relatively low 
cost, spacecraft, simply because the equipment for the TDRSS link would 
comprise too great a portion of the overall spacecraft cost to be justified. Finally, 
use of TDRSS may be technically unjustified for spacecraft returning a relatively 
low volume of data. 
These examples aside, however, TDRSS is admirably suited to support larger, 
more complex spacecraft and programs. Figure 11.20 shows the TDRSS concept,

11.7.5 Commercial Networks 
1 1.7.6 Tracking Accuracy I It should be noted that by the late 1990s numerous commercially sponsored 
space programs had come into existence. For these programs, the difficulty of 
obtaining priority access to government tracking networks (if indeed access could 
be obtained at all), the associated cost of using such stations, and the often- 
cumbersome technical interface requirements of so doing, mitigated strongly 
against any involvement with the existing government networks. Accordingly, 
the Orbcornm, Iridium, and Globalstar LEO communications networks, as well 
as the Space Imaging, Digital Globe, and OrbIrnage commercial imaging 
constellations, and others, all developed their own network of ground stations. 
Numerous small scientific satellite programs, even though sponsored by I 
government organizations, have done so as well, though to a lesser degree than 
the commercial ventures. 
Modem desktop computer workstation technology, together with the general 
improvement in and reduction in cost of receivers, transmitters, and antenna I systems, has rendered this a practical choice in many cases. Further, as we will 
see in Section 11.7.7, the use of GPS to provide highly accurate onboard 
navigation implies that precision tracking is no longer a required ground station 
function, reducing historical costs even further. 
The choice of a given system, and indeed the issue of whether to build or buy 
tracking capability, will usually be driven by the sponsor and the mission and will 
have strong implications for the system engineering process. 
In addition to their role in receiving spacecraft telemetry and providing a 
channel for command and data uplinks, tracking stations can be (and formerly 
were required to be) used to supply position and velocity data needed for the orbit 
determination algorithms discussed in Chapter 4 and detailed in common 
references such as Bate et al? or   at tin.'' The accuracy of the resulting orbit and 
the ability to propagate the estimated orbit forward in time are ultimately limited 
by the tracking precision. For this reason it is instructive to consider state-of-the- 
art tracking system precision with respect to position and velocity determination 
and prediction. 
Figure 11.24 shows a typical position estimate for a low Earth orbiting satellite 
as a function of time as reconstructed from a tracking data file. The emphasis on 
reconstruction is deliberate; note that the actual measurements are made at 
sporadically indicated times. These offer the greatest accuracy, on the order of 10 
m for all three velocity components (selected here to be radial, in-track, and 
cross-track). In between the actual measurements, the ability of interpolation 
algorithms to specify precisely the spacecraft location grows poorer, reaching a 
maximum halfway between data points. Figure 11.25 shows similar behavior for 
reconstructed velocity. I

obtaining priority access to government tracking networks (if indeed access could
be obtained at all), the associated cost of using such stations, and the often-
cumbersome technical interface requirements of so doing, mitigated strongly
against any involvement with the existing government networks. Accordingly,
the Orbcomm, Iridium, and GlobalStar LEO communications networks, as well
as the Space Imaging, Digital Globe, and OrbImage commercial imaging
constellations, and others, all developed their own network of ground stations.
Numerous small scientific satellite programs, even though sponsored by
government organizations, have done so as well, though to a lesser degree than
the commercial ventures.

Modern desktop computer workstation technology, together with the general
improvement in and reduction in cost of receivers, transmitters, and antenna
systems, has rendered this a practical choice in many cases. Further, as we will
see in Section 11.7.7, the use of GPS to provide highly accurate onboard
navigation implies that precision tracking is no longer a required ground station
function, reducing historical costs even further.

The choice of a given system, and indeed the issue of whether to build or buy
tracking capability, will usually be driven by the sponsor and the mission and will
have strong implications for the system engineering process.

11.7.6 Tracking Accuracy

In addition to their role in receiving spacecraft telemetry and providing a
channel for command and data uplinks, tracking stations can be (and formerly
were required to be) used to supply position and velocity data needed for the orbit
determination algorithms. discussed in Chapter 4 and detailed in common
references such as Bate et al.” or Battin.!° The accuracy of the resulting orbit and
the ability to propagate the estimated orbit forward in time are ultimately limited
by the tracking precision. For this reason it is instructive to consider state-of-the-
art tracking system precision with respect to position and velocity determination
and prediction.

Figure 11.24 shows a typical position estimate for a low Earth orbiting satellite
as a function of time as reconstructed from a tracking data file. The emphasis on
reconstruction is deliberate; note that the actual measurements are made at
sporadically indicated times. These offer the greatest accuracy, on the order of 10
m for all three velocity components (selected here to be radial, in-track, and
cross-track). In between the actual measurements, the ability of interpolation
algorithms to specify precisely the spacecraft location grows poorer, reaching a
maximum halfway between data points. Figure 11.25 shows similar behavior for
reconstructed velocity.

to the specialist in this field, a brief description of the system and the 
fundamentals of its operation may be of value. Smctly speaking, of course, GPS 
is not a "tracking" system at all. Rather, as we shall see, it is a system designed to 
allow a properly equipped Earth-orbiting spacecraft to determine accurately its 
state vector (r, V). This information can then be telemetered to the appropriate 
ground control center (possibly via TDRSS), eliminating the need for the tracking 
station to perform such a function. As already noted, if the spacecraft is to be 
tracked directly from the ground, then at least coarse state vector information 
must be available, for example from orbit injection conditions at launch vehicle 
separation, but usually this is not a difficult problem. 
The GPS constellation is nominally comprised of 24 satellites, with four 
satellites in each of six circular Earth orbits, at altitudes of 20,335 km and 
inclinations of 55 deg, with the six orbital planes spaced equally in their 
ascending node locations. The chosen altitude provides two complete satellite 
revolutions per sidereal day, with between 6 and 11 spacecraft always in view 
above the horizon from any location on Earth. Only 21 operational spacecraft are 
required to guarantee full system performance, so that three may be viewed as on- 
orbit spares. (As this is written, the constellation actually contains 27 working 
spacecraft, with 10 of these having experienced degradation of some subsystems, 
rendering them "one failure away" in those subsystems from loss of mission.) 
Each spacecraft has a very accurately known ephemeris and carries a very 
precise atomic clock, stable to one part in 1013 or better and synchronized via 
ground control with all other satellites, comprising what is known as "system 
time." The spacecraft continually broadcasts timing and ephemeris information 
on a set of L-band signals. 
Let us assume that a satellite S1 broadcasts from known position vector R1 in 
Earth-centered inertial coordinates at system time tsl. A receiver with a clock 
synchronized to system time is positioned at unknown position vector R and 
receives the signal at time t,~. Then the receiver-to-satellite range r~ can be 
written as 
rl = IR - Rll = c(trl - tsl) (1 1.33a) 
Similarly, receipt of signals from satellites S2 and S3 allows us to write ! 
and I 
The system of Eqs. (1 1.33) is sufficient to solve for the three unknown 
components of receiver position vector R, provided again that the receiver clock 
is accurately synchionized to system time and neglecting various other errors 
including relativistic effects, atmospheric refraction, the change in the speed of 
light within the atmosphere as opposed to free space, etc.

precise atomic clock, stable to one part in 10’? or better and synchronized via
ground control with all other satellites, comprising what is known as “system
time.” The spacecraft continually broadcasts timing and ephemeris information
on a set of L-band signals.

Let us assume that a satellite 5, broadcasts from known position vector R, in
Earth-centered inertial coordinates at system time f,;. A receiver with a clock
synchronized to system time is positioned at unknown position vector R and
receives the signal at time t,;. Then the receiver-to-satellite range r,; can be
written as

ry = |R—-R,| = c(t — ts1) (11.33a)
Similarly, receipt of signals from satellites S, and S3 allows us to write

r2 = |R — Ro| = c(t — ta) (11.33b)
and

r3 = |R — R3| = c(t — ts3) (11.33c)

The system of Eqs. (11.33) is sufficient to solve for the three unknown
components of receiver position vector R, provided again that the receiver clock
is accurately synchronized to system time and neglecting various other errors
including relativistic effects, atmospheric refraction, the change in the speed of
light within the atmosphere as opposed to free space, etc.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS 559 
In practice, the receiver clock cannot normally be well synchronized with the 
-satellite clocks (atomic clocks not being in common use) but will be offset by an 
unknown bias, which for the present discussion we assume to be constant over the 
course of the measurement interval. The determination of times tsl through ts3 
will be in error by the amount of this bias, at, resulting in substantially degraded 
estimates of R. However, use of a fourth (otherwise redundant) satellite signal 
allows the clock bias to be determined together with the components of the 
location vector, thus completing the solution. 
In this discussion, we treat the navigation problem deterministically, i.e., we 
assume that there exist four unknown quantities, R and St, and that we seek four 
equations to allow their determination. In practice, the techniques of optimal 
estimation theory are used to provide a "best guess" as to the unknown quantities, 
using as many measurements as can be obtained. Modem GPS receivers can 
handle essentially simultaneous receipt of signals from up to a dozen satellites 
(e.g., all that are in view) and can appropriately weight the additional information 
to obtain an optimal position estimate given all available data. Additional 
filtering allows estimation of velocity information as well, so that a full state 
vector can be computed at the receiver. The details of actual system 
implementation can become extremely complex, especially when great precision 
is desired, but this is the essence of the method. 
Despite its origins within and continued maintenance by the U.S. Department 
of Defense, GPS has become a de facto global public utility. As this is written, 
military use in fact comprises less than 2% of all GPS use; automotive navigation 
by itself accounts for over a third of such use.13 High quality portable navigation 
systems costing $100-1000 are available for private and recreational uses 
including hunting, boating, aviation, golf, and of course automobile routing. 
Commercial and scientific applications include heavy equipment and shipping 
container tracking, surveying, geodesy, and an expanding host of other uses. 
Concerns over the dependence of GPS on U.S. military policy and operations 
have led to a European proposal for a similar but independent system, to be called 
Galileo . 
The Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) operates in a 
fashion quite similar to that of the U.S. GPS; however, its performance is 
substantially degraded at present because of numerous satellite failures and the 
lack of Russian budgetary resources adequate to maintain the constellation. Still, 
several GPS receiver manufacturers make available surveying equipment 
offering dual-system capability. When high precision is required, inclusion of 
additional satellites in the measurement base improves the quality of the "fix," 
and so the ability to incorporate any functioning GLONASS satellites is helpful.

(which lack access to the most accurate timing signals) provide a position fix to

10 m. However, on a local or regional scale, very high accuracy, on the order of 
centimeters, is possible through the use of differential GPS (DGPS). The succ6ss 
of this concept relies upon the knowledge that most GPS errors, whether 
environmental or system-induced, are essentially the same across any area that is 
using basically the same group of satellites to determine a position fix. It is 
possible to determine these systematic errors by obtaining a GPS position 
measurement at a carefully surveyed known reference point in the desired area. 
Any deviation (which likely is time varying) of the GPS measurement from the 
known reference coordinates is therefore the result of the systematic errors, 
which now become known to the accuracy with which the reference position is 
known. These errors can in turn be broadcast locally and used by any suitably 
equipped GPS receiver in the area to correct its own measurements. As always, 
complications beyond the scope of this text remain to be explored, but the basic 
approach is easily implemented and quite useful. 
As is always the case when space vehicle applications are considered, the use 
of GPS in space systems has lagged behind, imd comes at a considerably greater 
cost, than its ground-based applications. Complicating factors include, of course, 
the higher level of environmental stress and parts qualification required. We have 
discussed these issues previously and need not comment further on them. With 
GPS, however, an additional difficulty arises in that the basic technical problem 
becomes substantially more difficult for space and missile guidance than for 
typical ground applications. 
Most space vehicle applications will require determination of a full six- 
element state vector, i-e., position and velocity. The GPS system approach, as 
described, fundamentally allows a given user to determine only his position. 
Velocity is not directly measured, but must be inferred, basically by 
differentiating a series of position measurements. This is an inherently noisy 
process, requiring a higher level of estimator sophistication to achieve than when 
only position is required. Moreover, the fact of a receiver in motion at high 
velocity by itself impedes the convergence of the position estimator. The net 
result is that, in many respects, higher quality receivers are needed to perform 
GPS navigation for high-dynamics applications than otherwise, and space and 
missile systems are among the most demanding of these. In fact, for these 
reasons, GPS is more commonly used in space vehicle applications as an aid to, 
rather than as the sole means of, navigation. Often the GPS data will be used in 
concert with onboard inertial navigation, which is much better suited to the high- 
dynamics environment. 
An additional complexity associated with the use of GPS on atmospheric entry 
vehicles such as the space shuttle is the requirement to cope with intermittent loss 
of signal as a result of the ionized plasma sheath that is generated during high- 
speed atmospheric flight. The shuttle encounters periods of degraded GPS 
performance for up to several minutes during entry flight, from about 100 km to 
80 km altitude, with some effects persisting down to about 60 km.I4 Unaided

GPS receiver systems flown on the shuttle on an experimental basis have so far 
been unable to maintain continuous tracking throughout this phase of flight.15 
Table 11.6 provides performance parameters achievable, as this is written, by 
spacecraft-quality GPS navigation devices. The terminology "SA off' refers to a 
"selective availability," a DoD-enabled feature that "dithers" the signal to 
prevent maximum accuracy being attained by other than military users in the 
event of a conflict. The "cold start" acquisition time refers to the case in which the 
unit is activated but has no initial position fix. The more typical in-flight situation 
is the "warm start," wherein the GPS must reacquire a state vector following a 
maneuver, a computer reset, or other event that upsets the state vector estimate, 
but allows use of recent values as a starting point for a new solution. 
Space systems applications of GPS are only now developing beyond 
straightforward use of the navigation state vector (r, V). Even here, the full suite 
of possibilities is only gradually emerging. In the immediately foreseeable future, 
it is reasonable to suppose that the use of tracking stations for spacecraft and 
launch vehicle operations, at least for those in Earth orbit, and for range safety 
assessment will become obsolete. The spacecraft or launch vehicle itself will 
know its navigation state to within a few tens of meters and can telemeter this 
information to the ground. If range safety constraints are violated, the vehicle can 
be programmed to destroy itself. It will be a matter of careful engineering design 
to ensure adequate redundancy in such systems, but the economic benefits would 
seem to ensure that ultimately it will be done. 
As mentioned in Chapter 7, it is also possible to use GPS for spacecraft 
attitude determination. Indeed, for large spacecraft (because of the lengthy 
baseline between separate antennas) it is almost trivial and may well represent the 
cheapest alternative. The method has already been demonstrated on certain 
experimental unmanned aerial vehicles. Basically, the approach involves fixing 
several antennas to widely separated portions of the spacecraft. Knowing the 
spacecraft ephemeris, position differences between the various antennas are 
immediately convertible to spacecraft attitude angles.

GPS receiver systems flown on the shuttle on an experimental basis have so far
been unable to maintain continuous tracking throughout this phase of flight.!>

Table 11.6 provides performance parameters achievable, as this is written, by
spacecraft-quality GPS navigation devices. The terminology “SA off” refers to a
“selective availability,” a DoD-enabled feature that “dithers” the signal to
prevent maximum accuracy being attained by other than military users in the
event of a conflict. The “cold start” acquisition time refers to the case in which the
unit is activated but has no initial position fix. The more typical in-flight situation
is the “warm start,” wherein the GPS must reacquire a state vector following a
maneuver, a computer reset, or other event that upsets the state vector estimate,
but allows use of recent values as a starting point for a new solution.

Space systems applications of GPS are only now developing beyond
straightforward use of the navigation state vector (r, V). Even here, the full suite
of possibilities is only gradually emerging. In the immediately foreseeable future,
it is reasonable to suppose that the use of tracking stations for spacecraft and
launch vehicle operations, at least for those in Earth orbit, and for range safety
assessment will become obsolete. The spacecraft or launch vehicle itself will
know its navigation state to within a few tens of meters and can telemeter this
information to the ground. If range safety constraints are violated, the vehicle can
be programmed to destroy itself. It will be a matter of careful engineering design
to ensure adequate redundancy in such systems, but the economic benefits would
seem to ensure that ultimately it will be done.

As mentioned in Chapter 7, it is also possible to use GPS for spacecraft
attitude determination. Indeed, for large spacecraft (because of the lengthy
baseline between separate antennas) it is almost trivial and may well represent the
cheapest alternative. The method has already been demonstrated on certain
experimental unmanned aerial vehicles. Basically, the approach involves fixing
several antennas to widely separated portions of the spacecraft. Knowing the
spacecraft ephemeris, position differences between the various antennas are
immediately convertible to spacecraft attitude angles.

Reliability Analysis 
12.1 Introduction 
An important measure of the worth of any engineering system is its 
reliability, which we define as the probability that the system will function as 
expected. Space systems tend to be quite expensive as well as unusually complex 
and are not repairable other than in highly unusual circumstances, and so it is both 
extremely important and very difficult to ensure that a spacecraft is highly 
reliable. Attaining the desired degree of space vehicle reliability, and trading 
incremental improvements in reliability against incremental costs, is the overall 
responsibility of the spacecraft system engineer. As with other aspects of system 
design, he will be aided in this effort by a knowledgeable specialist, in this case a 
safety, reliability, and quality assurance (SR&QA) engineer. As one of the so- 
called "ilities" (including such disciplines as maintainability, producibility, and 
operability), reliability analysis often lacks the visibility associated with 
seemingly more prestigious specialties. However, the cost of unreliability, both 
in lives and property damage, can be far greater than that of a suboptimal, but 
generally workable, design in almost any other subsystem. 
In this chapter, we will develop an understanding of the tools and methods of 
reliability analysis and illustrate the use of these methods through the use of 
relatively simple examples. To do this, we begin with a treatment of the 
fundamentals of probability theory and the analysis of random variables. With 
these tools, the system engineer will be equipped to deal with the most covon 
features of engineering reliability analysis. However, we offer the caution that, 
within the scope of this text, we can provide only the briefest outline of this very 
rich branch of mathematics. The interested reader is referred to more 
comprehensive works.'-3

A. While this latter topic is not strictly germane to the subject of reliability

An important measure of the worth of any engineering system is its
reliability, which we define as the probability that the system will function as

in lives and property damage, can be far greater than that of a suboptimal, but

In this chapter, we will develop an understanding of the tools and methods of

relatively simple examples. To do this, we begin with a treatment of the
fundamentals of probability theory and the analysis of random variables. With
these tools, the system engineer will be equipped to deal with the most common

12.2 Review of Probability Theory 
Most people, including most engineers, freely employ the language of I 
probability and statistical theory in everyday conversation without considering 
the rigorously correct definitions of these terms. Thus, we commonly refer to 
"random" failures and speak casually of the "probability" of such events 
occurring. We possess, or at least believe that we possess, an intuitive I 
understanding of the meaning of such terms that is sufficient for many purposes. 
This is indeed fortunate, because -substantial mathematical sophistication is 
required to provide a rigorous definition of a random event or of the probability of 
such an event occurring. Most working definitions of the fundamental terms in 
probability theory are circular in the extreme, rooted in the very intuition that is I 
sought to be avoided through the use of mathematics. In this text, where the 
application of knowledge is more important than its strictly rigorous 
development, we will appeal to these intuitively acceptable concepts to ground 
our discussion. Where necessary, we will try to clarify the limits of applicability I 
of such concepts. 
In this spirit, we offer as the definition of a random event an experiment for 
which the outcome cannot be modeled by a cause-and-effect relationship. For our 
purposes, it is sufficient to ignore the differences between an event that appears 
random due to an observer's ignorance or computational limitations, and an event I 
whose underlying nature is intrinsically random, such as the outcome of a 
quantum experiment. 
Continuing, we define a sample space as the set of all possible outcomes of a 
random event. In the simple case of a coin toss (the random event), the sample 
space consists of the set of possible outcomes, heads or tails, provided that we 
believe it is impossible for the coin ever to come to rest on its edge. In set theory 
notation, we might write this as S = {H, 7). For the random event of rolling a 
single die, the sample space is S = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The sample space can be 
continuous as well as discrete. For example, if the random event is the 
measurement of the height of an adult human male, we might say that 
S = (h E 3, 2 ft < h < 10 ft), i.e., the height h is a real number in the range 
between 2 and 10 ft. A given sample space may be empty, i.e., it may consist of 
the null set, 0. 
We define the probability of an event through a set of axioms. We employ 
standard set-theory notation, with A U B denoting the union of sets A and B, and 
A n B their intersection. The notation A fl B is read ''A and B," while A U B is 
read "A or B." The "or" in this latter case is the inclusive or, meaning A or B or 
both. Figure 12.1 illustrates the concepts involved. 
The fundamental axioms of probability are: 
1) P(A) = probablity of an event A; 0 5 P(A) 5 1. Note that the event A 
may be defined as a group of several individual events, as, for example, the event 
of rolling either a 7 or 11 in the game of craps.

12.2 Review of Probability Theory

Most people, including most engineers, freely employ the language of
probability and statistical theory in everyday conversation without considering
the rigorously correct definitions of these terms. Thus, we commonly refer to
“random” failures and speak casually of the “probability” of such events
occurring. We possess, or at least believe that we possess, an intuitive {
understanding of the meaning of such terms that is sufficient for many purposes.

This is indeed fortunate, because substantial mathematical sophistication is

required to provide a rigorous definition of a random event or of the probability of

such an event occurring. Most working definitions of the fundamental terms in
probability theory are circular in the extreme, rooted in the very intuition that is '
sought to be avoided through the use of mathematics. In this text, where the

application of knowledge is more important than its strictly rigorous
development, we will appeal to these intuitively acceptable concepts to ground

our discussion. Where necessary, we will try to clarify the limits of applicability ‘
of such concepts.

In this spirit, we offer as the definition of a random event an experiment for
which the outcome cannot be modeled by a cause-and-effect relationship. For our
purposes, it is sufficient to ignore the differences between an event that appears
random due to an observer’s ignorance or computational limitations, and an event
whose underlying nature is intrinsically random, such as the outcome of a
quantum experiment.

Continuing, we define a sample space as the set of all possible outcomes of a
random event. In the simple case of a coin toss (the random event), the sample
space consists of the set of possible outcomes, heads or tails, provided that we
believe it is impossible for the coin ever to come to rest on its edge. In set theory
notation, we might write this as S = {H, 7}. For the random event of rolling a
single die, the sample space is S$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The sample space can be
continuous as well as discrete. For example, if the random event is the
measurement of the height of an adult human male, we might say that
S={hER, 2ft <h< 10ft}, ie., the height A is a real number in the range
between 2 and 10 ft. A given sample space may be empty, i.e., it may consist of
the null set, 0.

We define the probability of an event through a set of axioms. We employ
standard set-theory notation, with A U B denoting the union of sets A and B, and
A” B their intersection. The notation A M B is read “‘A and B,” while A U B is
read “A or B.” The “or” in this latter case is the inclusive or, meaning A or B or
both. Figure 12.1 illustrates the concepts involved.

The fundamental axioms of probability are:

1) P(A) = probablity of an event A;0 < P(A) < 1. Note that the event A
may be defined as a group of several individual events, as, for example, the event
of rolling either a 7 or 11 in the game of craps.

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS 
Fig. 12.1 Venn diagram for events A and B. 
2) P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) if and only if A n B = 0 (A and B are mutually 
,exclusive). 
3) P(S) = 1 (some outcome must occur). 
From these axioms one can deduce several basic theorems. For example, suppose 
that events A and B are not mutually exclusive, i.e., A n B # 0. Then 
P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B) (12.1) 
Further, if A and B are not mutually exclusive, then the knowledge that one event 
has occurred influences, or conditions, our expectation as to the probability of 
occurrence of the other event. We define 
P(A/B) = conditional probability of event A given 'that event B has occurred 
and we note P(A/B) = 0 if events A and B are mutually exclusive. Then, 
P(A n B) = P(A)P(B/A) = P(B)P(A/B) (12.2) 
If A and B are independent, it is clear that P(A/B) = P(A) and P(B/A) = P(B), 
hence 
P(A n B) = P(A)P(B) (independent events) (12.3) 
Now suppose there exists an event A that is dependent on several possible 
but mutually exclusive events B,, j E [I, N]. Then, using the preceding results on 
conditional probabilities, it can be shown that 
This is the Law of Conditional Probabilities. The simple example given in 
Example 12.1 may help to illustrate its utility in reliability analysis.

2) P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) if and only if AN B = @ (A and B are mutually
exclusive).
3) P(S) = 1 (some outcome must occur).

From these axioms one can deduce several basic theorems. For example, suppose
that events A and B are not mutually exclusive, i.c., ANB # @. Then

P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) — PCAN B) (12.1)
Further, if A and B are not mutually exclusive, then the knowledge that one event

has occurred influences, or conditions, our expectation as to the probability of
occurrence of the other event. We define

P(A/B) = conditional probability of event A given that event B has occurred

and we note P(A/B) = 0 if events A and B are mutually exclusive. Then,
P(A OB) = P(A)P(B/A) = P(B)P(A/B) (12.2)
If A and B are independent, it is clear that P(A/B) = P(A) and P(B/A) = P(B),
hence
P(A B) = P(A)P(B) (independent events) (12.3)
Now suppose there exists an event A that is dependent on several possible

but mutually exclusive events B;, j € [1, N]. Then, using the preceding results on
conditional probabilities, it can be shown that

Z Example 12.1 
A manned space launch system has a generic reliability, or probability of 1 
! success, of 0.98. An abort system for the crew module is provided and has a 
reliability of 0.95. What is the overall probability of crew survival? 1 
Solution: Let A = event of crew death, B1 = event of launch vehicle success, 1 
I and B2 = event of launch vehicle failure. Note that B1 and B2 are mutually 
exclusive, and that 
P(B1) = 0.98 P(A/Bl) = 0 (abort system not needed) 
P(B2) = 0.02 P(A/B2) = 0.05 (abort system fails) 
Then from the Law of Conditional Probabilities, 
P(A) = P(Bi)P(A/Bl) + P(B2)P(A/B2) = (0.98)(0) + (0.02)(0.05) = 0.001 
I 
The reliability of crew survival is then 
Rs = 1 - P(A) = 0.999 
i.e., the crew has a 99.9% chance of survival, even though neither the launch 
vehicle nor the abort system is anywhere close to being 99.9% reliable. I 
The example provides considerable insight into the benefits of redundancy, 
i.e., the provision of independent, parallel systems to accomplish a given function 
(in Example 12.1, the required function is ensuring crew survival, not reaching 
orbit). Upon closer examination, it provides equal insight into one of the hazards 
of relying on the predictions of an analytical model, that is, the conclusions are 
only as valid as the assumptions underlying the model. 
In Example 12.1, we explicitly assume that launch vehicle and abort system 
failures are independent events. Such an assumption can be extremely difficult to 
realize in practice and equally difficult, if not impossible, to verify. It is a simple 
matter to postulate launch vehicle failure modes that result in damage to the crew 
module abort system or, for that matter, to note that some types of abort system 
failures could result in destruction of the launch vehicle. The launch and abort 
systems would then not be independent and would then not be, from a crew 
survival viewpoint, fully redundant. In all likelihood, a 99.9% total system 
reliability for crew survival would be extremely difficult to achieve. 
Two of the greatest hazards in reliability analysis are the accurate 
determination of the underlying failure probabilities of components, subsystems 
and systems, and the problem of ensuring that the failure modes of a given item 
and its effects on the remainder of the system are sufficiently well understood that 
the reliability model accurately represents the actual system. Both of these issues 
are addressed in later sections of this chapter.

Example 12.1

A manned space launch system has a generic reliability, or probability of
success, of 0.98. An abort system for the crew module is provided and has a
reliability of 0.95. What is the overall probability of crew survival?

Solution: Let A = event of crew death, B, = event of launch vehicle success,
and By = event of launch vehicle failure. Note that B, and Bz are mutually
exclusive, and that

P(B,) = 0.98 P(A/B,) =0 (abort system not needed)
P(B) = 0.02 P(A/B2) = 0.05 (abort system fails)

Then from the Law of Conditional Probabilities,
P(A) = P(B,)P(A/B,) + P(B2)P(A/Bz) = (0.98)(0) + (0.02)(0.05) = 0.001

The reliability of crew survival is then
Rs = 1 — P(A) = 0.999

i.e., the crew has a 99.9% chance of survival, even though neither the launch
vehicle nor the abort system is anywhere close to being 99.9% reliable.

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS 571 
The production volume of typical space systems greatly limits the accuracy 
with which most reliability analysis can be performed. For example, no launch 
system in existence has flown sufficiently often, in an identical configuration 
from launch to launch, to allow failure probabilities to be as well established as 
just implied. An abort system would typically be subject to much less testing than 
the launcher, and most such tests would, by their nature, be under conditions 
similar but not identical to those encountered after a true launch vehicle failure, 
of which there could in any case be many types. Excellent and subtle methods of 
statistical inference exist t.0 establish reliability information from limited samples 
of data. We will touch on this subject in a later section. However, no statistical 
method can yield really accurate results from the sample sizes typical of space 
flight systems. It is crucially important that the system engineer understand these 
inherent limits on any reliability analysis that is performed. 
This discussion illustrates a simple case in which an a priori failure analysis or 
prediction is required. In other cases, we may know or postulate that a failure 
occurs and wish to know the conditional probability that it is due to particular 
cause B,. To determine this, we note from Eq. (12.2) that 
P(A fl Bj) = P(A)P(Bj/A) = P(Bj)P(A/Bj) (12.5) 
from which we obtain Bayes' Theorem, 
The various P(Bj/A) are called a posteriori probabilities. As before, the events Bi 
must be mutually exclusive. Again, an example, given in Example 12.2, best 
serves to illustrate the potential uses of Bayes's Theorem.

In this case, X would be considered to provide a more accurate measurement than

various moments of the joint density function, i.e., the mean or first moment of X
is given by

p= E(X) = [E(X), E%),..., EX)" (12.24)

positive, and so the integral taken over the range (- 00, oo) will be zero. 
Conversely, if Xi and Xi are correlated, they will to some extent vary in phase, 
their product will tend to be predominantly of one sign or the other, and their 
integrated product will be non-zero. The magnitude of the uu provides a measure 
of this correlation, especially when appropriately normalized. To do this, we 
define the correlation coefficient 
which varies over the range [- 1, + 11, a result that depends on having defined P 
in Eq. (12.25) in terms of the zero-mean random variable (X - p). 
We note in passing that while independent random variables Xi and Xj are I 
clearly uncorrelated (pu = O), the converse is not true; lack of correlation does 
not imply independence. A trivial example is provided by the sine and cosine 
functions, which are completely dependent in the statistical sense (knowledge of 
sin 8 allows immediate calculation of the value of cos e), but whose integrated I 
product over (- 00, 00) is zero, i.e., they are uncorrelated.

12.4 Special Probability Distributions 
There are several special probability distribution (or density) functions that 
assume particular importance in probability and statistics generally, and with 
system reliability analysis and redundancy management in particular. We 
consider some of these special distributions in the sections that follow. 
12.4.1 Gaussian Distribution 
The most important probability distribution in practical applications is the 
Gaussian or normal distribution. The density function for the Gaussian 
distribution is illustrated in Fig. 12.3 and is given by i 
The mean p and standard deviation cr completely characterize the distribution. 
For this reason, the notatioli X = N(p, u) is often used to indicate that the random 
variable X is normally distributed with mean p and variance 2. For convenience, 
the probability distribution function, which is of course the area under the curve 
of Eq. (12.30), is tabulated in common references4 for the standard normal 
random variable Z = N(0, 1). Any Gaussian random variable X can be so 
576 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN

positive, and so the integral taken over the range (— 0, ©) will be zero.
Conversely, if X; and X; are correlated, they will to some extent vary in phase,
their product will tend to be predominantly of one sign or the other, and their
integrated product will be non-zero. The magnitude of the oj; provides a measure
of this correlation, especially when appropriately normalized. To do this, we
define the correlation coefficient

Oij

PP; = ——_

(12.28)

which varies over the range [— 1, +1], a result that depends on having defined P
in Eq. (12.25) in terms of the zero-mean random variable (X — p).

We note in passing that while independent random variables X; and X; are
clearly uncorrelated (p;; = 0), the converse is not true; lack of correlation does
not imply independence. A trivial example is provided by the sine and cosine
functions, which are completely dependent in the statistical sense (knowledge of
sin 0 allows immediate calculation of the value of cos @), but whose integrated
product over (— 00, 00) is zero, i.e., they are uncorrelated.

If X; and X; are independent, then the joint probability density function is

variable X is normally distributed with mean yz and variance o”. For convenience,
the probability distribution function, which is of course the area under the curve

"Applets" for the computation of Gaussian probabilities are also widely available

The importance of the normal distribution arises from a number of sources. 
The sum of independent Gaussian random variables is itself Gaussian. A linear 
system acting upon an input signal that is a Gaussian random variable produces 
as its output another Gaussian distributed signal. The Gaussian distribution is 
representative of an enormous number of real-world processes, a consequence of 
the central limit theorem of statistics. Loosely speaking, the central limit theorem 
demonstrates that, under certain conditions whose details are not important here, 
the sum of a sufficiently large number of individual probability distributions is, in 
the limit, a Gaussian distribution. It is emphasized that this result is true whether 
or not the underlying distributions are themselves Gaussian! Because most 
practical systems are susceptible to a large number of underlying noise or error 
sources that are individually unknown, and unknowable, the central limit theorem 
assures us that in such cases, noise or errors may be characterized as normally 
distributed. Finally, the normal distribution is among the more analytically 
tractable distributions, a factor that should not be underestimated when it is 
necessary to obtain a real conclusion as opposed to a theoretically intriguing but 
computationally useless result.

because the quality of each gyro is independent of all others (i.e., gyros fail from 
random causes after some period of use, rather than due to a systematic design 
flaw), each subsequent selection is an independent event, and so from Eq. (12.3) 
the probability of selecting four good, and no bad, gyros is

Similarly, three good and one bad gyro (event B) may be selected with probability

The probability of initially selecting a single good gyro is pg = 0.9 =1 — q;
because the quality of each gyro is independent of all others (i.e., gyros fail from

flaw), each subsequent selection is an independent event, and so from Eg. (12.3)
the probability of selecting four good, and no bad, gyros is

Similarly, three good and one bad gyro (event B) may be selected with probability
p31 = (0.9)°(0.1)! = 0.0729

Now, because no one cares which gyro fails, there are four possible ways to do
this, and so

p(B) = 4p3,, = 0.2916 = probability of one bad gyro
Similarly,
P(C) = 6p2.2 = (6)(0.9)°(0.1)* = 0.0486 = probability of two bad gyros

Note, as required,

p(A) + p(B) + p(C) + p(D) + p(E) = 1

Next, we note that the event that at most one gyro fails is the event (A U B).
Because A and B are mutually exclusive,

p(A U B) = p(A) + p(B) = 0.9477

e.g., there is about a 95% probability that four gyros (i.e., one spare) will allow
the mission to be completed. If this probability of success is inadequate, then
either more gyros or better gyros (higher pg) are required.

Example 12.3 is both illustrative and complete, but obviously we do not wish to
work through such a laborious analysis in every case, particularly as the number
of individual units in question increases. However, one may proceed by induction
from Example 12.3 to the general case, where

Eqs. (12.32) and (12.33) are applicable in cases where there are a finite number of 
discrete outcomes, with each outcome consisting of one of two (and only two)

defective or not, and in either case can be explicitly enumerated. Situations that 
may be characterized in these terms are referred to as binomial processes. 
12.4.4 Poisson Dfstributfon i 
Often we must deal with situations in which the appearance of an outcome (an 
event) can be noted, but the non-appearance of the event cannot be explicitly 
observed, and may in fact be non-denumerable. A simple example is the receipt 
of a telephone call during a given time interval. All calls can be counted, but non- 
calls cannot be. so recorded. In such cases, the either/or nature of the binomial 
process exists, but the finite set of non-outcomes does not. An enormous number I

of natural processes (e.g., charged particle radiation dosage, "shot" noise in 
I photomultiplier tubes, micrometeoroid strikes on a spacecraft, etc.) fall into such 
a category, to be described next in terms of Poisson statistics, which may be 
derived as the limit of a binomial random process. 
To determine this limit, we assume that there exists a random event that occurs 
at average rate A in a given interval. We further assume that the interval is divided I 
I 
into n subintervals such that each subinterval is small enough to contain at most l 
one event (e.g., the duration of a telephone ring). Each subinterval thus represents 
an individual experimental trial, during which we either record a success, or not. 
Then the probability of the event occurring in a given subinterval (i.e., on a given I 
trial of the experiment) is I 
A successes g=-= = P(event occurring) n trials 
while, of course, the probability of a non-event during this subinterval is (1 - q). 
With these assumptions we have, as required for applicability of the binomial 
theorem, a countable set of discrete outcomes (n intervals in which we either did I i 
or did not experience the event), as well as a probability q of experiencing the 
event during each experiment. To model this, we compute the probability of k i

defective or not, and in either case can be explicitly enumerated. Situations that

12.4.4 Polsson Distribution

Often we must deal with situations in which the appearance of an outcome (an
event) can be noted, but the mon-appearance of the event cannot be explicitly
observed, and may in fact be non-denumerable. A simple example is the receipt
of a telephone call during a given time interval. All calls can be counted, but non-
calls cannot be so recorded. In such cases, the either/or nature of the binomial :
process exists, but the finite set of non-outcomes does not. An enormous number |
of natural processes (e.g., charged particle radiation dosage, “shot” noise in |
photomultiplier tubes, micrometeoroid strikes on a spacecraft, etc.) fallintosuch
a category, to be described next in terms of Poisson statistics, which may be
derived as the limit of a binomial random process.

To determine this limit, we assume that there exists a random event that occurs
at average rate A in a given interval. We further assume that the interval is divided
into n subintervals such that each subinterval is small enough to contain at most
one event (e.g., the duration of a telephone ring). Each subinterval thus represents
an individual experimental trial, during which we either record a success, or not.
Then the probability of the event occurring in a given subinterval (i.e., on a given ;
trial of the experiment) is

A successes .

q= a tals = P(event occurring) (12.34) |

while, of course, the probability of a non-event during this subinterval is (1 — q).
With these assumptions we have, as required for applicability of the binomial
theorem, a countable set of discrete outcomes (7 intervals in which we either did
or did not experience the event), as well as a probability g of experiencing the
event during each experiment. To model this, we compute the probability of k

As we have discussed, space systems, more so than many other engineering

probability density function expressing the probability per unit time of failing. 
Note that this is by definition theJirst failure. From Eq. (12.8) the probability of 
failure during time interval At is thenf(t)At, and the probability of the occurrence 
of failure by time t is given by 
Note that F(t) is a probability distribution function. The reliability of the system 
is then the probability that no failure occurs, i.e., 
Now, for the system to fail between time t and t + At, it must first survive to time 
t. Let S be the event of survival to time t, and F the event of failure in the time 
interval At. Then the conditional probability of failure between time t and t + At, 
given survival to time t, is from Eq. (12.2)

then we obtain the so-called exponential distribution,

and the failure density function in this case is

"old-age" regions of the hazard function. Between these regions normally lies an 
extended period of approximately constant failure rate. Systems operating in this

Solution: The average failure rate per thruster is
_ 1 failure __ 0.0385 failures

There are 16 thrusters in the system, each independent of the others, and so the
system failure rate is

theory. As earlier, T = 1/A is the failure time constant (often called, for obvious 
reasons, the l/e point). The constant to, often taken as 0, is the value prior to 
which no failure is ever observed to occur. It is seen that the hazard function 
depends on the constant P (called the Weibull modulus) for its character; if 
p = 1, we recover the constant-failure-rate law. If p < 1, the hazard rate is seen 
to decrease with time, i.e., the older the system, the less likely it is to fail in a 
given time interval, and conversely for P > 1. Thus, the Weibull distribution can 
be used to represent systems in either the infant-mortality region or the old-age 
region of their service life. 
The Weibull reliability [e.g., the reliability based on Eq. (12.55) rather than on 
Eq. (12.49) for constant-failure-rate systems] with P < 1 is of particular interest 
in spacecraft design. It has been shown by Hecht and ~echt' that such a 
distribution more accurately characterizes the reliability of modem spacecraft 
than does the more pessimistic assumption of Z(t) = A = constant. 
12.5.4 System A vallabillty 
Often when a subsystem or component of a system fails, circumstances are 
such that a repair can be effected and, after some period of time, the system 
returned to service. This may be true even for a space vehicle, where no physical 
repair is possible but redundant systems or procedures may be activated in the 
event of a failure in the primary system. The consideration of systems that may 
be repaired leads to the concepts of system availability and downtime, to be 
discussed next.

reasons, the 1/e point). The constant fo, often taken as 0, is the value prior to
which no failure is ever observed to occur. It is seen that the hazard function
depends on the constant B (called the Weibull modulus) for its character; if
8 = 1, we recover the constant-failure-rate law. If 8 < 1, the hazard rate is seen
to decrease with time, i.e., the older the system, the less likely it is to fail in a
given time interval, and conversely for B > 1. Thus, the Weibull distribution can
be used to represent systems in either the infant-mortality region or the old-age
region of their service life. .

The Weibull reliability [e.g., the reliability based on Eq. (12.55) rather than on
Eq. (12.49) for constant-failure-rate systems] with 8 < 1 is of particular interest
in spacecraft design. It has been shown by Hecht and Hecht* that such a
distribution more accurately characterizes the reliability of modern spacecraft
than does the more pessimistic assumption of Z(t) = A = constant.

12.5.4 System Availability

Often when a subsystem or component of a system fails, circumstances are
such that a repair can be effected and, after some period of time, the system
returned to service. This may be true even for a space vehicle, where no physical
repair is possible but redundant systems or procedures may be activated in the
event of a failure in the primary system. The consideration of systems that may
be repaired leads to the concepts of system availability and downtime, to be
discussed next.

Let us assume that N failures occur over total time 7, and that after any failure
the system is not working, or “down” for some average time 7, while repairs are
made. The total downtime is then

Tz = NT, (12.57)

while the system is available for a total time of
T, = T —Tyg=T — NT, (12.58)

It is more useful to define a fractional downtime D as

Similarly, each mass flow sensor has a downtime of

Dm = DL = 0.0115 
The pressure sensor and mass flow systems are themselves independent (either 
alone can trigger the abort, and so both must fail for the system to fail), hence the 
total failure probability (downtime) of the sensor portion of the abort system is

historical or experimental performance data for the components or systems in

We begin by defining some basic quantities that will be useful. We assume 
there exists a population (e.g., people, launch vehicles, gyroscopes, fuses) that 
consists of N members and is in principle denumerable, whether or not this is 
practical in a given case. The population will have, with respect to its relevant 
characteristics (e.g., height, reliability, MTTF, etc.), certain underlying statistical 
properties, including a probability density function, mean, variance, etc., which 
are a priori unknown and which we seek to determine. If all membeis of the 
population could be sampled and categorized, the task of computing population 
statistics would be trivial, if possibly somewhat laborious. However, this may be

Thus, instead of a fully characterized population, we have available certain

101 1. The sample is of adequate size to assume a Gaussian sampling distri- 
bution for rn, irrespective of the underlying wind pattern. N is implicitly very 
large, and so Eq. (12.69) applies with a = s, hence a, = slJn = 2.5 km/h. For

12.6.4 Small Sample Sets, the t Distribution 
It is not uncommon to encounter sample sizes too small to justify the use of the 
previous results. This can be especially true in aerospace applications, where it 
will be appreciated that the number of spacecraft, missiles, launch vehicles, etc., 
for which a reliability analysis is to be performed is often quite limited. However, 
if the sample set is small (less than 30 samples or so), if the underlying population 
is normally distributed, and if the sample variance s is used as an estimator of 
the population variance 2, then it is found that the interval estimate for p 
satisfies

area a/2 under each tail of the distribution. The t distribution is shown in Fig. 12.6 
for a few representative degrees of freedom. As previously, (1 - a) = P is the 
confidence coefficient or confidence level, and + tn-1,,/2s/Jn is the confidence 
interval. 
The t distribution may be viewed as a more general form of the normal 
distribution and is actually a separate distribution for each value of n, converging 
to the Gaussian for n + 00, but valid for all sample sizes as long as the 
underlying population is Gaussian. (This additional and possibly restrictive 
assumption is unnecessary for large sample sizes, as discussed earlier, allowing 
us to use the simpler normal distribution in such cases.) As with other special 
probability distributions discussed in this text, the t distribution is tabulated in 
standard references4 or available online. Table 12.2 provides a few t values for 
representative confidence levels and degrees of freedom.

12.7 Design Considerations

The preceding text and examples enable the reader to analyze and assess the
reliability of a given system in many simple but nonetheless realistic and
interesting cases. It is hoped that this has also fostered some insight into how
systems must be designed to attain desired levels of reliability. In this section, we
explore these design techniques in more detail.

RELIABILITY ANALYSIS 601 
" Because physical repair is normally not an option, two basic approaches are 
used to achieve a reliable spacecraft design. These are fault avoidance and fault 
tolerance, and they may be used separately or in combination in any given 
system. 
The goal of fault avoidance, as the name implies, is simply to ensure that a 
part, subsystem, or complete system does not fail. This is normally accomplished 
through the provision of ample environmental and performance margins in the 
basic design, the use of carefully selected, screened,'parts, rigorously controlled 
assembly procedures conducted in very clean environments, extensive subsystem 
and system-level testing, and extensive review and documentation of all steps in 
the process. This documentation will include all design drawings and analysis, 
assembly history, test results, and historical information concerning the parts and 
components used in the spacecraft, quite possibly down to the materials from 
which the parts were fabricated. Such documentation allows the most rigorous 
possible understanding of the systemic causes of mistakes, design flaws, 
component failures, and test? anomalies when and as they are discovered. These 
and other procedures are provided in excruciating detail in applicable military 
standards (and therefore the de facto government and industry standard as well) 
governing this ~ubject.~'~ 
With enough care, it is indeed possible to develop almost fault-free systems. 
However, it will be apparent to the reader that "enough care" can be exceedingly 
expensive and time consuming, and equally apparent that complex systems (e.g., 
those with many components) will always be vulnerable to random failure of 
isolated components. As an elementary example, consider a large system with 
one million individual parts, each of which has a failure probability of over 
the duration of a given mission. From our earlier discussion of Poisson statistics, 
it is seen that such a system has a substantial risk of failure, approximately 63%. 
It would in practice be exceedingly difficult to achieve a mission' failure .rate as 
low as for each of a million parts used in a spacecraft. Indeed, while specific 
details vary, it may be stated as a rule of thumb that the reliability of the best 
screened class S parts is only about 10 times that of good commercial parts. If 
achieved, such performance levels are often even more difficult to verify. Thus, 
even with the best materials and procedures, it may be impossible to know 
whether the desired level of reliability has been reached. 
For these reasons, fault avoidance is rarely if ever employed as the sole means 
of attaining a particular level of system reliability. It is of greatest value in simple 
systems, in systems such as launch vehicles whose operating lifetime is relatively 
short, or when no other approach is physically possible. (One cannot, for 
example, have redundant airplane wings.) In other cases, some of the techniques 
of fault avoidance are normally combined with those of fault tolerance, to which 
many of our previous examples have alluded. 
As the name implies, fault tolerance means that the system or subsystem is 
designed to operate after one or more random failures. For example, a common 
design criterion for manned or very expensive unmanned space systems is two-

With enough care, it is indeed possible to develop almost fault-free systems.
However, it will be apparent to the reader that “enough care” can be exceedingly
expensive and time consuming, and equally apparent that complex systems (e.g.,
those with many components) will always be vulnerable to random failure of
isolated components. As an elementary example, consider a large system with
one million individual parts, each of which has a failure probability of 10~° over
the duration of a given mission. From our earlier discussion of Poisson statistics,
it is seen that such a system has a substantial risk of failure, approximately 63%.
It would in practice be exceedingly difficult to achieve a mission failure rate as
low as 10. ° for each of a million parts used in a spacecraft. Indeed, while specific
details vary, it may be stated as a rule of thumb that the reliability of the best
screened class S parts is only about 10 times that of good commercial parts. If

fault tolerance, sometimes referred to as "fail-op, fail-op, fail-safe" design. The 
idea is that the spacecraft should continue to function after any two random 
failures, and should remain at least safely non-operational after a third failure. 
Any fault-tolerant design requires the incorporation of redundancy, i.e., the 
provision of extra components or systems by means of which the desired task can 
be accomplished despite the failure of the first component or system. Usually 
some means of detecting the initial fault and switching the old and new systems is 
also required. Redundancy can be provided within components, among 
-components, across subsystems, and at the whole-system level. As an example, 
at the component level a spacecraft power system might feature a main bus 
consisting of several wires (each oversized) in case one wire or connector pin 
fails. Multiple main buses, each capable of carrying the entire load, might be used 
to guard against a damaged harness. At the subsystem level, redundint power 
supplies could be provided. Additionally, if the mission is very important, 
more than one spacecraft could be launched taimprove the probability of 
success. (Early planetary missions routinely featured the launch of two identical 
spacecraft during a given mission opportunity for just this reason.) 
The incorporation of redundant systems, and the resultant effect on system 
reliability, is easily analyzed with the tools we have developed, subject as always 
to our assumption of the independence of subsystem-level failures. Indeed, many 
of the principles of design redundancy have been illustrated in the examples in 
this chapter. Figure 12.8 depicts the use of redundant blocks to achieve a given 
system function. 
When, for whatever reason, such design redundancy fails, mission controllers 
may on occasion employ functional redundancy to achieve their goals. 
Functional redundancy refers'to the use of physically different systems to 
accomplish the originally planned task. Too often, this occurs according to the 
rule that "necessity is the mother of invention" rather than as a planned strategy. 
A classic example is provided by the Mariner 10 mission to Mercury and Venus, 
wherein the attitude control system failed to provide roll stability because of an 
unanticipated flaw in the original design. Roll stability was provided throughdut 
the mission through the use of differential solar radiation pressure torque (see 
Chapter 7) caused by individually tilting the spacecraft solar arrays.

redundancy occurred during the Apollo 13 lunar mission. When an oxygen tank

that failures of individual subsystems are independent. Nature frequently

effective to employ parallel redundant plumbing lines to convey propellant from 
a tank to a thruster. However, it would normally be considered much more 
practical to carry two command receivers rather than to design a single radio 
receiver with every internal circuit redundantly wired. The choice of redundancy 
partitioning or cross-strapping thus varies from system to system, but can be 
illustrated conceptually as shown in Fig. 12.9. The dual-string system is single-

nonredundant system, because there are more components. Of course, any broken 
component must be repaired before launch or the desired redundancy will not 
exist. Moreover, a first-order analysis of the reliability offered through the use of 
redundant systems will often neglect the failure modes introduced by the 
detection and switching systems. In the final analysis, and in the real world, these 
cannot be ignored. (Is it the oil, or is it the warning light?) Indeed, net system 
safety can be reduced, if one is not careful, by the additional failure modes 
introduced by very complex systems. Furthermore, as we see from the Apollo 13 
example, it sometimes occurs that the catastrophic failure of one redundant 
system component can destroy other perfectly functioning systems. It may well 
be true in particular cases that the theoretical gains from system redundancy are 
offset by the practical difficulties of implementation, and that the resources 
available to the project are best invested in making, and thoroughly testing, a 
simpler and more robust system. The challenge for the system engineer is to 
know when this is so. 
Testing of highly redundant systems is a particular challenge. To have full 
confidence in the system, all logic paths must of course be tested. In Fig. 12.9, the 
dual-string system has only two paths, whereas the cross-strapped system has 
many. In a modem complex system, where redundancy management is often 
implemented in a powerful onboard computer, it may easily result that more logic 
paths exist than could ever be tested in the time available. In such cases the 
spacecraft will be launched with incomplete, and often very incomplete, 
knowledge of all the states into which it could theoreticiilly be commanded. The 
potential for difficulty is obvious. 
None of this is to say that redundancy in a spacecraft is bad. Indeed, it will be 
employed at some level in nearly all spacecraft, certainly those within the present 
authors' experience. However, as with many other tools in the system engineer's 
repertoire, it must be employed with discretion and engineering judgment.

As noted in the introduction to Chapter 12, the material in this appendix is not 
required for a discussion of system reliability at the level presented in this text. 
However, some discussion of random processes is useful in connection with the 
material covered elsewhere in this text, and its treatment logically follows from 
that already presented. We therefore include the required discussion in 
this appendix to avoid intempting the continuity of the material on reliability 
analysis. As always, we omit derivations that can be found in standard texts, 
seeking instead to provide the reader with an understanding of the key ideas and 
results. 
A.2 Concept of a Random Process 
If a random variable Xis a function of time, i.e., X = X(t), then X(t) is said to 
be a random process or stochastic process. Unlike simple random variables, 
random processes are characterized both by their properties at a given time and 
by their behavior as it evolves across time. 
- The value of X(t) at any particular time, for example X(ro) = xo, is a random 
variable characterized by a probability density function f(x, to) and having a

A.1 Introduction

As noted in the introduction to Chapter 12, the material in this appendix is not
required for a discussion of system reliability at the level presented in this text.
However, some discussion of random processes is useful in connection with the
material covered elsewhere in this text, and its treatment logically follows from
that already presented. We therefore include the required discussion in
this appendix to avoid interrupting the continuity of the material on reliability
analysis. As always, we omit derivations that can be found in standard texts,
seeking instead to provide the reader with an understanding of the key ideas and
results.

A.2. Concept of a Random Process

If a random variable X is a function of time, i.e., X = X(z), then X(2) is said to
be a random process or stochastic process. Unlike simple random variables,
random processes are characterized both by their properties at a given time and
by their behavior as it evolves across time.

The value of X(t) at any particular time, for example X(fo) = xo, is a random
variable characterized by a probability density function f(x, f) and having a
mean, variance, etc., just as for any random variable. For example, if the density
function is Gaussian, we have by analogy to Eq. (12.30),

4 _ 2
fod= E mor(o| exp _ | (A.1)

then the process is said to be a Gaussian random process.

A random process governed by a density function that is constant in time is
called a stationary process. (Technically, such a process would be strictly
stationary, to distinguish it from those that are stationary. only through one or
more moments of the distribution.’ This distinction and its implications are well
beyond the scope of this text, as is the discussion of nonstationary processes in
general.) Note that a stationary process does not imply that any given outcome
X(to) must be the same as another outcome X(t,) at a different time. However, the

Time 
Fig. A.1 Ensemble of sample functions of random process {X(t)). density function that determines the range and frequency of values for X(t) is not 
a function of time and can therefore be written asf(x, t) =Ax). The moments of a 
stationary random process, E[X(t)], E[X '(t)], etc., are of course also constant; 
thus, if the Gaussian process of Eq. (A.l) were stationary, y and u would be 
constant. 
A given random function X(t) is considered to be a representative sample, or 
sample function, taken from an ensemble of such functions, denoted by {X(t)} and 
shown graphically in Fig. A.1. A given sample function X(t) may be viewed as 
the result of a particular trial run of an experiment; the ensemble {X(t)} is the 
set of all trials that could occur. As an example, any sample function ii~ the 
ensemble shown in Fig. A.l might represent the attitude history (e.g., pointing I 
angle vs time) of a given spacecraft axis. The entire ensemble might represent 
the set of all possible attitude histories that could be produced by the given I 
spacecraft operating in its environment. 
At any point in time, {X(t)} represents all possible values of x that the random 
process X(t) can produce. This range of values is governed by the density function 
Ax, t). The expected value of the random process X(t) is then calculated by 
averaging across the ensemble {X(t)} in the usual fashion,

density function that determines the range and frequenty of values for X(¢) is not
a function of time and can therefore be written as f(x, t) = f(x). The moments of a
stationary random process, E[X(1)], E[X 2(1)], etc., are of course also constant;
thus, if the Gaussian process of Eq. (A.1) were stationary, 4 and o would be
constant.

A given random function X(f) is considered to be a représentative sample, or
sample function, taken from an ensemble of such functions, denoted by {X(1)} and '
shown graphically in Fig. A.1. A given sample function X(t) may be viewed as
the result of a particular trial run of an experiment; the ensemble {X(t)} is the
set of all trials that could occur. As an example, any sample function in the
ensemble shown in Fig. A.1 might represent the attitude history (e.g., pointing
angle vs time) of a given spacecraft axis. The entire ensemble might represent |
the set of all possible attitude histories that could be produced by the given
spacecraft operating in its environment.

At any point in time, {X(1)} represents all possible values of x that the random
process X(t) can produce. This range of values is governed by the density function
jix, 1). The expected value of the random process X(t) is then calculated by
averaging across the ensemble {X(s)} in the usual fashion,

I and similarly for the higher ogler moments, precisely as we have seen earlier for 
random variables. The mean or expected value of X(t), E[X(t)], is thus seen to be 
the ensemble average across all possible sample functions (X(t)) at time to. 
Because the random process X(t) evolves in time, it is of course also possible 
I to define and compute moments based on time-averaging the data from a given 
sample function, i-e., .

An ergodic random process is one for which, loosely speaking, time averages 
and the ensemble averages are identical. That is, any process statistic (e.g., mean, 
variance, etc.) is the same regardless of whether the calculation is performed 
across the members of the ensemble or by averaging the behavior of one sample 
function from the ensemble over a sufficiently long period of time. Obviously, 
any ergodic process is stationary; however, the converse is not true. 
The ergodic hypothesis, when employed in engineering practice with respect 
to a given random process, is usually unverifiable but is nonetheless crucial to the 
practical application of stochastic theory. The difficulty of verification follows 
from the fact that, as observers, we usually see only one or a few members of the 
total ensemble of sample functions {X(t)}. Theoretical work can always proceed 
under the assumption that a particular probability distribution is of interest, 
whether this is justified in practice or not. However, in a given application, the 
time-averaged statistics of a given sample function are typically all with which 
we have to work. In the preceding attitude control example, the reader will note 
that we can observe only one attitude history, not the entire set that might have 
been possible had different trial runs been performed. Thus, since in engineering 
practice ensemble averages cannot usually be found, time averages of a given 
sample function will be used to obtain estimates of the mean and variance for the 
process (only rarely are higher order moments used). The assumption of 
ergodicity will be applied, and the moments obtained via Eqs. (A.3) and (A.4) 
will be taken as equivalent to ensemble averages. 
A.3 Autocorrelation and Cross-Correlation Functions 
As a random process evolves in time, the sample function X(t) is generated 
and, by analogy with the question of correlation among joint random variables, 
the issue arises as to the relationship, if any, between X(tl) and X(t2). The 
implications of such a relationship will shortly be seen to have a profound 
influence on the response of systems to random inputs. This goes to the heart of 
RANDOM PROCESSES 611

and similarly for the higher order moments, precisely as we have seen earlier for
random variables. The mean or expected value of X(t), E[X(0], is thus seen to be
the ensemble average across all possible sample functions {X(1)} at time fp.

Because the random process X(t) evolves in time, it is of course also possible
to define and compute moments based on time-averaging the data from a given
sample function, i.e.,

T/2
E[X] = (1/T) | X(t) dt (A.3)
Too J—T/2
T/2
E[X?] = (1/T) | X(t) dt (A.4)
T>0 J-T/2

An ergodic random process is one for which, loosely speaking, time averages
and the ensemble averages are identical. That is, any process statistic (e.g., mean,
variance, etc.) is the same regardless of whether the calculation is performed
across the members of the ensemble or by averaging the behavior of one sample
function from the ensemble over a sufficiently long period of time. Obviously,
any ergodic process is stationary; however, the converse is not true.

The ergodic hypothesis, when employed in engineering practice with respect
to a given random process, is usually unverifiable but is nonetheless crucial to the
practical application of stochastic theory. The difficulty of verification follows
from the fact that, as observers, we usually see only one or a few members of the
total ensemble of sample functions {X()}. Theoretical work can always proceed
under the assumption that a particular probability distribution is of interest,
whether this is justified in practice or not. However, in a given application, the
time-averaged statistics of a given sample function are typically all with which
we have to work. In the preceding attitude control example, the reader will note
that we can observe only one attitude history, not the entire set that might have
been possible had different trial runs been performed. Thus, since in engineering
practice ensemble averages cannot usually be found, time averages of a given
sample function will be used to obtain estimates of the mean and variance for the
process (only rarely are higher order moments used). The assumption of
ergodicity will be applied, and the moments obtained via Eqs. (A.3) and (A.4)
will be taken as equivalent to ensemble averages.

A.3 Autocorrelation and Cross-Correlation Functions

As a random process evolves in time, the sample function X(t) is generated
and, by analogy with the question of correlation among joint random variables,
the issue arises as to the relationship, if any, between X(t) and X(t). The
implications of such a relationship will shortly be seen to have a profound
influence on the response of systems to random inputs. This goes to the heart of

61 2 SPACE VEHICLE DESIGN 
several topics discussed earlier in this text, e.g., the response of a spacecraft 
structure to the random vibration generated by its launch vehicle, the boresight 
disturbance of a given sensor in response to jitter from a source elsewhere on the I 
spacecraft, etc. In keeping with the assumptions made elsewhere in this text and 
in this section, we will shortly specialize our discussion to the response of linear 
time-invariant (LTI), single-input single-output (SISO) systems to ergodic (hence 
stationary) random processes. For the moment, we begin with the more general 
case. 
Retreating to first principles, and as noted earlier in connection with random 
variables, there will exist a joint probability distribution function (even if I I

which gives the probability of the joint event that X(tl ) 5 xl and X(t2) 5 x2. The 
joint probability density function f (XI, tl , x2, t2) is defined by Eq. (AS), or 
equivalently as 
Reflecting common engineering practice, the need for analytic tractability, and 
the oft-stated limitations on the scope of this text, we restrict ourselves to the 
second-order statistical treatment just implied by considering values of the 
process at only tl and t2. 
As an example of a particularly useful random process, we offer the bivariate 
Gaussian distribution with x = (xl , x2), 
where p and P are given by Eqs. (12.24) and (12.25).

of the values of the random process X(t) obtained at times tl and t2. 
In what follows we will consider the effect of a linear time-invariant system on 
a random input X(t), thus producing a random output Y(t). A key result of this 
section will be to describe the statistical properties of Y(t) in terms of both the 
system parameters and the properties of X(t). 
We will therefore be interested the cross-correlation function, 
If we invoke the usual assumption that X(t) and Y(t) are zero-mean processes, 
then Rxx and Rxr are covariance functions, exactly as noted earlier in connection 
with joint random variables. Note that RH, RXY, Rm, and Rw are identical to the 
uij of Eq. (12.26), defined earlier in connection with joint random variables. 
At this point we specialize our discussion to the case in which X(t) and Y(t) are 
at least stationary processes. It is then clear that Rxx and Rxy, being results of an 
expectation operation, cannot depend on tl for their computation, but only on the 
digerenee r = t2 - tl . Equations (A.8) and (A.9) then become 
where, again, the choice of absolute time t is irrelevant. 
As before, we note that while the analyst may postulate any desired probability 
density function and so compute Rxx and RXY as ensemble averages, the engineer 
whose goal is to interpret test or telemetry data has no such luxury. He must work 
with the single, or very few, sample functions that can be obtained. As discussed 
earlier, we can integrate over a representative (theoretically infinite) segment of a

oy of Eq. (12.26), defined earlier in connection with joint random variables.

At this point we specialize our discussion to the case in which X(t) and Y(t) are
at least stationary processes. It is then clear that Ryx and Rxy, being results of an

E[x~(~)I = RXY(O) 2 IR;YX(T)I (A. 16) 
The latter property is worth emphasizing; a valid autocorrelation function is 
symmetric about and attains its maximum value at the origin, reflecting that fact 
that the highest possible correlation must occur when X(t) is correlated with itself. 
It is common to normalize the autocorrelation function by the factor 1 /E[X 2(t)], 
thus guaranteeing Rxx(0) = 1. 
Finally, we note before leaving this section that a Gaussian random process 
has the unique analytical advantage that because the distribution is fully

correlation function is sufficient to describe the process completely. 
It remains to provide an interpretation of the autocorrelation function. Recall 
that Rar) is a measure of the degree, on average, to which a given value xl of a 
sample function X(t) at time tl is correlated with another given value x2 from the 
same sample function at a later time, t2 = tl + 7. Thus, if RXX(~) is sharply 
peaked, later values of X(t) are only poorly correlated with earlier values; 
knowledge of X(t) at time tl will be of little help in predicting X(t) at tl + r. In 
that way, the stochastic process X(t) is more 'random', in the colloquial sense, 
than another process with a more broadly peaked autocorrelation function. 
The extreme case of a broadly peaked autocorrelation function would be 
R=(T) = Rm(0) = RO (A. 17) 
i.e., the average correlation between X(t) and X(t + T) is a constant. While X(t) 
and X(t + r) are separate random variables drawn from the same probability 
distribution, on average they are correlated to an extent given by the magnitude of 
Ro. If the process X(t) is viewed as 'noise' that is corrupting an underlying

E[X?(1)] = Rxx(0) = [Rxx(9)I (A.16)

The Jatter property is worth emphasizing; a valid autocorrelation function is
symmetric about and attains its maximum value at the origin, reflecting that fact
that the highest possible correlation must occur when X(t) is correlated with itself.
It is common to normalize the autocorrelation function by the factor 1/E[X 21,
thus guaranteeing Rxx(0) = 1.

Finally, we note before leaving this section that a Gaussian random process
has the unique analytical advantage that because the distribution is fully
characterized if E[X(t)] and E[X7()] are known, knowledge of the auto-
correlation function is sufficient to describe the process completely.

It remains to provide an interpretation of the autocorrelation function. Recall
that Ryx(7) is a measure of the degree, on average, to which a given value x, of a
sample function X(f) at time t, is correlated with another given value x2 from the
same sample function at a later time, t, = t, + 7. Thus, if Ry,(7) is sharply
peaked, later values of X(t) are only poorly correlated with earlier values;
knowledge of X(t) at time ¢; will be of little help in predicting X(t) at t; + 7. In
that way, the stochastic process X(t) is more ‘random’, in the colloquial sense,
than another process with a more broadly peaked autocorrelation function.

The extreme case of a broadly peaked autocorrelation function would be

i.e., the average correlation between X(t) and X(t + 7) is a constant. While X(2)
and X(t + 7) are separate random variables drawn from the same probability
distribution, on average they are correlated to an extent given by the magnitude of
Ro. If the process X(t) is viewed as ‘noise’ that is corrupting an underlying
‘signal’ of interest, then X(t) may be visualized as a random bias.”

At the opposite extreme would be the case in which Rxx(7) is given by the

Clearly, when Ryy(7) = Rod(7), the process X(t) has, on average, no
correlation at all with X(¢ +- 7) for any non-zero value of 7; knowledge of X(f) is

the well-known and often-utilized white noise process, to be discussed further in
the following section.

A.4 Linear System Response to Random Processes

Our primary interest in the subject of random processes lies in the response of
spacecraft systems to random inputs; such inputs are usually considered to be
noise, and thus as disturbances to the intended operation of the system. It is
therefore desired to characterize the statistical properties of the output, given the
input and the system parameters. We consider the elementary case of a linear,
single-input, single-output system, for which the response at time ¢ to an input

x(7) is

t
y(t) = | A(t, 1)x(7) dt (A.20)
09

The function A(t, 7) is the impulse response of the system, i.e., the response at
time f to the unit impulse (7) applied at time 7. For our purposes, it might be the
response of one part of a spacecraft structure given an excitation at another
point, or it might be an attitude control command issued in response to a unit
disturbance. Because linear systems have the property of superposition (the total
output of a sum of input signals is the sum of the individual outputs), we can omit
any discussion of the desired signal and consider only the behavior of the system
in response to the additive noise taken here as the random process x(t).

We note that causal systems require h(t, 7) = 0 for t < 7; there can be no
system response prior to the input. Also, if the system is time invariant, the origin
in time is irrelevant, and h(t, 7) = h(t — 7). Then we can write

t
y(t) = | h(t — r)x(1) dt = [. hA(px(t — 7) dr (A.21)
—co 0

The simplification to a LTI SISO system allows us to convert the preceding
convolution integral to an algebraic expression, i.e.,

Y(w) = H(@)X(w) (A.22)

where H(w), X(w), and ¥(w) are the Fourier transforms of h(t), x(), and y(t), with
w = 2nf being the natural frequency. Thus,

If the input function x(t) is a deterministic waveform, such as a step, ramp, or

y(t), and especially the mean and variance. These provide an indication of the 
behavior to be expected on average and the deviations that can be expected about

The relationship between the mean values of the input and output is easily 
obtained by taking the expected value of Eq. (A.21). Since h(r) is a deterministic 
function and E[x(t)] is a constant for an ergodic process, we can exchange the

have been used to obtain Sdw) and SXy(o), Ryy(7) and RXY(r) can be obtained 
using the inverse Fourier transform, Eq. (A.24). From Eq. (A.16), we note that

which is the result we have sought. 
The terms SAW) and Sdw) are known as the power spectral density of the 
random processes x(t) and y(t), respectively, while SAW) is the cross-power 
spectral density of x(t) and y(t). These terms arise from the general usage of 
"power" to indicate a squ'ared signal amplitude, while the magnitude of Sm, Sxr, 
and Sn at a specific value of o gives the power density at that frequency. Indeed, 
integration of SAW) from (- w, 00) gives the total power in the signal, while 
integration between [wl, w] gives the power in that frequency band. The utility 
of this approach is obvious, to the point where it is probably more common to 
characterize joint random processes in terms of their power spectral density, or 
cross-power spectral density, than otherwise. 
When we speak of "white noise," here and in Chapters 7 and 11, the reference 
is to a process with a constant noise power spectral density across all frequencies, 
i.e., S(o) = 27rS0 3 Ro. We had earlier referred to the special autocorrelation 
function, RAT) = RO $7), as the white noise process. Recalling that the Fourier 
transform of $7) is a constant, i.e., 
establishes the connection between the time- and frequency-domain represen- 
tations of the white noise process. 
As noted earlier, white noise is an idealization; such a signal would have 
infinite total power and thus cannot actually exist. However, the idealization is 
quite useful when confined to a specific frequency band; also, many "colored" 
noise processes can be derived theoretically by passing white noise through a 
shaping filter defined by H(o), exactly as in Eq. (A.28). The use of white 
Gaussian noise (WGN) is without doubt the single most common assumption in 
the application of stochastic process theory to real system3

where Sxx(w), Sxy(w), and Syy{w) are the Fourier transforms of Ryx(7), Rxy(7)
and Ry;(1), respectively, defined via Eq. (A.23). Once Eqs. (A.28)-and (A.29)
have been used to obtain Sy{w) and Sx)(w), Ry(7) and Ry (7) can be obtained
using the inverse Fourier transform, Eq. (A.24). From Eq. (A.16), we note that
Ely 2(t)] = Ryx(0) then gives the variance of the output random process y(#),
which is the result we have sought.

The terms Syx(w) and Sy{w) are known as the power spectral density of the
random processes x(t) and y(t), respectively, while Syy(w) is the cross-power
spectral density of x(t) and y(t). These terms arise from the general usage of
“power” to indicate a squared signal amplitude, while the magnitude of Sxx, Sxy,
and Syy at a specific value of w gives the power density at that frequency. Indeed,
integration of Sxx(w) from (— %, 0) gives the total power in the signal, while
integration between [@, #2] gives the power in that frequency band. The utility
of this approach is obvious, to the point where it is probably more common to
characterize joint random processes in terms of their power spectral density, or
cross-power spectral density, than otherwise.

When we speak of “white noise,” here and in Chapters 7 and 11, the reference
is to a process with a constant noise power spectral density across all frequencies,
ie., S(@) = 27S = Ro. We had earlier referred to the special autocorrelation
function, Rxx(7) = Ro 47), as the white noise process. Recalling that the Fourier
transform of 6(7) is a constant, i.e.,

S(w) = [ Ro Xe!” dr = Roe = Ro = 2718p (A.30)

establishes the connection between the time- and frequency-domain represen-
tations of the white noise process.

As noted earlier, white noise is an idealization; such a signal would have
infinite total power and thus cannot actually exist. However, the idealization is
quite useful when confined to a specific frequency band; also, many “colored”
noise processes can be derived theoretically by passing white noise through a
