A ground system (1) supports the space segment (spacecraft and their payloads),
and (2) relays to users mission data generated by onboard instruments and received
from the spacecraft. Table 15-1 summarizes these “functions” and corresponding
options.

To support spacecraft and their payloads, the ground system must command and
control them, monitor their health, track them to determine orbital position, and deter-
mine spacecraft attitude from sensor information. The ground system controls the
spacecraft and its instruments or payloads by transmitting command data to the space-
craft. Except for passive echo tracking techniques such as radar or laser reflector, the
ground system uses spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and mission data to carry out
these functions. For example, the ground system may use instrument data from a
spaceborne radar altimeter to refine knowledge of the spacecraft’s orbit.

Ground stations acquire mission data from a spacecraft and its instruments and
transfer it to the data users. The ground system also supplies any telemetry and track-
ing information the data users may need. Most space missions allow the user’s
evolving requirements to influence changes in the ground system’s data relay and
control functions.

Ground systems consist of ground stations and control centers working together to
support the spacecraft and the data user. Figure 15-1 shows how these segments
interact. Generally, the ground system commands and controls the spacecraft based on

requests from the data user to the control centers. Except for communications
satellites,* users do not send commands independently to the spacecraft, because its
overall health depends heavily on the state of individual instruments and systems.

The ground system tries to provide highly available, high-fidelity access to the
spacecraft while remaining transparent to both data users and ground controllers. In
practice though, we must trade off transparency and cost. For example, we may accept
some distortion or loss of mission data, as well as time delays between the spacecraft
and the data users. These delays may range from subseconds to seconds for real-time
data transfer, and from days to weeks for recorded data. In supporting the spacecraft
and payload, we may need to balance length and number of opportunities to command
or monitor the spacecraft with the risk inherent in being out of communication.

Because more complex ground systems are less transparent, we must design them
as simply as possible, consistent with mission requirements. When designing a space
mission, we should trade off space segment and ground system complexity through
several iterations, until we produce best performance at lowest cost (see Chaps. 3
and 4).

15.1 The Ground System Design Process

Table 15-2 summarizes the ground system design process and references discus-
sions pertaining to each step. This process is iterative because the steps interrelate and
we must strike a balance in complexity between the spacecraft and the ground system.
Each iteration must address:

¢ Ground station locations, based on spacecraft coverage and data user needs,
balanced against cost, accessibility, and available communications. You will
need new sites for a dedicated ground system, and suitable existing stations
when using established ground systems.

¢ Link data rates, which establish the required gain-to-noise temperature ratios
(G/Ts), and effective isotropic radiated powers (EIRPs). For dedicated ground
stations, defer details of antenna and RF systems until you have established

* With communications satellites, “mission” data is really communications data being relayed
between two or more “data users.” Here, we simply expand the ground system’s data-transfer
function to include the path from the ground system to the satellite.

624 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.2

these two parameters. For an existing system, determine whether RF links are
adequate and adjust data rates if necessary.

¢ Requirements for data handling, so you can determine where it will occur.
Once you know the location, you can meet almost any need with available
hardware and software, and at reasonable cost. A decision to perform data
handling at a central facility instead of the ground station influences the loca-
tion of the control centers.

¢ Appropriate communications between ground system elements and data users,
for a dedicated system. When using an existing ground system, where most
decisions are already made, confirm that data handling and bandwidth are
adequate.

15.2 A Ground System’s Basic Elements

Figure 15-2 shows that the ground system consists of mission elements and facility
elements. Mission elements control the space segment or handle mission data. Facility
elements support or are otherwise ancillary to mission elements. Both contain mixes
of various hardware, firmware, and software. (In this chapter, I will use the most com-
mon names and acronyms.) The ground system staff uses and coordinates the
operation of the physical components. Mission operations, discussed in Chap. 14,
coordinates activities for the ground system and command and control of the
spacecraft.

The ground station is the Earth-based point of communication with the space
segment for control and, typically, user data. Figure 15-3 shows the basic ground
station, which consists of the following components.

The single antenna system includes the antenna and mount, its associated electro-
mechanical actuators, the consoles and servo circuitry which control the antenna, and
the feeds and transmission lines which carry RF signals to and from the RF equipment.
The antenna, along with the receive RF equipment, satisfies the required receive G/T
at the frequency of the downlink carrier. It also works with the transmit RF equipment
to provide the required EIRP at the uplink carrier frequency. Chapter 13 discusses
these communications links. Antenna steering must provide the look angles required

by the mission. For low-Earth orbit, these can cover essentially all of the visible
hemisphere. It must also provide the required steering modes, such as programmed
computer steering and autotracking. Autotracking refers to the use of the received
spacecraft signal itself to steer the antenna. In this case, the antenna system usually
provides continuous pointing coordinates to the tracking component at the ground
station.

The receive RF equipment is generally in suites of racks, located to minimize
transmission-line losses to the antenna. This equipment accepts the downlink carrier
frequency from the antenna system, downconverts it to intermediate frequencies, and
demodulates it to baseband signals for the equipment devoted to mission data recovery
and TT&C.

Also in racks near the antenna system, the transmit RF equipment accepts tracking
and command signals from the ground system’s TT'&C component and modulates
them onto the RF uplink, which it also generates. In the case of communications
satellites, it also modulates user data onto an uplink carrier.

After the RF receive equipment demodulates the signals, the mission data recovery
equipment conditions the mission data before relaying it to data users and ground

626 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.2

system components. It typically has its own location in the system, but it may be
intermingled with the receive RF suite for simple data streams.

The data user interface connects the mission data recovery equipment and the data
user. If all parts of the ground system and the data user are colocated, this interface
generally consists of no more than manual or electronic patching of the data lines
between the ground station and the user facilities.

The Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) equipment conditions and
distributes received telemetry and tracking signals. It also electrically formats, authen-
ticates, and times transmitted command and tracking signals. It usually processes these
tracking signals and data on the antenna-pointing angle to inform users about range,
range rate, and spacecraft position. TT&C functions are usually highly automated
because of the need for speed, timeliness, and accuracy.

The station control center controls the configuration of, and the interconnects
between, the ground station components. Operating under instructions from the
ground system’s mission control center, it keeps the ground station configured to
support mission operations.

Ground system operations require time coordination, so one system element
maintains a clock precise enough to meet mission requirements; it distributes clock
time and reference frequencies to the other system elements (see Fig. 15-4), moving
through the colocated elements of a ground system by wire or cable. It is accurate to
within milliseconds or better. Its usual one-per-second timing pulses are synchronized
to within a few microseconds or less to a world time scale, such as Universal Time
Coordinated (UTC). Satellites able to transfer time even more precisely, such as GPS,
permit us to synchronize well below a microsecond.

Three types of control centers are generally found within ground systems. The
Spacecraft Operations Control Center (SOCC) monitors and commands the
spacecraft bus and common systems, as opposed to onboard instruments or payloads,
which are controlled by the POCC, as discussed below. The SOCC analyzes spacecraft
telemetry and, when necessary, telemetry and mission data from instruments which
can affect the spacecraft’s attitude and dynamics. As the only ground system element
that directly commands the spacecraft, it coordinates and controls POCC access.
Specifically, it approves the POCC’s requests to command instruments after consider-

15.2 A Ground System’s Basic Elements 627

ing mission plans and schedules, spacecraft health, and the collective well being of the
other instruments on board.

For simple spacecraft, the SOCC also serves as the POCC. On the other hand, we
may need several SOCCs if the space segment is complex. An example might be one
with several complicated spacecraft requiring intensive and near-continuous monitor-
ing and control, such as ground systems which provide user services to other missions
(see Sec. 15.4). We may also need more than one SOCC for backup or for security,
survivability, or other political reasons.

Equipment and people make up the SOCC. The hardware includes data monitoring
equipment and consoles, commanding facilities, and associated communications. This
equipment is usually computer automated for quick response, but humans may inter-
vene at any time to control the spacecraft.

The Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) analyzes telemetry and mission
data from onboard payload instruments and issues commands to these instruments. Its
commands depend on approval by the mission control center, with coordination from
the SOCC. Interactive computer equipment also runs the POCC, with people standing
by during communication with the spacecraft.

We may use multiple POCCs when several onboard instruments require careful
independent supervision or when we need a backup for redundancy or survivability.
We may also need or want to place the POCCs for some instruments near the manu-
facturer or the data user.

The Mission Control Center (MCC) plans and operates the entire space mission,
including the configuration and scheduling of resources for both space and ground
system. It computes and issues information needed by ground system elements and
data users, such as data on the spacecraft’s orbit, ground station pass times, and an-
tenna pointing angles. In simpler systems, we may merge the MCC with the SOCC.

MCCs are best placed near the POCCs and SOCCs, but mission requirements or
other considerations often call for placement elsewhere, thus greatly complicating the
ground system. Location of the MCC depends on security, survivability, and political
or administrative considerations. Sometimes, redundancy demands several MCCs
—one as prime and the others as backups. If ground systems provide services to user
missions, each user mission will have a dedicated MCC. These MCCs are frequently,
but not necessarily, colocated. The host mission MCC may also, but again not neces-
sarily, be near the user MCCs.

The software used for MCC and POCC activities is covered in more detail in
Chap. 14. It is worth noting here, however, that there has in recent years become
available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for integration testing as well as
mission and payload operations, analysis, and planning, and ground system operation,
The best of these packages are very powerful, yet tailorable to a specific spacecraft,
alleviating the need for a program to develop expensive mission-unique software.
Most of these offerings are very efficient and versatile, permitting large reductions in
the required operations team.

Plant facilities include buildings and grounds, utilities, services for the staff, and
security. We normally would use commercial utilities with locally generated backup
for emergencies. For security and survivability, utilities may be wholly self-contained.
Because plants are expensive, we must decide whether to build unique, dedicated
systems or to use existing alternative systems (see Sec. 15.4).

Availability is the percentage of time a ground system is available to support a
mission. The availability we want in a system determines whether maintenance should

628 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.2

use spare or repair. To achieve high availability often requires hot spares (powered on
and ready for operation at a moment’s notice).

Figure 15-5 shows the physical layout of a simple ground system with its data users
colocated, eliminating the need for long-distance communications links between
them. Such a system can provide low-coverage support of up to several spacecraft in
low-Earth orbit on a timeshared basis, or virtually 100% coverage for a single space-
craft in geostationary orbit. One of its advantages is that it can be dedicated to a
particular mission, thereby eliminating schedule conflicts. Also, it is compact and self
contained, allowing all communications between elements to be local and dedicated
thus simplifying the system’s operation and administration.

significant staff services can greatly increase the area for remote installations. See
text for discussion.

Utilities

Unfortunately, this simple ground system also has significant disadvantages. For
example, the single ground station provides very low coverage for low-Earth orbit
spacecraft because a pass (the time period that the spacecraft is in view of a ground
station) lasts only a few minutes, and for other than near-equatorial orbits, does not
occur often. As Sec. 15.5 points out, these conditions prevail because the maximum
viewing angle of a low-Earth orbit spacecraft from any point on the Earth is 20% or
less of the orbital path, and for inclinations above 25 or 30 deg, only 25 to 30% of the
orbits are visible. An exception is polar orbits as seen from polar ground stations,
where each orbit is visible. (See Chap. 5 for visibility formulas.) Another limit is the
system’s inability to support more than one spacecraft link at a time because of the
single antenna and ground station. Also, the simple system can serve only on-site
users. The system’s most important disadvantage, however, is its lack of redundancy.
If any element were to fail we would lose data, or possibly even a spacecraft. Thus,
redundant equipment, spares, and maintenance, as well as geographical location, are
particularly important. To be secure, a completely colocated ground system should be
on domestic soil. Even so, it will not be very survivable, and it will take a long time to

15.3 The Typical Ground System 629

recover from any major damage. For this reason, the military would generally not want
a simple or basic system.

15.2.1 GEOSAT—A “Simple” System

Though not as “simple” as the basic system described above, the GEOSAT’s
ground system shown in Fig. 15-6 is a good practical example. It supports only one
spacecraft with one ground station and colocated components. Launched in the spring
of 1985, this remote, ocean-sensing spacecraft is supported through an S-band telem-
etry and data downlink, a VHF command uplink, and VHF Doppler beacons for
tracking. The ground system provides full telemetry, data, and command support of
the spacecraft. It is located under one roof at the Johns Hopkins University’s Applied
Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, except for the Doppler tracking equipment in
the worldwide system of TRANET Doppler tracking stations.

Figure 15-6 is a functional diagram of the ground system showing in solid lines its
three major segments: the satellite test facility, the digital element, and the computer
system. The figure and nomenclature reflect diagrams typically seen in descriptions
of the GEOSAT ground system. The overlaid dotted boxes show how the functions
fit into the basic components of a ground system with some functions overlapping.
For example, the real-time frame sync and decommutator is involved in operations
for both mission data recovery and TT&C, and the computer system supports many of
the basic components. Further, as is often the case with simpler ground systems, the
SOCC, POCC, and MCC are in one unit. Note that we have not yet discussed some of
the functions, especially for mission data recovery equipment and the data user
interface, which demand more than our simple ground system can provide.

15.3 The Typical Ground System

To support a realistic space mission, a ground system must usually provide high
coverage simultaneously for several spacecraft in various orbits, with high levels of
availability, security, and, for military missions, survivability. Such a system will
usually include many elements in several configurations. The realistic system in
Fig. 15-7 includes standard stations and less capable auxiliary stations, which may be
on aircraft, ships, or land. These auxiliary stations fill gaps in coverage, using equip-
ment similar to that of regular stations and providing radar tracking, telemetry, data
reception, and backup command.

In a real ground system, we may also employ multiple control centers in separate
locations. Thus, as shown, some POCCs are near the SOCC, whereas some are remote.
In this generic system, we designate a SOCC as prime, colocate it with a prime MCC,
and back up both prime centers with remote centers. Multiple control centers are
redundant, survivable, and flexible, allowing responsibility for prime control to pass
back and forth between the centers during various phases of the mission. For example,
we may make the remote SOCC prime during launch and early checkout of the space
segment because it is near the launch or simulation equipment.

Geographical dispersion and multiplicity of elements greatly complicate a ground
system’s design. For example, each location must usually have its own synchronized
timing system, similar to that for the colocated ground system described earlier.
Further, the distributed system requires several physical plants with different admin-

istrative structures, complicated maintenance and logistics networks, and reliable
communications links—all difficult and expensive to implement for remote locations.
Thus that remote tracking station in East Africa, for example, needed to fill a small but
important gap in ground station coverage, may be disproportionately expensive.

15.3.1 Communications Links

Ground systems need long-distance communications links of sufficient bandwidth
between their distributed elements and between them and the data users. These links
mix landline (electrical, terrestrial microwave, and optical) and satellite connections.
Unless the links are part of the ground system itself, they are usually subscribed to or
leased.

We evaluate communications options while determining where to locate the ground
system’s components. For example, we may want to place the SOCC or the MCC near
a metropolitan area to take advantage of its telephone system, but we would want to
place ground stations in less populated areas to lessen radio-frequency interference.
Yet installing new and dedicated communication facilities in a remote area may be
quite costly.

As international, commercial domestic, and military satellite communications have
become more available, we now prefer satellites to provide communications between
remote ground system elements and data users. Because of their high capacity and
performance, communications satellites (comsats) link nearly all intercontinental
elements of ground systems as well as those lying far apart within continents. World-

632 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.3

wide systems may require more than one “hop,” and more than one comsat. For
example, a ground station located in India might communicate with a SOCC in the
United States by accessing an international satellite through a domestic communica-
tions satellite (domsat). Table 15-3 shows several geostationary communications
satellites typically used by ground systems with elements around the world. In general,
portions or all of the available transponder bandwidth may be leased. Martin [1984]
has summarized the technical details of these satellites, and user information is avail-
able from the operating agency. A good basic reference on satellite communications
is Pratt and Bostian [1986].

Even when using comsats, we may need landlines to connect to the ground termi-
nals which access the comsats. With many domsats and military communications
systems, we may be able to use locally placed comsat terminals with user antennas that
access the communication satellite directly. For international satellites, we must
usually link in to a central ground terminal which accesses the satellite. This link is
usually some form of landline, normally a leased telephone line with a high data rate.

To access these communications links, each element requires terminal equipment,
whose complexity depends on the type of link. (Satellite links generally are most com-
plex.) Domestic satellite links usually include options to build, lease, or buy the
terminal equipment. Military communications systems provide qualified users links
through small local terminals and centralized communications stations. Unfortunately,
the small terminals often support relatively narrow bandwidths not suitable to relaying
high speed data.

Thanks to the recent explosion in the ubiquity and versatility of communications
products for networking, an increasing trend in moving data around a ground system
is to use the Internet Protocol (IP) family of protocols. Physical connections can range
from common low rate dialup lines to high speed dedicated channels. For low rate
data, it is feasible to move data between system elements using real-time IP protocols.
High rate data is generally stored initially at a ground station, and forwarded postpass
by protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol). With IP connections, the transport
protocol may be either TCP or UDP.* Where dialup or dedicated lines are used, so that
the potential for data loss is low, the ground system may use UDP, for the increased
data efficiency it provides.

15.3.2 Optional Functions

Each element of the typical system may include functions beyond those in the basic
elements. A good example is the ground station, which can be far more complex than
the basic station we examined earlier. These stations may need several antennas to
support more than one RF link or spacecraft at a time. The antennas may have multiple
feeds to permit simultaneous links at different RF frequencies, or polarization di-
versity to permit simultaneous multiple links at the same frequency. Multiple RF links
in turn require more RF and data recovery equipment, with enhanced performance
needed to allow higher data rates and more sophisticated modulation techniques. Im-
proved TT&C equipment permits increased rates for telemetry and command, more
precise tracking, and coverage for several spacecraft at one time. We may also add to
the ground station new functions such as simulation and verification systems.

* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides a degree of assured data delivery, and adds
overhead to the data transfer. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) uses less overhead but provides
no assurance of delivery of any packet of data.

Data users’ demands usually make ground systems more complex. The user
interface must have versatile switching and interconnection options and connect to
long-distance communications links. We may need to add data-handling equipment to
distribute received data to different users. Data handling includes all processing of
mission data between the ground station’s data recovery equipment and the data user’s
communications interface. Sklar [1988] has rigorously defined various data handling
operations, but I will summarize the most common functions in the following
paragraphs.

634 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.3

Demultiplexing refers to the disassembly of composite data streams received from
spacecraft into selected component data streams for routing to different users. With
multiple POCCs, and possibly with multiple SOCCs, telemetry data also may require
demultiplexing.

Classified or otherwise secure data from spacecraft is often encrypted on board
before transmitting it to the ground where it is decrypted. The data then either flows to
its users directly, without decryption, or it is decrypted before distribution preparatory
to demultiplexing or other data-handling operations. Of course, some data may be re-
encrypted before transmission to some users. To prevent unauthorized commanding
by others, command data is often encrypted as well.

We may apply encoding, a technique which decreases errors in digital data because
of noise, to data streams from spacecraft. We may decode this received data in the
ground system and possibly reencode it before distribution. Command data is fre-
quently encoded to ensure the spacecraft receives error-free commands.

' Data compression refers to the increase in the information capacity of a data stream
to permit delivering its information through a narrower band communications channel
than would otherwise be possible. Alternatively, a compressed data stream can trans-
mit more information over a given bandwidth medium. This technique permits us to
combine one or more data streams into a composite data stream (that is, multiplexing,
the reverse of the demultiplexing described earlier), and distribute it over a com-
munications link which could not handle uncompressed data. We can also use
data compression for a ground system with limited storage and to distribute received
data more quickly.

Timetagging means adding timing information to data streams. If data is not time-
tagged at the spacecraft, either the ground station or the data-handling equipment may
apply time information to it before recording it or distributing it to users. Usually, we
would add an epoch time reference to the data stream in one of several ways. We could
reference it to the station timing system, by giving the time at which data was received
at the ground station, with at least first-order corrections for known equipment delays.
With more sophisticated systems, we could continuously correct the epoch with orbital
information to estimate the actual time the spacecraft generated the data. To interpo-
late the timing of data between epochs, we can use the data clock itself as a time scale
(for synchronous data only).

Instead of routing received data to users immediately, we may wish to record all or
some of it, referred to as data storage, and transmit it later. Also, we may avoid wide-
band communications links by first recording higher rate data and then transmitting it
to users at lower playback rates. In all cases, storage protects against loss of data
during distribution. Magnetic tape has been the storage medium of choice, but optical
storage may eventually supersede it for very large amounts of data.

Data quality monitoring means examining the quality of the space-to-ground data
link by checking predictable groups of bits or waveforms in the received spacecraft
data stream. For example, with synchronous digital data, we can use frame-synchroni-
zation words to count the bit error rate and make sure the link is working properly. In
this way, we can monitor all parts of the ground system used to relay mission data.

These data-handling operations may take place anywhere in the ground system. For
small systems with only one or two ground stations, we would typically handle the
data within the ground station, and transmit it directly to the user. In doing so, we can
reduce bandwidths in communications links to users by separating high-rate compos-
ite data streams into their components and compressing the data at the ground station.

15.3 The Typical Ground System 635

We can also control data security, preserve signal-to-noise quality in the data stream,
and suppress accumulated distortions by processing data as quickly as possible after
receiving and demodulating it. The ground station usually stores and timetags data as
well because mission data has the smallest delay uncertainties there.

Although the ground station usually does the data-handling tasks best, a system
with several ground stations would need links between each of the ground stations and
each of the users to transfer the data—an impractical if not impossible arrangement.
Thus, ground stations often transfer data directly to a central facility (the SOCC for
example), handling only selected operations, such as recording, themselves. The
central facility passes the data on to the users. This procedure minimizes ground
station hardware, centralizes control, and gives more flexible service to data users. It
usually requires dedicated communications links between the ground stations and the
central facility, which can support higher data rates than might otherwise be necessary.

Simulation/Verification (Sim/Ver) systems test the ground system’s readiness using
realistic simulated signals and data. Tests may be at routine intervals, during prepass
or postpass, or following system maintenance or upgrade. Sim/Ver also provides diag-
nostics for troubleshooting and calibrates equipment. When fully implemented, a
Sim/Ver system not only can test individual ground system elements and components,
but also can perform highly automated end-to-end tests of the entire ground system.
But this type of Sim/Ver system is expensive, employed only within elements whose
availability is critical.

15.3.3 Influence of Spacecraft Autonomy

Spacecraft autonomy could potentially simplify the tasks of the SOCC, POCC, and
TT&C elements of the ground system. But unpredictable spacecraft upsets and
malfunctions, including those in the autonomous systems themselves, will force us to
use ground elements at the same level for some time. For example, onboard clocks
may timetag data as it is generated, but the ground system’s ability to timetag received
data will probably be retained as a backup for the foreseeable future.

15.3.4 The DMSP Example System

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is an example of a typical
distributed ground system. Using remote-sensing satellites in low-Earth orbit, it pro-
vides the Department of Defense important environmental information. Figure 15-8
shows its main elements. The spacecraft links are at L-band (1,750 to 1,850 MHz) for
the uplink and S-band (2,200 to 2,300 MHz) for the downlink. Data rates for these
links are 2 kbps (command) and 1,024 kbps (mission data), respectively. The DMSP
ground stations are referred to as Command Readout Stations (CRS). They are supple-
mented by the Automated Remote Tracking Stations of the Air Force Satellite Control
Network’s (AFSCN) ground system.

Mission data is transferred from ground stations to DMSP central facilities by
domestic satellite and landlines. The data is then relayed by similar communications
links to the large data processing users, the Navy oceanographic, and Air Force
weather forecasting centers. This system also is an example of a mission in which
some data users receive mission data directly from the spacecraft. Shipboard and trans-
portable landbased terminals throughout the world receive data on local environmental
conditions directly for immediate use.

We might also note that with the current trend for commercial satellites which
provide imaging and other forms of remote sensing, advances in receiver technology

Stations to control centers and central facilities and for relay of data to large military
data processing centers. Shipboard and mobile terminals receive data directly from

and commercial processing software are now permitting private users to receive such
data directly from these satellites at reasonable cost.

15.4 Alternatives To Building a Dedicated System

Instead of building a dedicated system, we can use existing ground support
networks to supply part or all of the elements needed. A number of commercial and
military ground systems can handle more than one mission and are available to support
user missions. In this service-provided arrangement, the host ground system provides
most of the elements of the user’s ground system. But these existing configurations
cannot satisfy all possible missions, so host systems are usually tailored to particular
kinds. Where necessary, a user mission may have to provide some special equipment,
but they can reduce the amount by designing missions to match the host’s configura-
tion wherever possible. In fact, users must usually meet severe constraints to make
their missions compatible with the host system and other user missions.

Normally, full-service host systems provide all necessary elements of the ground
system, which all users share. Major communication links connect ground stations to
a central facility which houses the user mission’s POCCs, SOCCs and MCC. Either
the host or the user mission may supply the equipment and personnel for these centers.
The central facility probably also contains the host’s SOCC and perhaps, the prime or
backup MCC.

15.4 Alternatives To Building a Dedicated System 637

Use of service-provided ground systems may follow a hybrid arrangement,
combining some dedicated elements from the user mission with others from one or
more host systems. Actually, most service-provided systems require some ground
system construction and some significant elements, or parts of elements, from the user
mission.

These alternative systems have some important advantages over dedicated ones.
For example, they usually save a lot of money and have a defined and predictable cost
schedule. Another advantage is high, predictable reliability and availability. Although
not necessarily designed for it, most are highly survivable because they have many
dispersed assets on the ground, making them important for military missions.

Alternative systems also have disadvantages. For example, matching the user
mission with the system may make the overall mission less effective. Sharing host
resources with other supported missions also demands coordination of activities and
priorities, based on such things as the supported mission’s relative importance, criti-
cality of particular events, and the amount of control the host has over the ground
assets. Contractual negotiations usually determine these priority agreements.

To evaluate potential alternatives to dedicated systems, we must begin by defining
the requirements for key mission parameters and then matching them against the
candidate host systems. As with a dedicated system, we would try to adapt the require-
ments to the host whenever possible through studies and discussions between planners
of mission and host systems. To be efficient, we should evaluate all potential host sys-
tems at the same time. Further, if possible, we should examine service-provided
systems while developing the preliminary design of a dedicated system, if we are
considering one. The final configuration of our ground system would therefore be
based on the best possible information.

In evaluating service-provided ground systems, we must determine how much
users must tailor their missions, how much equipment users must provide, and how
much access users have to ground stations or central distribution points. We would
also need to consider the loading, lifetime, and upgrades planned for host systems.
Another important comparison is between the well defined leasing costs of the host
system, and the cost of building and maintaining a dedicated system, both evaluated
over the mission’s lifetime.

15.4.1 The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN)

An example of a service-provided ground system is the Air Force Satellite Control
Network, AFSCN, a major ground system operated by the United States Air Force. It
has 8 ground stations, called Automated Remote Tracking Stations (RTS), located
throughout the world. Six of these are dual stations, able to support 2 spacecraft simul-
taneously. These stations communicate with 2 central facilities or nodes, called the
Consolidated Space Test Center (CSTC) in Sunnyvale, California, and the Consolidat-
ed Space Operations Center (CSOC) at Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado, through an
array of ground links and communications satellites, including DSCS, GE, and Intel-
sat. Each user mission’s SOCC, POCC, and MCC are generally combined into a single
MCC at one of the central nodes, with facilities including computers and software for
both operations and planning.

Table 15-4 lists locations and key parameters for the AFSCN stations. To support
spacecraft links, each station has 18 m and 14 m parabolic antennas, with RF and data-
handling equipment for TT&C and mission data. The system of RF links with

638 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.4

spacecraft is known as the S-band Space-Ground Link Subsystem (SGLS).* The down-
links provide telemetry and mission data rates (signaling bit rates) up to 1.024 Mbps.
The uplinks permit command rates of 2 kbps. Most RTSs also support non-SGLS
downlinks at data rates up to 5 Mbps. The network has strong antijam and survival
capabilities.

TABLE 15-4. AFSCN Ground Stations. Six of the Remote Tracking Stations (RTS) are dual
sites, capable of supporting two spacecraft simultaneously. See Chap. 13 for
explanation of communications parameters G/T and EIRP.

* The SGLS incorporates 20 distinct and paired uplink and downlink channels. Uplink, or
command channels, are in the 1,750 to 1,850 MHz range, and downlink channels are from
2,200 to 2,300 MHz. Each channel consists of a single uplink carrier and two downlink
carriers which can be received simultaneously by an RTS to provide range and range rate,
spacecraft telemetry, and mission data.

15.4 Alternatives To Building a Dedicated System 639

15.4.2, NASA Tracking and
Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS)

Although it is not literally a ground support network, the TDRSS is the current
support system for NASA satellites. Becoming operational in the mid-1980s, it
replaced most of the Ground Space Tracking and Data Network. With its constellation
of 3 geosynchronous relay satellites, the system can support up to 20 subsynchronous
satellites with multiple-access S-band links, and two each single-access links at
S-band and at Ku-band. The multiple-access links support satellites simultaneously at
fixed frequencies of 2,106.4 MHz for the forward or command link (uplink) and
2,287.5 MHz for the return or downlink. The S-band single-access link supports one
spacecraft at a time, with a frequency between 2,025 and 2,120 MHz for the forward
path and between 2,200 and 2,300 MHz for the return path. Ku-band frequencies are
13.775 GHz forward and 15.003 GHz return.

The multiple-access links support spacecraft at lower data rates for extended
periods. They use electronic beam forming by the TDRSS and signal separation by
pseudorandom noise codes to discriminate between spacecraft. The single-access links
provide users high data rates for short periods. With any of these links, the relay satel-
lites pass signals between the user spacecraft and a single ground station located at
White Sands, New Mexico. The system provides full TT&C and mission data, but the
user spacecraft must match standard communications requirements and have standard
TT&C hardware on board.

Figures 15-9 and 15-10 show the communications system performance required of
user spacecraft. Figure 15-9 gives the spacecraft receiver G/T required for the forward
(command) link to yield a bit error rate of 10-5. Figure 15-10 illustrates how much
EIRP a user spacecraft return link must have for the same bit error rate of 10°. In
Fig. 15-10, “Power Received” refers to the power (in dBW) in the return signal at the
TDRS spacecraft without the gain of the TDRSS receive antenna. In other words, it is
the power in dBW of the user spacecraft’s return signal after the space and absorption
losses described in Chap. 13 are added to the user spacecraft’s EIRP. “Encoded data”
refers to data convolutionally encoded at rate 1/2. (See Sec. 13.3.3.) The user space-
craft’s signal power received at the TDRS must be on the curves of Fig.15-10 to reach
the Achievable Data Rate. Multiple access users must not exceed the curve by more
than 3 dB—and then only by arrangement with the TDRSS. For both figures, the
extent of the curve shows the permitted range of data rates.

The TDRSS ground station acts as a bent pipe for user command, telemetry, and
mission data. It accepts previously formatted command data and routes telemetry and
mission data to the user mission’s POCC, SOCC, and MCC through the NASA
NASCOM communications network. Although the TDRSS does not supply control
centers for user missions, we can arrange to use standardized control centers (referred
to by NASA as POCCs) at either Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Mary-
land, or at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. (These POCCs essentially
combine the ground system’s three basic control centers.) A mission may also have
unique control centers remote from the NASA sites, but it must provide the required
communications links with the NASCOM nodes at these sites.

Technical details and information on contracting to use the TDRSS are available in
a NASA document [Goddard Space Flight Center, 1984, as revised]. To learn more
about how to use the TDRSS, contact the Project Manager for Space Network, Code
452, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.

15.4.3 Commercial Ground Systems

With the mid-’90s trend for the federal government to get out of the space-related
services in general, and ground system services in particular, commercial ground

15.4 Alternatives To Building a Dedicated System 641

system services are becoming available. The earliest of these ground systems, ex-
pected to be in operation in the late 90s, are fairly small, with initial assets consisting
of two to four ground station sites and a central facility for control of the ground
stations and for command, telemetry, and scheduling interfaces to the user. The ground
stations are usually located at either or both low latitudes for spacecraft with low
inclinations, and at very high latitudes, for polar orbiting spacecraft. The operators of
some of these systems plan on providing links to government-owned or other private
assets in the future.

Initially planned to provide services for scientific satellites, these commercial
systems currently offer a mix of S-band and X-band downlink and S-band uplink
services between the spacecraft and groundstation. The S-band downlinks provide
housekeeping and payload data rates up to 10 or 15 MHz. Data rates to 150 MHz are
served by the X-band downlinks. Uplink (command) data rates generally reach to
1 MHz. Ku-band operations are planned for the near future to accommodate the very
high data rates of remote sensing spacecraft. These systems support both traditional
TDM (Time Division Multiplexed) and CCSDS (Consultative Committee For Space
Data Systems) spacecraft telemetry formats.

As a spacecraft program we might contract to use only the ground stations of one
of these commercial ground systems. However, going beyond providing merely
TT&C services, these private ground systems anticipate being able eventually to pro-
vide a full range of optional services including mission operations. After initial fixed
charges, the costs of using these systems will be based principally upon use, generally
calculated on a “per pass’ basis. It is generally expected that these systems will serve
not only the private space industry, but that Government agencies such as NASA will
turn to them as well.

The user’s primary communications with these commercial ground systems for
command, telemetry, and scheduling are usually via Internet Protocol (IP). Physical
connections can range from common low rate dialup lines to high speed dedicated
lines. When using dialup or dedicated lines, where data security and delays are not
serious problems, the ground system user may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
for efficiency. It is even feasible for spacecraft with low to medium downlink data
rates, and where security and data latency for both command and telemetry are not
critical, that the user’s link with the ground system may simply be through the ubiqui-
tous Internet “cloud.” (It is advisable to use TCP here however, since even though it
may slow down the average dataflow rate, it provides much more assurance that no
data will be lost.) The transfer of high-rate spacecraft telemetry is generally stored
locally at the station and transferred postpass by an efficient network protocol such as
FTP, or shipped on a high density digital medium. Commanding may be either real
time or store-and-forward at the system’s central facility.

Two such commercial offerings are Universal Spacenet’s Commercial Ground
Network (CGN) and the Ground Network System (GNS) being developed by Allied
Signal Technical Service Corporation. Spacenet plans to have X- and S-band stations
in Alaska and Hawaii by 1999. Information on the use of the CGN is available from
Universal Spacenet, 417 Caredean Drive, Suite A, Horsham, PA 19044. By the year
2000, Allied Signal will initially offer high latitude S- and X-Band stations in Green-
land, Alaska, and Norway. Subsequent lower latitude stations, as well as ties to other
existing stations are planned. Information on the GNS can be obtained from Allied
Signal Technical Services Corporation, PO Box 5555, One Bendix Road, Columbia,
MD 21045.

642 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.5

15.5 Key Design Considerations

Two key considerations in ground system design are the coverage required per
spacecraft and the number, locations, and variety of data users. Together, they
determine the number, location, and complexity of ground stations, of POCCs and
SOCCs, and of the links which provide communications between the various system
elements and data users.

15.5.1 Coverage Required per Spacecraft

The coverage required per spacecraft largely determines the number of ground
antennas and ground stations necessary to support a mission. Coverage refers to how
frequently and for what percentage of time a spacecraft must communicate with the
ground system. For geostationary orbits, a single ground station can provide virtually
continuous coverage. But low-Earth orbits may require many ground stations because
each station has a limited time of view. This time limitation is described in Sec. 5.3 in
which the time that the example satellite is in view of a ground station is calculated to
be 12.3 min. Note that this is almost the maximum viewing time because this is nearly
an overhead pass. The average viewing time will be considerably less than 12 min.

These short viewing times severely limit the time ground stations have to send com-
mands to and receive data from spacecraft. Consequently, the data rates employed for
these signals will depend on the amount of data to be transmitted during a pass. Most
missions need only small amounts of command data and housekeeping telemetry,
permitting low TT&C data rates, typically not more than a few kilobits per second.
Usually, only a few seconds are needed to transmit commands. But we must often
dump stored mission data to a ground station at high rates to transfer all the data in the
available viewing time. Thus, limited ground station view times can create the most
severe requirements on the performance of the space-to-ground communications link.

We can understand this requirement for high data rates for dumped data by assum-
ing that the example spacecraft produces and stores on-board mission data at a 1 Mbps
rate (a moderate rate for an Earth sensing spacecraft), for dump to the station once per
orbit. The required rate for dumping data is the ratio of total stored data to available
dump time of 12.3 minutes:

(105 min x 1 x 10° bps) 6
ee = 8.54 10° b
12.3 min Ps (15-1)

This is a rather high data rate. For any shorter viewing time, the rate will be even
higher, requiring more performance of the space-to-ground link.

We can reduce this rate only by having enough stations symmetrically about the
Earth to ensure a total dump time of more than 12.3 min per orbit. This would require
many stations. Having only a few stations also increases the amount of data which
must be stored on board, requiring more storage capacity to prevent loss of data from
overflow. And, as we have seen, more stored data requires even higher dump rates to
a limited number of ground stations.

Having only a few ground stations also significantly reduces spacecraft coverage
for TT&C and for receiving mission data transmitted in real time. Because the
amounts of data per pass are usually small, pass duration is not of much concern for
TT&C. However, a mission’s need for frequent TT&C contact, the lack of onboard
command storage (spacecraft autonomy), and the requirement to receive real-time
mission data typically demand more ground stations.

15.5 Key Design Considerations 643

A dedicated ground system usually cannot have many symmetrically distributed
ground stations, but we can increase their number by using hybrid configurations of
various service-provided systems. In all cases, we must trade off the number of
contacts needed with the spacecraft against the limited number of possible ground
stations and the severe geographical and political restraints on their location.

15.5.2 Number, Locations, and Variety of Data Users

The data users’ requirements determine the complexity of distribution systems.
Data users frequently need different portions of spacecraft data streams with different
requirements for handling, so data handling must be efficient and flexible. A typical
approach is to sketch out the processing functions needed to supply data to users in a
block diagram. The input to each diagram is the data stream from the data recovery
equipment. We trace the data through each block, branch off the points where each
user’s data is available, and indicate any further handling or processing. We also show
data rates at the input and output of each block. The final rate of the data stream to be
sent to each user determines the bandwidth of the communication link.

Figure 15-11 shows the processing which might be applied to data from a scientific
spacecraft, with data from the three onboard instruments combined into one data
stream for transmission to the ground. We assume that three data users exist, each
receiving all of the data from a particular instrument and “quick look” data—particu-
lar words—from each of the other instruments’ data streams. For each user, the figure
shows the data-handling functions and the rate at which the communication link must
send data. Once we have selected the appropriate block diagram, we can fill in details
at higher design levels.

a spacecraft must often be separated and recombined for relay to different users.
The required communications link capacity may be seen explicitly. See text for
discussion.

The users’ location and variety also determine whether the individual ground
stations or the central facility handles the data. Again, we must trade off the number,
bandwidth, and complexity of the required data links against costs for procuring and

644 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.5

maintaining the handling equipment. For smaller ground systems, it is often best to
send data directly from the ground stations but in more complex systems, we usually
prefer to distribute data from the central facility.
