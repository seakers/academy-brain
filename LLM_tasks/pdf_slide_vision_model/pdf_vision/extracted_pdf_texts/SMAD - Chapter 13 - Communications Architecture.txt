A communications architecture is the arrangement, or configuration, of satellites
and ground stations in a space system, and the network of communication links that
transfers information between them. This chapter discusses this arrangement of links,
their operation, and their effect on system design. More detailed information on
satellite communications is available in Morgan and Gordon [1989] and Sklar [1988].

Table 13-1 lists the steps required to specify the communications architecture. The
first step is to define the mission objectives and requirements in enough detail to
evaluate and compare alternative architectures. Section 13.1 describes alternative
configurations and the criteria used in their selection.

The second step is to determine the data rates for each of the links identified in
step 1. To do this it is necessary that the required data throughput accuracy of data
transmission be specified, and whether or not there will be data processing on board
the satellite. This process is described in Sec. 13.2.

The third step is to design each link in the network, as explained in Sec. 13.3.
Principal factors are the availability of a radio frequency spectrum, coverage area of
the satellite antenna beam, and path length between satellite and ground station. These

factors in turn determine antenna size and transmitter power—the major cost drivers
in sizing the space system. The fourth step, described in Sec.13.4, provides informa-
tion to aid the reader in estimating the size and mass of the satellite antennas, and
primary power and mass of the satellite transmitters. These parameters are inputs to

the spacecraft design process described in Chap. 10, and the ground system design
process described in Chap. 15.

13.1 Communications Architecture

A communications architecture is a network of satellites and ground stations
interconnected by communication links. The term ground station is equivalent to
Earth station, ground terminal, and Earth terminal, including land mobile, airborne,
and shipborne terminals. All of these names refer to the same thing: the antenna, trans-
mitter, receiver, and control equipment required to communicate with the satellite.

Communication links allow a satellite system to function by carrying tracking,
telemetry, and command data or mission data between its elements. Figure 13-1
illustrates the ground station-to-satellite uplinks, satellite-to-ground station downlinks,
and satellite-to-satellite crosslinks, or intersatellite links, that support a space system.
Not shown are additional communication links which may be necessary to transfer
data between the ground stations and a mission control center or users. For example,
the Air Force’s Satellite Control Network uses the DSCS-III communications satellite
to relay data between remote tracking stations and the satellite control facility in
California.

In space systems, the transmitter and receiver must be in view of each other, using
frequencies high enough (above 100 MHz) to easily penetrate the Earth’s ionosphere.

13.1 Communications Architecture 535

A satellite in a nongeostationary orbit is often out of view of its user’s ground station.
In this case a second satellite, usually in a geostationary orbit, may be used to relay
data between the satellite and its ground station. The ground station-to-satellite link is
the forward link, and the satellite-to-ground station link is the return link. As shown in
the figure, both the forward and return links contain uplinks, downlinks, and
crosslinks.

Interconnected with Communications Links.

Since 1990, several new classes of satellites in the orbital category of low-Earth
orbit (LEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) have been developed for various com-
mercial uses. They will be used for both satellite-based cellular telephone service as
well as for wideband data trunking (fiber optic type service where there is no fiber)
and data distribution for Internet-type services.

In these new systems, the terms forward link and return link sometimes take on new
definitions. As in terrestrial cellular, the forward link for a satellite-based cellular
system is from the ground station (gateway) to the user terminal (UT) or radio-
telephone, and the return link is from the radiotelephone to the ground station. In this
terminology, both the forward and return links contain uplinks and downlinks to and
from the satellite.

A constellation at an altitude of 1,000-1,500 km typically requires from 48 to 64
satellites to provide complete Earth coverage. A constellation at 10,000 km typically
requires 12 satellites.

13.1.1 Communications Architecture Defined by Satellite-Ground
Station Geometry

The geometry formed by satellite orbits and ground stations determines the basic
communications architectures illustrated in Fig. 13-2. Table 13-2 lists the principal
advantages and disadvantages of each.

Requirements. Table 13-2 summarizes the characteristics of each architecture.

Store and Forward (Fig. 13-2A): The architecture for relaying communications by
satellite appeared in 1960, when the U.S. Army launched the Courier satellite [Mott-
ley, 1960]. In this configuration, the satellite orbits at low altitude (under 1,000 km),
receives data, and stores it in memory. When it moves in view of a receiver ground
station, the satellite transmits the stored data. This architecture permits the use of a
low-cost launch vehicle due to the low-altitude orbit. The satellite cost is also lower

¢ Polar coverage with inclined orbit high link availability

due to the wider antenna beamwidth required to illuminate the Earth, which reduces
the satellite antenna size and stabilization requirement. Usually satellite stationkeep-
ing is not required. The principal disadvantage of this architecture is its long access
time and transmission delay, perhaps hours, waiting for the satellite to pass into view
of the user ground station.

There are several commercial systems planning to use store-and-forward commu-
nication for very low-cost service. They include ORBCOMM, Starsys, Vita, LEO-1,
FAI, and ESat. They typically operate in the VHF portion of the radio spectrum at very
low bandwidths. These are sometimes referred to as “little LEOs.”

Geostationary Orbit (Fig. 13-2B): Virtually all communication relay satellite
systems and many meteorological satellites use this architecture, in which the satellite
is placed in a near-zero deg inclination orbit at 35,786 km altitude. The period of the
orbit is exactly equal to the period of the Earth’s rotation, making the satellite appear
stationary when viewed from the ground (see Sec. 6.1). The cost of ground stations is
usually less for this architecture because little or no antenna pointing control is

538 Communications Architecture 13.1

required. A stationary network is far easier to set up, monitor, and control compared
to a dynamic network containing nonstationary (relative to Earth) satellites. There is
no need to switch from one satellite to another, for the satellite is always in view of the
ground station. Principal disadvantages are lack of coverage above 70-deg latitude and
the high launch cost. Furthermore, the delay time for propagation to and from the
synchronous orbit is about 0.25 sec, which sometimes causes problems (echoes,
acknowledgment protocols) in communications satellite systems.

Molniya Orbit (Fig. 13-2C): The Russian space program uses this architecture to
cover the northern polar regions. The satellites are in highly elliptical orbits with an
apogee of 40,000 km, a perigee of 500 km, and an inclination angle of 63.4 deg (see
Sec. 6.1). The apogee is over the North Pole to cover northern latitudes. The period of
the orbit is 12 hr, but because it is highly elliptical, the satellite spends about 8 hr of
each period over the northern hemisphere. Two or more satellites orbit in different
planes, phased so that at least one is always in view from all northern latitudes.
Unfortunately, the Molniya orbit requires continuous changing of antenna pointing
angles at the ground station and switching links between satellites as they move in and
out of view.

Geostationary Orbit with Crosslink (Fig. 13-2D): When a geostationary satellite is
beyond line-of-sight of a ground station, a second geostationary satellite relays data
between it and the station. A relay satellite is better than a double-hop link using two
adjacent ground stations as a relay (shown in Fig. 13-2B), because the relay ground
stations must often be on foreign territory, which is more costly, less secure, and less
survivable. The obvious disadvantage of this architecture is the added relay satellite
and its crosslink, which increase the system’s complexity, risk, and cost.

Low Altitude (Fig. 13-2E): This architecture places 20 or more satellites in low-
altitude (500 to 3,000 km) orbits and sometimes connects them with crosslinks. The
system divides digital messages into packets of a few hundred or thousand bits, labels
each packet with time-of-day and its destination, and then transmits it in a short burst.
Packets may arrive by different paths with different propagation times, depending on
the satellite-ground station geometry at the time of transmission. The receiving station
must sort and reassemble the packets in the correct order to obtain the original mes-
sage. Because so many alternate paths are available, the system is highly survivable.
The low-altitude orbit also improves immunity to jamming from the ground since the
satellite sees a smaller Earth area. Finally, the uplink transmitter power is lower due to
the shorter distance between ground station and satellite, making unauthorized recep-
tion less probable. On the other hand, this architecture needs complex network
synchronizing and control functions because of relative motion between satellites and
ground stations. Without stationkeeping, the satellites may drift together in bunches,
leaving gaps in the coverage which lead to significant link outages.

Note: The satellite-based cellular telephone service mentioned in paragraph 13.1
and Table 13-2 and below do not use packet transmission as described above, but typ-
ically CDMA or TDMA waveforms.

There are several classes of nongeostationary, low- and medium-altitude satellites
which have begun to appear since about 1990. These are:

¢ Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Cellular Satellites. These are the systems such as
Iridium, Globalstar, and Ellipso which provide cellular telephone-type service
to hand-held and mobile phones from the low-Earth orbits.

13.1 Communications Architecture 539

* Little Low-Earth Orbit (Little LEO) Satellites. These satellites, including
Starsys, Vita, LEO-1, FAI, and ESat, are commercial, low-powered, low-orbit
satellites intended for store-and-forward communication at a very low price at
VHF frequencies.

* Medium-Orbit (MEO) Satellites. These include ICO, Star Lynx, Pentriad,
Ellipsat, and TRW Global EHF Satellite Network. They provide cellular as
well as high-speed data transfer service.

¢ Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Data Satellites (also called “Big LEOs”). These
include Teledesic, Boeing’s Aeronautical Radio Navigation, Globalstar GS-
40, and Iridium Macrocell. These satellites will provide digital data trunking
as well as Internet access to many users.

Other architectures may meet particular mission requirements. For example,
Chapell [1987] suggests a hybrid system which contains satellites at both low and high
altitudes, thus combining their advantages. Lee [1988] compares three architectures
for providing regional communications satellite service to the continental United
States. These architectures contain four geostationary satellites, which are either
isolated, interconnected by double-hop ground stations, or interconnected by
crosslinks.

Some systems combine geostationary and low-Earth orbit satellites. Alcatel’s Sky-
bridge combined with Loral’s Cyberstar and Globalstar’s GS-2 systems both combine
low-Earth orbit satellites for primary customer connection and geostationary satellites
to act as relays between LEOs, as well as connecting to some customers. The service
is typically data services such as Internet connectivity. Intersatellite links are widely
used both between low-Earth orbit satellites and between low-Earth orbit and geosta-
tionary satellites in order to perform the required communication functions.

13.1.2 Communications Architecture Defined by Function

Three types of communications architectures, shown in Fig. 13-3, are tracking,
telemetry, and command; data collection; and data relay. A point-to-point network is
used to provide a link to a single ground station. The broadcast architecture transmits
data to multiple ground stations located in different areas. This architecture requires
either a broad-beam satellite antenna, a narrow-beam antenna rapidly switching
between ground stations, or a multibeam antenna (see Sec. 13.4). In communications-
satellite applications, the satellite network control is often part of a larger
telecommunications network containing thousands or millions of users. Thus the
satellites may be shared among many nonsimultaneous users, using multiple-access
techniques described in Sec. 13.5 (see Chap. 2 of Morgan and Gordon [1989]).

The satellite communications architecture may be affected by data processing on
board the satellite. Usually data collected by a satellite is transmitted directly to the
user via the downlink. However, the data often requires processing to make it useful.
If the system contains many ground stations, processing the data in the satellite and
then transmitting it may be more economical than having each user process it separ-
ately. This processing often reduces the data rate, leading to further cost savings (see
Sec.13.2). A satellite system using onboard processing is Europe’s Meteosat, which
stores and formats cloud-scanner data before transmitting it to several ground stations
at a reduced data rate.

Open circles represent a relay satellite.

Operators at ground (air, ship) stations usually control the mission in (near) real
time by transmitting commands to the satellite. When the satellite is not in view of the
ground-control station during part of its orbit, commands previously received and
stored in the satellite are executed by an onboard timer. The advantages of this
approach are flexibility to changing requirements, greater reliability, and a less
complex, lower-cost satellite. The disadvantages are vulnerability to human error or
failure of the ground control facility. Costs for the ground control segment, especially
operations, can be high.

On the other hand, the satellite itself can control a mission by using onboard data-
sensing and programmed decision-making processes. This arrangement replaces
ground control, is highly survivable, has fast response time (communication link
delays eliminated), excludes errors introduced by human operators, and reduces
ground equipment and operations cost. But it is less responsive to changing or unan-

13.1 Communications Architecture 541

ticipated requirements, and the satellite itself is more complex, more costly, and
potentially less reliable. Even when using an autonomous control architecture, a
ground station is generally required to collect data from the spacecraft and to serve as
a backup to the onboard control system.

Usually, ground stations control unmanned satellites to simplify the satellite
design. In the future we expect more functions, such as stationkeeping, to be
performed in the satellite to reduce the dependence on the ground station control (see
Sec. 16.1).

During the operation of a satellite system, the communication links may need to be
reconfigured, or its parameters, such as power or bandwidth, adjusted to accommodate
a change in requirements. The process for doing this is called network control.
Communications architectures may require a number of control functions
(Table 13-3). Early satellites, such as Sputnik, did not need these functions because
their systems used only one satellite, a single satellite-to- ground link, and a broadbeam
antenna. On the other hand, a communications satellite system such as the NASA
ACTS [Naderi and Kelly, 1988] contains many narrowbeam satellite antennas with
demodulators and switching circuits. This architecture requires a sophisticated system
for network control. Network control can be centralized using a single ground station
or satellite, or distributed with multiple ground stations or satellites. Distributed con-
figurations use a control hierarchy, or set of priorities, to avoid conflicts. Distributed
control makes the network less vulnerable to failure of a single control element (see
Chap. 14 for further details).

13.1.3 Criteria for Selecting Communications Architecture

Individual users will assign different priorities to the criteria for selecting a
communications architecture. For example, a commercial company will try to reduce
cost and risk, but the military may make survivability the top priority. The factors
which affect the criteria are explained below:

Orbit: The satellite orbit determines how much time the satellite is in view by the
ground station and the potential need for intersatellite links. The satellite altitude
determines the Earth coverage, and the satellite orbit determines the delay between
passes over a specified ground station. Together, orbit and altitude set the number of
satellites needed for a specified continuity of coverage (see Sec. 7.2). Transmitter
power and antenna size depend on the distance between the satellites and the ground
stations (see Sec. 13.3). Satellite view time determines the signal-acquisition and
mission-control complexity (see Chap. 14).

In the satellite-cellular systems described above, intersatellite links are not neces-
sarily used. Instead, the constellation is designed so that at least one satellite is in view
by the gateway and every user at all times, so that there are no “outages.” Coverage is
determined by the number of satellites, the inclination of their orbits, the latitude of the
gateway and user, and the number of gateways located around the world, if intersatel-
lite links are not used.

If intersatellite links are used, then the number of gateways and their location
becomes much less critical, as many satellites can connect to a single gateway through
intersatellite links. Various systems proceeding now have used different philosophies
with respect to intersatellite links, which can have great effect on the capital cost of the
system. Intersatellite links make the satellites more expensive, but eliminate the need
for many fairly expensive ground stations (gateways), for example.

There are many systems proposed in various frequency bands which use not only
the geostationary orbit, the low-Earth orbit discussed above, and also what is called a
medium-Earth orbit (MEO), which ranges in altitude from about 10,000 to 20,000 km.
These are typically inclined with respect to the equator as the LEOs are, and can
address users with small, hand-held UTs, but can see a much larger portion of the Earth
at one time, so that only 10 or 12 of them are required to give nearly complete Earth
coverage.

RF Spectrum: The RF carrier frequency affects the satellite and ground station
transmitter power, antenna size and beamwidth, and requirements for satellite stabili-
zation. In turn, these factors affect satellite size, mass, and complexity. The carrier
frequency also determines the transmitter power needed to overcome rain attenuation
(see Sec. 13.3). Finally, it is necessary to apply for and receive permission to use an
assigned frequency from a regulatory agency such as the International Telecommuni-
cation Union, the Federal Communications Commission, or the Department of
Defense’s Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee, and every nation’s regulatory
agency. These agencies also allocate orbit slots for geostationary satellites (Chap. 21).

Data Rate: The data rate is proportional to the quantity of information per unit time
transferred between the satellite and ground station (see Sec. 13.2). The higher the data
rate, the larger the transmitter power and antenna size required (Sec. 13.3). Processing
the spacecraft-generated data on board the satellite reduces the data rate without losing
essential information, but makes the satellite more complex (see Sec. 13.2).

Duty Factor: The fraction of time needed for operation of a satellite link is the duty
factor, which is a function of the mission and the satellite orbit. A low duty factor

13.2 Data Rates 543

enables a single ground station to support more than one satellite (usually the case for
telemetry and command). Alternatively, several users may share a single satellite link
(see Sec. 13.5).

In the case of LEOs used for cellular service, one gateway will typically have
several antennas communicating simultaneously with several satellites, each of which
may be carrying 1,000 or more individual circuits. In this case, the ground station duty
factor will be nearly 100% as antennas switch from satellite to satellite; the UT use
factor will be quite small, however, as is the use of a telephone.

Link Availability: Link availability is the time the link is available to the user
divided by the total time that it theoretically could be available. It depends on equip-
ment reliability, use of redundant equipment, time required to repair equipment, out-
ages caused by rain, and use of alternate links. Typical goals for link availability range
from 0.99 to 0.9999, the latter value applying to commercial telephone networks. (See
Chap. 19 for a discussion of reliability.)

Link Access Time: The maximum allowable link access time, or time users have to
wait before they get their link, depends on the mission. For example, we usually
demand access to a voice circuit in seconds. Meteorological data is needed in less than
an hour to be useful in weather forecasting. On the other hand, X-ray data from a
scientific satellite can be stored and transmitted later. Tracking, telemetry, and
command links are often required in near real-time (a few seconds), especially if a
problem requires an immediate response from the satellite-control operator. Link
access time depends strongly on orbit selection, which determines when a satellite is
in view of the ground station. Note that a real-time response is impossible for deep
space missions, because the radio propagation time is minutes or hours long.

Threat: Various kinds of threats may influence system design. For military
applications, choices of frequency, antenna, modulation, and link margin need to be
evaluated for susceptibility to jamming. At the same time, a high-altitude nuclear
detonation can disturb the propagation of radio signals. A physical threat to the
satellite might dictate multiple satellites or a hardened design (see Chap. 8). A physical
threat to a ground station might demand a data-relay satellite with crosslinks to allow
the ground station to be relocated in safe territory.

The FireSat sample mission uses low-altitude satellites with limited coverage. If a
ground station is near the forest area under surveillance, a store-and-forward or
crosslink architecture is not required. The communications architecture is then simply
a single satellite operating when in view of its ground station. A separate ground
station is required for each major area under surveillance.

13.2 Data Rates

In designing a communications architecture for space missions, we must ask: what
is the information to be transferred over our communication links? How fast must the
transfer rate be? Keeping in mind that higher rates of data transmission mean higher
system costs, we need to decide how we will transfer information to the user.

Satellite links originally used analog modulation techniques to apply the data onto
the RF carrier for transmission over the link. Since 1980, however, most space-ground
communication links use digital modulation. To implement a digital system, we must
first sample the amplitude of the analog signal at a rate equal to at least twice the high-
est frequency in the signal spectrum, f,,,. In 1928 Nyquist” showed that if we meet this

544 Communications Architecture 13.2

condition we can theoretically reconstruct the original analog signal from the samples
(see Sklar [1988], Sec. 2.4). For example, the normal human voice has a frequency
spectrum range of about 3.5 kHz. Thus, to reproduce it digitally, the sampling rate
must be at least 7,000 samples/sec. However, practical considerations, such as realiz-
able filter limitations, suggest that the sampling frequency should be at least 2.2 times
the maximum input frequency [Sklar, 1988]:

Se2 2.2 fin (13-1)

Using Eq. (13-1), our 3.5-kHz voice signal must be sampled at a rate of
7.7 ksamples/s. In fact, the sampling rate of commercial digitized voice systems is
8 ksamples/s. Another example is the sampling rate of the audio compact disc player
which is 44.1 ksamples/s—about 2.2 times 20 kHz, the maximum source frequency of
interest for high-quality music.

The analog amplitude sample is next converted to a digitized word composed of a
series of bits. Consider the analog-to-digital converter process illustrated in Fig. 13-4,
where three bits designate one of eight amplitude levels. For example, a 6.3 V ampli-
tude converts to a 3-bit word—110. At the receiver, a digital-to-analog converter
converts this word according to the algorithm 22 + 21 + 0° + 0.5 = 6.5 V, leaving a
quantization error of 0.2 V. This quantization error can be reduced by increasing the
number of bits in the word.

The analog-to-digital converter divides the total amplitude range of the input
sample into M quantizing levels, where M = 2”, and n is the number of bits per sample.
Assuming a uniform spacing of quantization levels, the maximum quantization error
is 0.5 AV where AV is the quantization step size, equal to Vyp / M = Vpp / 2", where
Vpp is the full-scale input signal voltage.

* Harry Nyquist set the stage for modern digital communications with his classic paper, “Cer-
tain Topics on Telegraph Transmission Theory,” published in the Transactions of American
Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1928 (vol. 47, pp. 617-644).

13.2 Data Rates 545

It can be shown [Panter, 1965] that the mean-squared noise power due to quan-
tization is (AV)2/12. The signal-to-quantization noise power ratio is (M2 — 1), which
is approximately equal to M2 or 22”, assuming a uniform distribution of the input
signal amplitudes over Vpp. See Table 13-4."

TABLE 13-4. Required Bits Per Sample. The number of bits per sample is determined by the
maximum quantization error and quantization noise allowed.

Maximum Signal Power to Quantization
Number of Quantization Error Noise Power Ratio”

* Assumes signal amplitudes and quantization errors are uniformly distributed.

The effect of quantization noise may be reduced by varying the size of the
quantization steps, without adding to their number, so as to provide smaller steps for
weaker signals. For a given number of quantization levels, coarser quantization is
applied near the peak of large signals, where the larger absolute errors are tolerable
because they are small compared to the larger signal amplitudes. These techniques are
commonly applied to voice transmission, where the speech waveform is compressed
at the transmitter end prior to digitization, and expanded at the receiver. Taken
together, the compressor and expander are called a compandor.

The number of bits per sample is determined by the mission requirements. The Jet
Propulsion Laboratory typically uses 256 shades of gray (i.e., n = 8) in differentiating
voltages from its imaging sensors, and 32 (n = 5) is normally used for low-definition,
black-and-white TV transmission. The length of the digital word selected depends on
the precision one requires for the application. For example, we do not need this preci-
sion for satellite equipment temperatures, whereas scientific measurement may require
a highly precise data link, if justified by the sensor accuracy.

The data rate is the number of samples per second times the bits per sample, or the
number of bits per second, abbreviated bps. Thus a digitized voice circuit in a com-
mercial telephone network requires 8 ksamples/s times 8 bits/sample for a data rate of
64 kbps. Table 13-5 lists other examples.

The cellular-satellite systems are using methods for modulation, demodulation, and
forward error correction that greatly reduce the data rates needed for transmission. For
example, the Globalstar system uses code division multiple access with Reed-
Solomon coding for forward error correction and Viterbi decoding. It sends voice
through a variable-rate encoder/decoder at an average rate of 9.6 kb/s, and can reduce
toa 4.8, 2.4 or 1.2 kb/s rate under stress. These rates are much less than those discussed
above, and in Table 13-5, and represent new methods of coding digital data. With these

new codes it is possible to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of about 10-!° at a bit energy
to incremental noise (E},/N, ) ratio of only 5 dB.

Digital communication techniques are used instead of analog for a number of
reasons. First, digital signals can more precisely transmit the data because they are less
susceptible to distortion and interference. Second, digital signals can be easily
regenerated so that noise and disturbances do not accumulate in transmission through
communication relays. Third, digital links can have extremely low error rates and high
fidelity through error detection and correction. Also, multiple streams of digital
signals can be easily multiplexed as a single serial-bit stream onto a single RF carrier.
Other advantages are easier communication-link security and implementation by drift-
free miniature, low-power hardware, including microprocessors, digital switching,
and large scale integrated circuit chips. In this chapter we will consider only digital
communications.

Using the formulas developed in Chap. 5, we can easily determine the relationship
between the quantity of data, D, the data rate, R, and the parameters for a single ground
station pass from Sec. 5.3.1. Specifically,

D= RFT pax ~ Tinitiate ) iM (13-2)

FH=(L/Angy) @C0S(COSA ng, | COSAmin ) (13-3)

where T,,,,, is the maximum time in view (i.e., the pass duration when the satellite
passes directly overhead) from Eq. (5-52), F is the fractional reduction in viewing time
due to passing at an Earth central angle A,,,;, away from the ground station, A,,,, is the
maximum Earth central angle from Eq. (5-36), Tjnisiare is the time required to initiate
a communications pass, and M is the margin needed to account for missed passes due
to ground station down time, sharing of ground resources, transmission of other data,
or conflicts on board the satellite or within the communications process. A reasonable
value for Tynitiare is about 2 minutes. M is conservatively estimated at a value of 2 to 3
unless it is a dedicated ground station with a specified value for the percentage of pass

13.2 Data Rates 547

time that will be used for collecting data. For the fraction of time in view, we may wish
to use mean values rather than one for a specific ground station pass in Eq. (13-3). As
discussed in Sec. 5.3.1, the average value of F is about 80% for satellites in a circular
low-Earth orbit, and 86% or more of all passes will have F greater than 0.5.

With this background on digital techniques, we now consider the data rate require-
ments for the three types of architectures discussed in the previous section: telemetry,
tracking, and command (TT&C); data collection; and data relay.

13.2.1 TT&C

The number and accuracy of functions being monitored in the satellite determines
the telemetry data rate. Several hundred functions such as voltages, temperatures, and
accelerations may require monitoring to determine if all satellite subsystems are
operating correctly, and, if not, to determine where a failure occurred. Sampling each
telemetry sensor in sequence with a multiplexer combines all telemetry data into a
single bit stream. The sampling rate is usually low, perhaps once every second or once
every 10 sec, because the monitored parameters vary slowly. For example, suppose we
want to monitor 50 temperature sensors and 50 voltages once every 10 sec with an
accuracy of 1.5%. The data rate required is 100 samples per 10 sec times 5 bits per
sample, or 50 bps. Some applications require precise time or amplitude resolution of
the data. In these cases, the data may be transmitted in analog form by frequency mod-
ulation of one or more subcarriers [Morgan and Gordon, 1989].

The rate needed to transmit commands to a satellite is usually quite low—perhaps
only one per second. A command message may be 48 to 64 bits long, consisting of a
synchronizing preamble (a set series of bits), an address word that routes the command
to its satellite destination, the command itself (often a single on-off digit), and some
error detection bits to make sure the command was correctly received. Some com-
mands can cause irreversible functions or damage the satellite if performed at the
wrong time. These commands are usually first transmitted and stored in the satellite.
Correct reception by the satellite is verified by telemetry, after which a second com-
mand is transmitted to execute the function. If the command is to be executed later
when the satellite is out of the ground station’s view, a time of execution is added to
the command word and stored in the satellite. The command is executed later when
the time contained in the command word coincides with the satellite’s clock time.

To track a satellite, the ground station measures range or range rate for computing
and updating the orbit ephemeris. For example, the Air Force adds a one Mbps
pseudorandom (PN) code to the command link. The satellite command receiver
extracts this code. It is then retransmitted as part of the telemetry downlink signal. The
ground station measures the arrival time of the code relative to its uplink transmission
time to determine the round-trip delay, from which the range is computed. NASA’s
Goddard Range and Range Rate system operates the same way except it uses several
harmonically related sinusoidal tones plus a pseudorandom code. Intelsat uses only
four ranging tones.

In most cases we would want to use an existing TT&C ground station network.
Table 13-6 summarizes the key parameters of four networks (see Chaps. 11 and 15 for
additional details). The ratio of downlink-to-uplink frequencies listed in the table
applies when the satellite transmitter is phased-locked to the received uplink carrier.
This mode allows the Doppler frequency shift of the RF carrier to be accurately
measured at the ground station to determine the range rate. The United States has
NASA’s Deep Space Network and the Air Force’s Satellite Control Network. Intelsat

548 Communications Architecture 13.2

and other communications satellite operators use their own TT&C system, which
eliminates the need to pay for the services of a larger network. The TT&C require-
ments for FireSat are quite modest and can easily be handled by its own system, except
during the launch phase.

which provides an alternative to ground stations for supporting the TT&C link [Yuen,
1983]. The orbit of the user satellite must be below synchronous altitude to be in view
of the TDRS antennas.

13.2.2 Data Collection

In the second type of network, a satellite sensor, such as an optical or radar scanner,
collects data. This data is transmitted to the ground station for processing and viewing
by the user. The pictures of global cloud cover on the evening television news come
from a satellite sensor. Although we could include the sensor data as part of the telem-
etry data discussed above, we usually consider the sensor data separately when the
sensor data rate is greater than 100 kbps or so. Data rate requirements for payload
sensors are discussed in Sec. 9.5.5.

Table 13-7 lists the data rates for two satellite-sensor configurations. One example
is a geostationary satellite with a radiometer which scans the entire Earth in 20 min
with 1 km resolution. Here the data rate is 1.42 Mbps, similar to a meteorological sat-
ellite such as GOES.

On the other hand, using Eq. (9-23), we calculate the FireSat data rate to be
85 Mbps—too high for any practical, cost-effective system. Let us review the Fire-
Sat mission requirements. First, we need to scan 150,000 acres (about 25 km by 25
km) in 4 min with 30 m resolution. By limiting the sensor coverage to the 150,000-acre
area under surveillance as the satellite passes overhead, the sensor output rate would
be only 2,900 pixels per second,” for a data rate of 39 kbps (for 1.6 samples per

13.2 Data Rates 549

pixel, 8 bits per sample and g = 0.95). This rate is far more attractive for practical
designs. We could also use some form of data processing on board the satellite, as
discussed below.

TABLE 13-7. Data Requirement for Two Example Sensor-Satellite Systems. For FireSat the
satellite ground track velocity provides scanning of the ground.

n =Number bits/sample 8 8
q =Frame efficiency 0.95 0.95
R = Date rate - bps 85 x 106 1.42 x 106

In many cases we do not need all data collected by the satellite’s sensor. For
example, our FireSat data is of no interest unless the sensor observes heat from a forest
fire. Onboard data processing can be used to dramatically reduce the required data
rates. For FireSat, onboard processing would consist of selecting and transmitting only
those pixels receiving thermal energy above a specified temperature. The amount of
data-rate reduction depends on the portion of the observed area that is burning. We
must also insert extra bits to identify the position of the pixels or groups of pixels in
the scan. Such data processing can reduce the data rate by a factor of 3 to 10 or more,
depending on the nature of the data.

Another technique for reducing the data rate is to transmit only the changes in the
amplitude of the data samples. For example, the amplitude of the first pixel in a frame
of data could be transmitted by an 8-bit word. Changes in amplitude of subsequent
pixels, relative to the previous pixel amplitude, are then transmitted as 3-bit words,
thus reducing the data rate by 3/8.

Considerable effort has gone into reducing, or compressing, the data rate of a digi-
tized voice channel [O’Shaughnessy, 1987]. One technique is Adaptive Differential
Pulse Code Modulation, which transmits the difference between the actual voice
sample and a predicted value based on several previous samples. Data rates have been
reduced from 64 to 32 or 16 kbps using these techniques while maintaining commer-
cial toll-quality voice. Even greater reduction in data rates have been achieved with
Vocoders and Linear Predictive Coders. With this method, receivers use transmitted
spectral or excitation parameters to control a voice synthesizer. It requires a data rate
of only 600 bps to 2,400 bps, but the voice often sounds unnatural. Voice-excited
vocoders combine the best features of the approaches described above, producing a
reasonably natural-sounding voice channel with a data rate of 4,800 or 9,600 bps
{Gerson, 1990}.

550 Communications Architecture 13.3

Reducing the data rate by processing or compression on board the satellite
decreases the required transmitter power, significantly reducing satellite mass. (Data
processing or compression uses VLSI circuits, which add little to satellite mass.)
Instead of reducing the satellite mass, the ground stations can be made smaller with
increased mobility and lower cost. A lower rate link can also better survive jamming.
However, a compressed signal is less tolerant to bit errors, thus negating some of the
advantages listed above. We expect increased use of data compression in the future as
performance improves and cost decreases.

13.2.3 Data Relay

Most communications satellites and data-relay satellites simply retransmit the data
received through a receiver-transmitter combination called a transponder. The total
bandwidth capacities of three communication satellites are in Table 13-8. (See
Table 13-6 for the TDRS capacities.) Transponder bandwidths of commercial geosta-
tionary communication satellites are usually 36 MHz or 72 MHz. (These transponders
are repeaters. See Sec. 13.5 for a description of the processing transponder.

TABLE 13-8. Relay Bandwidth Capabilities of Representative Communication Satellites.
The maximum data rate can be several times the bandwidth, depending on the
modulation and ground station size. The first entry for Intelsat-V is read as 4
transponders at 36 MHz and 1 transponder at 41 MHz. The tota/ relay bandwidth
is calculated by multiplying the number of transponders by their bandwidth and
adding them together.

The cellular satellites have much different bandwidths. For example, Globalstar has
16.5 MHz transponder channels to accommodate 13 of the CDMA 1.23 MHz chan-
nels. The wideband Internet relay satellites proposed at Ka-band may have
transponders with 1 GHz bandwidths, to accommodate multiple 155 Mbps channels
for trunking Internet data between computers. The satellite communication world is
becoming much more complex.

13.3 Link Design

The overall process of link design and, subsequently, payload sizing, is summa-
rized in Table 13-9 and described in detail in this and the next section. The process for
developing the communications architecture and determining the link requirements
was detailed in Table 13-1.

To understand link design, we need to define the relationship between data rate,
antenna size, propagation path length, and transmitter power. This relationship is

compute the signal-to-noise ratio of the communications system. The basic equation
used in sizing a digital data link is

where E,/N, is the ratio of received energy-per-bit to noise-density, P is the transmitter
power, L; is the transmitter-to-antenna line loss, G, is the transmit antenna gain, L, is
the space loss, L, is transmission path loss, G, is the receive antenna gain, k is Boltz-
mann’s constant, 7; is the system noise temperature, and R is the data rate. The
propagation path length between transmitter and receiver determines L,, whereas L, is
a function of factors such as rainfall density. In most cases, an E;,/N, ratio between 5
and 10 is adequate for receiving binary data with low probability of error with some
forward error correction. Once we select the orbit and determine the transmitter-to-re-
ceiver distance, the major link variables which affect system cost are P, G;, G,, and R.
Rain absorption also becomés a significant factor at radio frequencies above 10 GHz.

Figure 13-5 illustrates the key relationships between power of the satellite’s
transmitter, diameter of the ground-station antenna, and data rate for the downlink.
These parameters are nearly independent of frequencies between 200 MHz and
20 GHz under clear weather conditions. The required transmitter power is relatively
independent of satellite altitude when the antenna beamwidth is set to just illuminate
the coverage area indicated. At low altitudes the required transmitter power is reduced
in the Earth coverage case because the area in view of the satellite is smaller.

between 200 MHz and 20 GHz in the absence of rain and antenna-pointing error at
the ground station.

13.3.1 Derivation of Link Equation

Consider a transmitter located at the center of a sphere of radius S, radiating power
PL, isotropically, and thus uniformly illuminating the surface of the sphere. The power
flux density, Wy, received on the sphere’s surface is the radiated power divided by the
area of the sphere, that is, PL,/4mS2.The radiated power is the transmitter power,
P, reduced by the line loss, L;, between the transmitter and the antenna.

If the transmitting antenna has a narrow beamwidth, the power flux density is
increased by the transmitting antenna gain, G,, defined as the ratio of power radiated
to the center of the coverage area to the power radiated by an isotropic (omni-
directional) antenna. The received flux density is reduced by the transmission path
loss, Lg, which includes atmospheric and rain absorption. The power flux density then
becomes:

PL,G,L EIRP)L,
p =e (13-5)
4ns 4ns

where Wr is typically expressed in W/m2. PL,G, is called the effective isotropic
radiated power, or EIRP, in watts. In Fig. 13-6, the same E/RP and received power
flux density is produced two ways, one using a high-power transmitter, the other a
low-power transmitter. The difference between them is that the approach using a
low-power, high-gain antenna illuminates only a limited coverage area, which may or
may not meet the mission requirements.

Fig. 13-6. Trade-off between Antenna Gain and Transmitter Power. These two communica-
tion links have the same E/RP, received power density, and received signal power.
However, the 1-W transmitter with the high-gain antenna has only 1/25 the coverage
area provided by the 25-W transmitter with low-gain antenna.

The received power, C, is W; times the effective receive antenna aperture area, A,.
Here A,is equal to the physical aperture area, mD2/4, times the antenna efficiency, Nn.
The efficiency, 7, is a Figure of Merit between 0 and 1, and is a function of various
imperfections in the antenna, including deviations of the reflector surface from theo-
retical, feed losses, and aperture blockage. A typical value for parabolic antennas is
0.55, though 0.6 to 0.7 often occur in high quality, ground antennas. Substituting for
W,, from Eq. (13-5), and A,, we obtain

In digital communications, the received energy per bit, E,,is equal to the received
power times the bit duration, or

Ey =C/R (13-9)

where C is in W, R is the data rate in bps, and E, is in W's or J.

The noise power at the receiver input usually has a uniform noise spectral density,
N,, in the frequency band containing the signal. The total received noise power, N, is
then NB, where B is the receiver noise bandwidth. (B is determined by the data rate
and the choice of modulation and coding, as discussed later in this chapter.) N, and NV
are related to the system noise temperature, T,, by:

N, =kT, (13-10)
and (13-11)
N =kT,B=N,B (13-12)

where N, is in W/Hz, N is in W, k is Boltzmann’s constant = 1.380 x 10-23 J/K, T; is
in K, and B is in Hz. By combining Eqs. (13-9) and (13-10) with Eq. (13-8), we obtain
our original link equation, Eq. (13-4).

13.3.2 Link Design Equations

The link equation is a product of successive terms and, therefore, can be conve-
niently expressed in terms of decibels or dB. A number expressed in GB is just 10 logy
of the number. Thus, a factor of 1,000 is 30 dB and a factor of 0.5 is —3 db. If the
number has units, they are attached to the dB notation. For example, 100 W is 20 dBW.
Antenna gain is the ratio of radiated intensity in a specific direction to that of an
isotropic antenna radiating uniformly in all directions and, therefore, is a pure number
which should, in principle, be expressed in dB. However, we use dBi (dB relative to
isotropic) as the units for antenna gain to be consistent with standard practice in the
industry.*

Eq. (13-4) can be rewritten in decibels as

Ep/No= P + Ly + G, + Lyp + Ly + Ly + G, + 228.6 — 10 logT, - 10 logR (13-13)

where E,/N,, L;, G,, L,, Lg,Ly,, and G, are in dB, P is in dBW, T, is in K, R is in bps,
and 10 log k = —228.60 dBW/(Hz-K). This can also be written as

E,/No= EIRP + Ly, + Ly + Lg + G, + 228.6 — 10 logT, — 10 logR (13-14)

* Editor’s Note: Of course, modern computers are fully capable of multiplying real numbers
instead of adding logarithms. Like much of astronautics, this peculiar nomenclature remains
intact primarily to ensure the full employment of communications systems engineers.

13.3 Link Design 555

where the EJRP is in dBW and sensitivity of the receiving station, G,/T, = G,-
10 log T,, is expressed in dB/K. Eq. (13-14) is preferred when specifying the trans-
mitter EIRP and receiver G,/T;, separately.Note that in these equations, G, and T, must
be specified at the same point, usually the junction between the receive antenna termi-
nal and the Low Noise Amplifier.

We can find the carrier-to-noise-density-ratio, C/N, by multiplying E,/N, by
the data rate, R [see Eq. (13-9)]. Carrier power in W is the energy per bit in J times the
number of bits per second.

C/N, = E;/Ny + 10 log R (13-15a)
= (EIRP) + L, +L, + G,/T, + 228.6 (13-15b)

From Eq. (13-12), the carrier-to-noise-ratio, C/N is C/N, B or, in dB, is C/N, -
10 log B. Combining this with Eq. (13-15b):

C/N = EIRP + L, + L, + G, + 228.6 — 10 logT, —10 log B (13-16)

where B is the noise bandwidth of the receiver in Hz. C/N also equals E,/N,+ 10
log(R/B).

The Received Isotropic Power, or RIP, is the power received if the receive antenna
gain is 0 dB. If we substitute G,= 1 (0 dB) into Eq. (13-8), then C = RIP. Combining
this expression with Eq. (13-4), and converting to dB yields:

RIP = E,,/N, — G,/T,— 228.60 + 10 log R (13-17)

where RIP is in dBW. A good way to specify the receiving system performance is to
specify the bit error rate (the probability a data bit is incorrectly received) required for
a given RIP. The designer then has the freedom to trade off his demodulator design
(which determines the E/N, required to meet the specified bit error rate) against the
antenna gain and noise temperature (G,/T,) to meet the RIP specification at minimum
cost.

We can similarly convert Eq. (13-7) to dB. Using the relationship f = c/A, where c
is the velocity of light in free space ~ 3 x 108 m/s, we obtain the following equation
for the antenna gain, G, in dB:

G = 20 log 7 + 20 log D+ 20 log f+ 10 log 7 - 20 log c (13-18a)

or
G =~159.59 + 20 log D + 20 log f+ 10 log 7 (13-18b)

where G is in dB, fis in Hz, and D is in m.

For a circular antenna beam the half-power beamwidth, 9, is the angle across which
the gain is within 3 dB (50%) of the peak gain. We may estimate @ from the following
empirical relationship:

21

SGHzP
where fGy, is the carrier frequency in GHz, and D is the antenna diameter in m.*

@ in degrees (13-19)

* Equation (13-19) yields a beamwidth about 20% greater than A/D (Chap. 9). This accounts for
the nonuniform illumination of the parabola by the feed.

556 Communications Architecture 13.3

The antenna gain is approximately 27,000/@2, obtained by combining Eqs. (13-7)
and (13-19), and assuming 7) = 0.55. A noncircular antenna has an elliptical beam with
the half-power beamwidth along the major axis equal to 6, and the half-power beam-
width along the minor axis equal to @, The gain of the noncircular beam antenna can
be estimated:

G = 44.3 — 10 log(,4,) (13-20)

where @, and @, are in deg, and G is in dBi. For example, an antenna with a 1 deg by
2 deg elliptical beam has the same gain as a circular antenna with a beamwidth of
1.4 deg. Gain calculated in this manner is generally accurate to within 25% (1.2 dB)
for beamwidths less than 150 deg. The beamwidths @, or @, can be estimated from
Eq. (13-19) with D equal to the major axis or minor axis diameters.

The above gain equations are for peak gain. However, a receive antenna might not
be located at the center of the transmitter antenna beam, or vice versa. With narrow
beamwidths, small errors in pointing the antenna (introduced by wind gusts on the
ground or satellite stabilization errors, for example) can lead to significantly reduced
gain. The following equation estimates the reduction from peak gain, Lg,in dB caused
by a pointing offset from beam center:

Lg=-12(e/0)2 (13-21)

where @is the antenna half-power beamwidth, and e is the pointing error. For example,
for e equal to 6/2, the pointing loss is 3 dB. In calculating a link budget, we would
subtract this pointing loss from the antenna gain.

From Eq. (13-6) the space loss, L,, is

L,= (A /4nS)2 = (c /4nSf )2 (13-22)

Converting into dB, this gives:
L, = 20 log (3 x 108) — 20 log (41) — 20 log S — 20 log f (13-23a)
= 147.55 — 20 log S — 20 log f (13-23b)

where S is the path length in m, and fis the frequency in Hz.

The system noise temperature, T,, is the sum of a number of individual contribu-
tions from various sources. We have divided the noise sources into two groups. Those
originating ahead of the antenna aperture (e.g., in the atmosphere) we call the antenna
noise temperature, Tan,. These noise sources are external to the ground station, except
for the antenna itself, and include:

¢ Galactic noise

¢ Noise radiated by clouds and rain in the propagation path

¢ Solar noise (either in the antenna main beam or sidelobe)

¢ Presence of the Earth (typically 290 K) in a sidelobe

¢ Man-made noise (either in the antenna main beam or sidelobe)

¢ Contribution of nearby objects, buildings, radomes, etc.

¢ Temperature of blockage items in antenna subsystem such as booms or feeds

Figure 13-7 shows the estimated noise temperature from various external sources
as a function of frequency. Note the necessity of keeping the receive antenna from
pointing toward the Sun when the beamwidth is narrow (<5 deg). Otherwise the Sun
will significantly increase the antenna noise temperature.

10 MHz to 100 GHz [Ippolito, 1986).

All noise sources between the antenna terminal and the receiver output are lumped
together and called receiver noise temperature, T,.. Receiver noise originates from

* Transmission Lines and Filters—equal to (1 — L)T, where L = P,,/ P;is the ratio
of output power (P,) to input power (P;) and T is the component temperature
in K.

* Low Noise Amplifier—equal to (F — 1) 290 K, where F is the noise figure from
Eq. (13-24).

An additional contribution from subsequent amplifier stage noise exists, but is a
small contributor because it is divided by the low noise amplifier gain.

The noise figure, F, of the receiver is defined as:

F=1+ Fr (13-24)
1

where T,.is the noise temperature of the receiver itself, and 7 is a reference tempera-
ture, usually 290 K. The noise figure is often expressed in dB (that is, 10 log F). For
example, a cryogenically cooled receiver for reception of telemetry signals from a
space probe may have a noise figure of 1.1 (0.4 dB) for a noise temperature of 29 K.

558 Communications Architecture 13.3

Adding the antenna noise and receiver noise gives us the system noise temperature,
T,. To find T, we add the noise contribution of the transmission line and bandpass filter
which connect the antenna to the receiver’s low-noise amplifier. Thus:

Th(1-L Ty(F-1
Ts = Tant +[Btet) {BE-D) (13-25)

where L, is the line loss between the antenna and receiver, expressed as a power ratio.
The second term in Eq. (13-25) is the noise contribution from the transmission line,
and the third term is the contribution from the receiver. The receiver noise temperature
is the sum of these two terms. These noise temperatures are referred to the antenna
terminal by dividing by L,. Continuing with our cooled receiver example, assume the
line loss is 0.5 dB, making L, = 0.89. Then the noise contribution from the line loss is
36 K and the receiver noise is 33 K, both referred to the antenna terminal. Then T, is
Tanz + 69 K.

Table 13-10 shows typical noise temperatures for satellite systems using uncooled
receivers. When a narrow Satellite-antenna beam locks at Earth, the uplink antenna
noise temperature is the temperature of the Earth, about 290 K. In the future, im-
provements in design of low-noise amplifiers will reduce the receiver noise figures,
especially at higher frequencies.

13.3.3 Modulation and Coding

Before we can complete our link design, we need to select a modulation and coding
technique. Modulation is the process by which an input signal varies the characteristics
of a radio frequency carrier (usually a sine wave). These characteristics are amplitude,
phase, frequency, and polarization. Demodulation of the signal at the receiver consists
of measuring the variations in the characteristics of the received carrier and deducing
what the original signal was. Amplitude modulation, though common in terrestrial
services, seldom appears in satellite systems because it requires larger (and more
costly) transmitters. Phase or frequency modulation techniques are preferred, because
the transmitter can operate at saturation for maximum power efficiency.

Figure 13-8 shows the most common modulation techniques used in satellite
systems. Binary phase shift keying (BPSK) consists of setting the carrier phase at 0 deg
to transmit a binary 0, and setting the phase at 180 deg to transmit a binary 1. Quad-
riphased phase shift keying (QPSK), takes two bits at a time to define one of four

13.3 Link Design 559

symbols. Each symbol corresponds to one of four carrier phases: 0 deg, 90 deg,
180 deg, or 270 deg. Note that the symbol rate is one half the bit rate, thus reducing
the spectrum width by one half.

Fig. 13-8. Modulation Types Commonly Used for Digital Signal Transmission in Satellite
Communications. F is the data rate. The shaded region is the required bandwidth.

Frequency shift keying (FSK) sets the carrier frequency at Fl to transmit a binary
O, and at F2 to transmit a binary 1. The separation between F1 and F2 must be at least
equal to the data rate to avoid performance loss from mutual interference. Thus, the
transmitted spectrum width is at least twice the width of the spectrum generated by
BPSK. Multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) sets the carrier frequency to one of M
frequencies. For example, for M = 8, the first three binary bits, 010, determine that the
transmitted frequency will be F5. The next three bits, 011, set the frequency at F6. The
symbol rate is one-third the bit rate, and the transmitted spectrum width is about 8/3
the bit rate, where the separation between frequencies is the symbol rate. Less common
spaceflight modulation schemes include minimum-shift-keying (MSK), offset-QPSK
(OQPSK), 8PSK [Sklar, 1988], and BPSK/PM [Yuen, 1983].

560 Communications Architecture 13.3

These modulation techniques have different spectrum widths, and thus require
different RF channel bandwidths, as illustrated in Fig. 13-8. An actual system may
require wider bandwidths as a result of a tradeoff between performance and filter com-
plexity. For example, the FLTSATCOM Experimental Package uses 8FSK as its mod-
ulation technique, with the tone frequency separation and total spectrum width twice
as large as that shown in the figure to make the filters less complex [McElroy, 1988].

To demodulate a digital bit reliably, the amount of energy received for that bit, Ey,
must exceed the noise spectral density, N,, by a specified amount. Communication
theory derives the E,/N, needed to achieve a required bit error rate, BER, at the
receiver output (see Sklar [1988], Chap. 3). The BER gives the probability of receiving
an erroneous bit. For example, a BER of 10-5 means that, on the average, only one bit
will be in error for every 105 bits received.

FSK- and MFSK-modulated signals are usually demodulated by measuring the
received power at each of the possible frequencies, and selecting the frequency with
the largest power as the one transmitted. An advantage of this technique is that any
variations in carrier phase introduced by the transmission channel (such as multipath)
will not greatly degrade the link performance. For this reason, these modulation types
are often used in military communications satellites (MFSK) and command links
(FSK modulation of a subcarrier).

On the other hand, demodulation of either BPSK and QPSK requires us to measure
the phase of the received carrier. Thus phase distortion caused by the transmission
channel will significantly degrade performance. The effect of this distortion can be
reduced using Differential PSK (DPSK). This technique requires no change in carrier
phase when transmitting a binary 0, and a 180-deg phase reversal when transmitting a
binary 1. At the receiver the phase of the carrier received during each bit period is
compared with the phase received during the previous bit period to determine whether
a phase change took place. This modulation technique overcomes distortion effects
provided the phase changes between successive bit periods are small (< 20 deg for
< 0.5 dB degradation).

Unfortunately, both BPSK and QPSK modulation experience sudden phase transi-
tions at the bit boundaries. These transitions generate sidebands outside the main
signal spectrum which may interfere with an adjacent frequency channel. But if the
carrier phase is gradually moved from one phase position to the next during the bit
period (from 0 deg to 180 deg, for example), then the sideband power is greatly
reduced. One version of this technique is Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) [Sklar, 1988,
Sec. 7.9.2]. These bandwidth efficient modulation techniques are particularly useful in
communications satellite systems with multiple channels closely spaced to fit the
available frequency spectrum.

A modulation method that combines binary phase shift keying of a subcarrier with
phase modulation of the carrier is BPSK/PM * modulation. Many TT&C links use this
modulation because the carrier and data are transmitted at frequencies separated by the
subcarrier frequency, which is made much larger than the data rate. This separation
allows easy acquisition and tracking of the carrier, thus providing an accurate range-
rate measurement. The disadvantages of this technique are additional power required
for the carrier and increased bandwidth (to approximately twice the subcarrier fre-
quency). For example, the SGLS TT&C downlink uses a 1.024 MHz subcarrier BPSK
modulated by data rates up to 128 kbps. The subcarrier then phase modulates the

carrier. For a phase modulation of +1.0 radian, the transmitter power is divided
between the carrier (60%) and subcarrier (40%). Figure 13-9 shows how the BER
varies with E,/N,.Table 13-11 lists the types of digital modulation commonly used in
space communication systems.

Fig. 13-9. Bit Error Probability as a Function of E,/N,.The theoretical performance limit
can be approached by use of error correction coding.

For the digital systems discussed in this chapter, the BER is used to evaluate the
performance of the link. On the other hand, analog communication links are generally
evaluated in terms of the output signal-to-noise ratio, S/N. The S/N is a function of the
C/N, the modulation type, and how the S/N is expressed. For example, the S/N of a
frequency modulated (FM) television signal depends on the modulation index and the
pre-emphasis plus weighting factors in addition to the C/N (see Morgan and Gordon
[1989], Sec. 3.4.5).

Forward error correction coding significantly reduces the E,/N, requirement,
which in turn reduces the required transmitter power and antenna size, or increases
link margin. Extra bits, called parity bits, are inserted into the data stream at the
transmitter. These bits enable the receiver to detect and correct for a limited number
of bit errors which might occur in transmission because of noise or interference. While
complex, these techniques can be implemented at relatively low cost, using large scale
integrated circuits with small size and low power consumption. This type of coding
does have some disadvantages. The extra error correction bits increase the bit rate, and
hence the transmission bandwidth, often a scarce resource. Also, a low E,,/N, makes
initial signal acquisition more difficult.

A common type of error correction technique is convolutional coding with Viterbi
decoding (Viterbi, 1967; Sklar, 1988]. A rate-1/2 convolutional code is implemented
by generating and transmitting two bits for each data bit. The data rate is therefore one-
half the transmitted bit rate (hence “rate-1/2’’). The receiver demodulates and stores in

memory a sequence (typically 62 bits long). As time goes on, additional bits are
received and stored. These sequences are compared with coded sequences which could
have been transmitted. The possible sequence which most closely resembles the
received sequence is chosen as the most likely sequence transmitted. This process is
repeated a number of times to reduce the probability of error. As shown in Fig. 13-9,
Viterbi decoding greatly reduces the E,/N, required to obtain a specified BER. For
example, a BER of 10-5 is achieved with an E,/No Of 4.4 dB. This represents an
improvement, or coding gain, of 5.2 dB below the 9.6 dB required for uncoded BPSK.

There is a value of E,/N, equal to —-1.6 dB, known as the Shannon limit, below
which no error-free communication at any information rate can take place. This is
derived from the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the maximum theoreti-
cal data rate, Rjg,, Which can be transmitted over a transmission channel with band-
width, B, is

Cc

where C/N is the average carrier-to-noise power ratio in the channel (see Panter
[1965], Sec. 19.2; or Sklar [1988], Sec. 7.4).

We cannot reach the Shannon limit in practice because the transmission bandwidth
and coding complexity increases without bound. But we can approach this limit by
using a double, or concatenated, coding scheme. The Pioneer deep-space communica-
tion link uses this technique to obtain the performance required to overcome the large
space loss [Yuen, 1983, Sec. 5.4.4]. The binary signal is first block encoded using a
255-bit Reed-Solomon code with 32 parity bits. The block-encoded signal is then
encoded using the rate-1/2 convolutional code. The data is recovered at the receiver
with a Viterbi decoder followed by a Reed-Solomon decoder. As shown in Fig. 13-9,
the BER performance for the concatenated code is only 4.2 dB above the Shannon
limit at a BER of 10-5. Longer and more complex codes can be used to push perfor-
mance even closer to the Shannon limit. This technique is not presently used for data
rates much above 100 bps due to the complexity and cost of the decoding process.
However, we expect this limitation to disappear in the future with the development of
high-speed, low-cost digital processing circuits.

Figure 13-9 demonstrates that the BER is sensitive to the E;/N, level. At error rates
below 10-4, a decrease of 1 dB in E»/N, Will increase the BER about one order of
magnitude. Thus, providing adequate link margin in our design (discussed later) is
very important. Note. that the E,/N, values given are theoretical, based on infinite
bandwidth transmission channels and ideal receivers. In practice, we must account for
band-limiting effects, deviations from ideal filter responses, phase noise and fre-
quency drift in local oscillators, noise in carrier tracking loops, and bit synchronizing
errors. Thus, we must add 1 or 2 dB to the theoretical E/N, to allow for these losses.

Choosing which modulation and coding technique to use depends on cost,
complexity, difficulty of acquiring the signal, limits on transmission bandwidth, and
susceptibility to interference or fading. In the case of power-limited systems, where
power is scarce but bandwidth is available, coding makes sense. Most systems today
use some forward error correction coding to save transmitter power unless the data rate
is greater than several hundred Mbps, in which case limits on both bandwidth and
hardware speed become significant.

Table 13-11 showed that to obtain a low value of E;,/N, for a BER of 10-5, we must
be less efficient in using the spectrum, which means the transmission bandwidth must
increase. This is the result of adding forward error correction check bits to the signal
before modulation, thus increasing the transmission rate through the channel. How-
ever, recent techniques can achieve significant coding gains without increasing the
bandwidth [Ungerboeck, 1982; Sklar, 1988, Sec. 7.10.6]. The basic idea is to combine
the coding and modulation process to generate a set of possible coded signal patterns
at RF, each pattern corresponding to an n-bit word. The receiver knows the set of pos-
sible patterns and chooses the pattern that most closely resembles what it receives. For
example, a four-state, rate-2/3, encoder combined with 8PSK modulation achieves a
3 dB coding gain over uncoded QPSK modulation with the same bandwidth. (8PSK is
like QPSK except the carrier phase is set at one of 8 possible phases separated by
45-deg intervals.) Such schemes have been proposed for high-speed data communica-
tion on satellite channels and are likely to be used in future space systems [Deng and
Costello, 1989].

13.3.4 Atmospheric and Rain Attenuation

The transmission path loss caused by the Earth’s atmosphere, L,, is a function of
frequency as shown in Fig. 13-10. This figure gives the attenuation at 90-deg eleva-
tion, that is, zenith. To determine the loss at elevation angles, 6, above 5 deg, divide
the zenith attenuation by sin 6. At frequencies below 1,000 MHz, ionospheric scintil-
lation can cause significant fluctuations in received amplitude and phase. These effects
are most severe at frequencies below 200 MHz during periods of high sunspot activity,
when they can disrupt communications (see Ippolito [1986], Chap. 8). Above 50 GHz,
high attenuation occurs at frequencies corresponding to the oxygen absorption band.
Virtually all Earth-space communications use frequencies between these two
extremes, though some projects have considered the 90-GHz band. Of special note is
the high absorption band of oxygen at 60 GHz. Intersatellite links often operate at
60 GHz, using the atmosphere to shield from interference or jamming originating on
the Earth’s surface.

Figure 13-11 shows that clouds and rain attenuation also add to losses, increasing
with frequency, in the transmission path. This figure comes from the Crane model—a
set of tables and equations based on observed climatic data used to estimate the rain
attenuation (see Crane [1980], or Ippolito [1986]). This attenuation becomes an
important consideration when designing systems employing satellite-Earth link
frequencies above 10 GHz. Figure 13-11 also shows that the attenuation increases
rapidly as the antenna elevation angle decreases below 20 deg. When operating at
frequencies above 20 GHz, the minimum elevation angle to the satellite should be
specified at 20 deg, especially in high rainfall areas. Note, however, that increasing the
minimum elevation angle dramatically reduces the size of the satellite’s coverage area
(see Secs. 5.3 and 5.4),

The percentage of time the link is available depends on the margin which the link
has in clear weather. A higher link availability demands a greater margin. The avail-
ability numbers shown in Fig. 13-11 correspond to the climate of northeastern United
States. The availability for a specified link margin will be higher in the Midwest and
lower in the Southeast, compared to those shown in the figure. (Bear in mind that these
availability numbers come from average weather conditions over many years; they do
not account for the possibility that this year the rainfall may be higher or lower than a
normal year.)

A by-product of rain attenuation is an increase in antenna temperature, 7, given by

T =(1-L)% (13-27)

where L, is the rain attenuation given as a power ratio, and 7, is the temperature of the
rain, usually assumed to be 290 K. The significance of this noise increase depends on
the system noise in clear weather. For example, if a receiving system with a normal
system temperature of 727 K experienced 10 dB rain attenuation, its noise temperature
would increase to 988 K, increasing N, by 1.3 dB. The decrease in C/N, would then
be the sum of the rain attenuation (-10 dB) and the increased noise (—1.3 dB) totaling
11.3 dB.

13.3.5 Frequency Selection

Regulatory constraints exist on the selection of frequency band, transmission band-
width, and power flux density. For example, international agreements have allocated
frequency bands for space communications, as listed in Table 13-12. These agree-
ments originated with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the

566 Communications Architecture 13.3

World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC). They are administered in the United
States by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for commercial users, and
by the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee for military users. The system
designer must apply for and receive permission from the appropriate agency to operate
at a specified frequency with the specified orbit and ground locations. This is often a
time-consuming procedure (see Chap. 21.1). For an excellent summary of this com-

plex subject, see Morgan and Gordon [1989].

A criterion for frequency band allocation is the potential for one link to interfere
with another. Extensive analysis is required when applying for a frequency band and
orbit to avoid interference with, or by, existing services such as terrestrial microwave
links and ground-based radar operations. Especially significant are the antenna side-
lobe levels and the dynamic range of powers over which the system must operate. For
ground-station antennas operating in the 4-6 GHz and 12-14 GHz bands, the FCC
specifies the maximum sidelobe gain as (32 — 25 log @) dBi for | deg < @< 48 deg;
otherwise —10 dBi for 48 deg < @ < 180 deg, where dBi is dB relative to an isotropic
radiator (0 dB gain) and @ is the angle in deg off the axis of the main antenna beam.
Also shown in Table 13-12 are the maximum allowed power flux densities radiated by
the satellite onto the Earth. These limitations, set by the ITU, are necessary to avoid
interference to existing terrestrial services, such as microwave relay links. __

Two geostationary satellites in approximately the same orbit location servicing the
same ground area may share the same frequency band by: (1) separating adjacent
satellites by an angle (typically 2 deg), which is larger than the ground station’s beam-
width, and (2) polarizing transmitting and receiving carriers orthogonally, which
allows two carriers to be received at the same frequency without significant mutual
interference. Right-hand and left-hand circular polarization are orthogonal, as are
horizontal and vertical linear polarization. Commercial systems use these frequency-
sharing techniques extensively [Morgan and Gordon, 1989].

13.3.6 Link Budgets

The link budget provides the designer with values of transmitter power and antenna
gains for the various links in the system. It is therefore one of the key items in a space
system design, revealing many characteristics of the overall system performance.

Table 13-13 presents link budgets for FireSat command and telemetry using the equa-

tions and figures given in this chapter.

Select carrier frequency, based on spectrum availability and FCC allocations.
(Refer to Table 13-6 for TT&C, Table 13-12 for communication satellites.)

. Select the satellite transmitter power, based on satellite size and power limits.

. Estimate RF losses between transmitter and satellite antennas. (Usually

between —1 and —3 dB.)

. Determine the required beamwidth for the satellite antenna, depending on the

satellite orbit, satellite stabilization, and ground coverage area (see Chap. 7).

. Estimate the maximum antenna pointing offset angle, based on coverage

angle, satellite stabilization error, and stationkeeping accuracy.

. Calculate transmit antenna gain toward the ground station, using Eqs. (13-20)

and (13-21). You might also want to check the antenna diameter, using
Eq. (13-19), to see if it will fit on the satellite.

. Calculate space loss, using Eq. (13-23a). This is determined by satellite orbit

and ground-station location.

. Estimate propagation absorption loss due to the atmosphere using Fig. 13-10,

dividing the zenith attenuation by the sine of the minimum elevation angle
(e.g. 10 deg) from the ground station to the satellite. (Consider rain attenua-
tion later.) I would also add a loss of 0.3 dB to account for polarization
mismatch for large ground antennas. Using a radome adds another 1 dB loss.

. Select the ground station antenna diameter and estimate pointing error. If

autotracking is used, let the pointing error be 10% of the beamwidth. Use
Eq. (13-21) to calculate the antenna beamwidth.

Calculate the receive antenna gain toward the satellite. For FireSat we used
antenna efficiency, 7, of 0.55.

Estimate the system noise temperature (in clear weather), using Table 13-10.

Calculate E,/N, for the required data rate, using Eq. (13-14).

Using Fig. 13-9, look up E,/N, required to achieve desired BER for the
selected modulation and coding technique. The downlink for FireSat is modu-
lated with BPSK and the uplink is BPSK/PM. See Table 13-11.

Add 1 to 2 dB to the theoretical value given in Fig. 13-9 for implementation
losses.

Calculate the link margin—the difference between the expected value of
E,/N, calculated and the required E,,/N, (including implementation loss).

Estimate the degradation due to rain, using Fig. 13-11 and Eq. (13-27).

Adjust input parameters until the margin is at least 3 dB greater than the esti-
mated value for rain degradation, depending on confidence in the parameter
estimates.

For communications satellites to evaluate a complete communication link (ground-
to-ground), you must do the downlink shown above, and also calculate the uplink, and
combine their E,/N,s in order to evaluate the communication link.

13.3 Link Design 569

The downlink calculation described above provides the signal-to-noise at the
ground station based on the assumed parameters for the downlink. In order to establish
the performance of a communication link Earth-to-Earth, it is necessary to do the same
calculation on the uplink from the ground station to the satellite. The overall link per-
formance can then be predicted based on the design of the satellite communication
payload. In a bent-pipe satellite, the signal-to-noise ratio established on the uplink is
used as the “signal” input for the downlink, and a final signal-to-noise is calculated
based on the noise already on the signal plus the noise gained on the downlink. For a
signal processing payload (see Sec. 13.5.2), where signals are demodulated and re-
modulated on board the satellite, then the overall signal-to-noise performance is only
that of the downlink, because this is a “pure” signal generated on the satellite. Many
of the new data satellites, and some of the cellular telephone satellites, use onboard
processing.

When digital links are evaluated in terms of their bit error rate, the system for signal
processing satellites gets more complicated, because there will be a certain bit error
rate on the uplink which becomes the starting point for the downlink. The bit error rate
will never be better than the weakest link. For these systems, it is desirable to make the
uplink very robust so that bit error rates of 10-9 or 10-10 are achieved on the uplink,
in order that, again, the downlink determines the overall performance. This is typical
for most satellite links, as the satellite is limited in the amount of transmit power,
whereas ground stations are relatively independent of that limitation, at least until
frequencies of 30 GHz and above are used, in which case the cost of the transmitters
becomes a limiting factor. Transmit power, transmit antenna gain, receiver noise
figure, and receive antenna gain establish the maximum signal- -to-noise that can be
established on any link.

Many of the data handling satellites discussed elsewhere in this chapter expect to
deliver 10-10 bit error rates on the entire Earth-Earth link. This is being achieved by
using very powerful forward-error-correcting codes (see Sec. 13.3.3). Convolutional
coding and Viterbi decoding (rate 1/3, K = 7) allow 10-!° bit error rates with E/N,
of only 5 dB for many newer, commercial data satellites.

The question often asked is, “How much margin is enough?” Clearly, too much
margin is wasteful and costly, but not enough margin could occasionally lead to
excessive bit error rates. Intelsat carries a 4 to 5 dB margin for their C-Band links. At
frequencies above 10 GHz the margin should be 6 to 20 dB to accommodate atmo-
spheric and rain losses, the exact amount depending on the required link availability
and the amount of rainfall expected.

The order of the steps outlined above will depend on which parameters are
specified. For example, one might start with link margin and solve for transmitter
power. The uplink design is performed in the same way, except the receive antenna
beamwidth may depend on the Earth-coverage requirement rather than size or pointing
limitations.

Figure 13-12 illustrates how the downlink design, using a geostationary satellite,
can vary with choice of carrier frequency. In this example, the satellite antenna’s
beamwidth is fixed at 6 deg to illuminate a specified Earth coverage area, and the
ground-station size is fixed at 0.5 m for ease of transport. As the frequency decreases,
the satellite antenna’s diameter increases to maintain the specified beamwidth (and
gain) until it reaches a maximum size (or mass) limit, which, in this example, is 2 m
at 1.75 GHz. Reducing the frequency further requires more transmitter power to
compensate for the loss in antenna gain [see Eq. (13-18a)]. On the other hand, going

570 Communications Architecture 13.4

to higher frequencies requires more transmitter power to compensate for increasing
receive antenna pointing loss and to provide a margin to operate through rain. The
figure shows the preferred frequency is between 1 and 18 GHz.

Table 13-13 shows we can satisfy the FireSat mission with a 20-W transmitter
operating at S-Band (2.2 GHz) with a broad-beam antenna covering the entire Earth.
A higher-gain antenna requires continuous steering to point toward the ground station,
making the satellite far more complex. The diameter of the ground station antenna is
5.3 m.

13.4 Sizing the Communications Payload

We now have determined the satellite transmitter power and antenna aperture size
required to support our links. These parameters have the greatest impact on satellite
mass, and thus on the cost of the system. In this section we will describe these
components and estimate their mass. This process is summarized in Table 13-9 in
Sec. 13.3.

Up to now we have considered only the parabolic reflector antenna, which is best
suited for applications where the peak gain is above 20 dB and beamwidth is less than
15 deg. For lower-gain, wider-beam applications, we may prefer other types of
antennas with lighter mass and simpler design, especially at frequencies below 1 GHz
(see Table 13-14). For example, an Earth-coverage satellite antenna has a beamwidth
just big enough to illuminate the Earth. At geosynchronous altitude, this beamwidth is

18 deg. A simple horn antenna is often used at frequencies of 4 GHz or above (such as
the Intelsat V C-Band TT&C antenna). When the frequency is below about 2 GHz, the
helix often has lighter mass and is easier to mount on a satellite structure. Either a

572 Communications Architecture 13.4

single helix (FLTSATCOM UHF transmit), or quad-helix (Intelsat V L-Band) may be
used. Table 13-14 compares these choices for an Earth-coverage antenna at
400 MHz. Wider satellite antenna beamwidths are required during launch and insertion
into orbit because satellite maneuvers cause large variations in angle toward the
ground station. During transfer orbit the satellite is often spin-stabilized, thus requiring
a toroidal beam (omnidirectional in the plane perpendicular to the satellite spin axis)
to provide continuous coverage. Figure 13-13 shows a typical antenna pattern. A
biconical horn can generate this beam if it is mounted on a mast to avoid reflections
from the satellite’s body. The antenna gain is typically at least -3 dB +35 deg from the
spin axis. Once in orbit the satellite is stabilized toward Earth. A directional antenna,
usually a simple conical horn, provides a gain of 9 dB or more over +20 deg from the
Earth vertical. As an example, the Intelsat V satellite combines the toroidal and
directional (Earth-coverage) beams at a single port connected to the command re-
ceiver. The telemetry transmitters switch to either beam, depending on the mission
phase.

High-gain antennas are required to support high data rates with low transmitter
power. The basic antenna types used for this application, summarized in Table 13-15,
are the reflector, lens, and phased array. The reflector is most desirable for satellites
because of its low mass, low complexity and cost, and design maturity. The weight
advantage of a reflector over a lens or phased array is especially significant for larger
antenna diameters (> 0.5 m). Offset feeds can also simplify the satellite structure. The
satellite structure contains the feed which is pointed at the reflector (Intelsat V, for
example). Furthermore, an offset feed minimizes aperture blockage and therefore
reduces the sidelobe levels.

In some missions it is necessary to change the direction the antenna beam is
pointing. Steering the beam electronically is often preferred to mechanical methods,
especially if the beam direction must be changed rapidly. The beam of a reflector
antenna can be steered by switching to an off-axis feed. However, conventional reflec-
tor antennas have high losses when scanned off axis. A shaped secondary reflector can
compensate for these losses, but scan angles greater than about 10 deg are difficult to
achieve. We can design lens antennas for good scanning performance, but their mass
is generally larger than the reflector plus feed when the diameter exceeds about 0.5 m.
The lens or reflector antenna can perform beam scanning by switching between
multiple feed elements or by using a phased array as the feed. Switching between feed
elements or varying the amplitude or phase of each element electronically controls the
feed. However, losses caused by the feed control (beam forming) network [Z, in
Eq. (13-4)] can degrade the scanning antenna’s performance.

A phased-array antenna may generate one or more beams simultaneously, forming
these beams by varying the phase or amplitude of each radiating element of the array.
This technique used for microwave radiometry is described in Chap. 9. We may also
use an adaptive array to automatically point a null toward a jamming signal source to
reduce the jamming-to-signal ratio.

To support high data rates with low satellite power, the antenna beamwidth should
be narrow. However, as illustrated in Fig. 13-14, a narrow beam may not give us
enough coverage to establish links between several widely separated ground stations.
The DSCS III solved this problem by using waveguide lens antennas with variable
beam-forming networks to generate a single beam with multiple lobes, each directed
toward a ground station. An alternate approach is to generate multiple beams. Milstar
uses a lens with a switched-feed array, and ACTS uses a reflector with an offset

switched-feed array. These antennas generate either simultaneous multiple beams or a
single beam which is scanned or hopped over the Earth’s surface using time multiplex-
ing between channels (see Sec. 13.5). Thus high antenna gain and broad area coverage
are achieved at the same time. Another advantage of the beamhopping technique is
that the satellite coverage can be readily matched to the geographic traffic distribution
by making the beam dwell time proportional to the traffic level.

LEO satellites such as Iridium and Globalstar form multiple beams using phased
arrays covering the visible Earth. The multiple beams provide for spectrum conserva-
tion by frequency reuse. Iridium forms 64 beams which scan to continuously point to
a point on the Earth as the satellite passes over that point. Globalstar has fixed beams
which “sweep” over a point on the ground as the satellite passes over.

The mass of a satellite antenna, including feed, depends largely on its size and the
materials used in its construction. These factors are in turn a function of the frequency
and beamwidth or gain. Table 13-16 lists some examples of satellite antenna weights,
showing that the more complex shaped-beam antennas have relatively high mass
because of their complex feed networks. Multiple and scanning beam antennas have
comparable masses.

The power efficiency and mass of a satellite transmitter are often key factors in
sizing a satellite. Figure 13-15 shows how the transmitter input power and mass varies
with output RF power, based on actual satellite equipment. We can see that the solid-

13.5 Special Topics 575

state transmitter has lower mass but requires more input power compared to the
traveling wave tube amplifier. In general, solid-state transmitters are preferred for
power outputs up to 5 or 10 W, except at frequencies below 2 GHz, where power
outputs up to 80 W are achievable. Solid-state amplifiers are more reliable than the
traveling wave tube amplifier, mostly because they require lower voltages. We expect
improved solid-state amplifiers with higher powers and frequencies will become
available during the next 10 years.

13.5 Special Topics

This section discusses several special topics in selecting communications archi-
tectures.

13.5.1 Multiple Access: Sharing Communication Links

Some missions may require more than one uplink or downlink, especially where
relay satellites have a number of satellites and ground stations interconnected in a sin-

gle network. In such situations, it is cost effective to provide a means of sharing a lim-
ited amount of satellite link capacity between users.

Figure 13-16 shows three basic techniques for sharing link capacity. Frequency
division multiple access (FDMA) assigns a single carrier frequency for each input sig-
nal. Bandpass filters at the receiver separate the individual carriers from each other.
Most communications satellite systems use this technique with a repeater transponder
operating in a linear (back-off) mode. The ground station is less expensive because the
transmitter peak power is lower than the TDMA ground station described below.

Time division multiple access (TDMA) assigns a single time slot in each time frame
to a single input channel. A digitized input signal is sampled and stored in buffer mem-
ory. These samples are then transmitted as short bursts within the assigned time slots.
The bit rate during the burst is high, therefore requiring a high peak transmitter power.
At the receiver the samples are sorted and stored, and then read out at the original rate.
These samples are then converted to an analog signal and smoothed to obtain a replica
of the original input signal. Some systems, including Intelsat and DSCS-III, use this
method for some of their users.

If the satellite uses a multiple-beam antenna, a switching matrix on the satellite may
be used with TDMA to route each time slot burst to the desired downlink antenna
beam. The NASA ACTS [Naderi and Kelly, 1988] uses this technique, known as Sat-
ellite Switched-TDMA (SS-TDMA). In some applications, the uplink uses the FODMA
technique, and the downlink uses the TDMA [McElroy, 1988]. This method requires
onboard processing (demodulation and remodulation) of the signal in the satellite, as
discussed below.

A third technique, code division multiple access (CDMA), consists of phase-
modulating (BPSK or QPSK) a carrier with data, and then biphase-modulating the
carrier with a pseudorandom noise (PN) code. (See Fig. 13-17.) The data rate is much
lower than the PN code, or chip rate. Thus there are many code bits (or chips) per data
bit. The receiver has a code generator which replicates the PN code of the desired
signal on a carrier with frequency equal to the received carrier plus or minus an inter-
mediate frequency (IF).

The PN codes are designed to have low cross-correlation properties (shown in
Fig. 13-17B) so that two or more signals can be transmitted simultaneously at the same
frequency with little mutual interference. Thus the received signals are essentially
uncorrelated with the locally generated PN code and appear as noise to the receiver,
except when identical received and locally-generated codes are aligned, or synchro-
nized, in time. When this happens, the output of the mixer is a carrier containing only
the narrow-band data modulation, which passes through the IF bandpass filter (BPF)

(Fig. 13-17D). The PN code modulation is completely removed, leaving the desired
user signal “despread.” At the same time, the signals from the undesired users appear
at the output of the mixer as PN-coded signals with a spectrum width roughly twice
the PN-code rate. Therefore, only a small portion of the undesired signal will pass
through the narrow-band output BPF.

13.5 Special Topics 579

As shown in Fig. 13-17B, the power density of the PN-coded signal at center
frequency is proportional to 1/R, (R, = I/t)), where R, is the chip rate. The spectrum
of the desired signal after despreading is proportional to 1/R, where R is the data rate.
Thus the power density of the desired signal is increased, relative to the power density
of an unspread interfering signal, by the ratio R, /R. This ratio is commonly referred
to as the coding gain of the spread-spectrum system.

Note that in order to receive the desired signal, the locally generated code must be
identical to the desired signal’s code, and the two codes must be synchronized. We
may accomplish this synchronization by scanning the locally generated code in time
until synchronization takes place. To reduce the time to synchronize, a short code may
be used for acquisition, such as the C/A signal in GPS.

The number of simultaneous users which the CDMA system can handle is limited
by the noise generated by the undesired user signals. Suppose all CDMA user code
rates and data rates are the same, and their carrier powers at the receiver input are
equal. How many users can the system support? Eq. (13-28) estimates the maximum
number of users, M, that the system can accommodate before the received energy-per-
bit, E,/N,, drops below threshold.

where C/N, is the received carrier-to-noise-density ratio from one user (Eq. 13-15a),
R, is the PN-code chip rate, R is the data rate, and R, is much greater than R. Note that
in Eq. (13-28) C/N, and E;,/N, are power ratios, not dB.

An example of a CDMA system is the GPS navigation message on the C/A signal.
Each satellite transmits a PN code with a different time phase. R, = 1.023 Mbps,
R= 50 bps, E,/N,= 10 dB = 10, and C/N, = 38.6 dB-Hz = 7,244 Hz. Substituting into
Eq. (13-28), we obtain M = 1,906 channels. This, of course, is much greater than the
actual number of channels required for GPS (less than 28).

Remember that M is the number of equal-power users. Suppose one user is received
with power 10 times greater than the other M-1 users. If this is an undesired user, it
will generate interference equivalent to 10 undesired equal-powered users, thus reduc-
ing M by 9. For this reason an efficient CDMA system often requires some automatic
means of controlling the transmitter power of each user.

The CDMA system is generally less bandwidth-efficient than FODMA or TDMA.
On the other hand, the CDMA system is less susceptible to interference, including
multipath caused by reflections from buildings or other objects. This makes CDMA of
special interest to satellite communication systems with mobile terminals. For more
information on multiple access techniques, see Morgan and Gordon [1989], Chap. 4.

Code division multiple access, CDMA, is used by the Globalstar cellular telephone
satellite system in order to preserve spectrum. Each signal is 1.23 MHz wide, corre-
sponding to the Cellular Telephone Industries Association Standard IS-95 for terres-
trial cellular telephones. Up to 128 different signals can be “stacked” on the same
frequency channel by virtue of being biphase modulated by different pseudorandom
noise codes, or Walsh codes, as discussed above. The receiver recovers the signal by
applying the same code to the incoming signal, demodulating it. If you divided this
band by 64 kHz, the bandwidth of a typical digital telephone signal, you get only 19
signals in the same bandwidth. In practice, the number of signals on a given channel
is limited to 30 to 50 because of satellite transmit power limitations.

13.5.2 Payloads with Onboard Processing

As discussed previously, communication relay satellites usually employ a repeater
transponder (also called a non-regenerative repeater or “bent pipe”), which receives
the uplink signals from all of the user transmitters operating in the assigned uplink
frequency band, shifts the frequency to the downlink band, amplifies, and retransmits.
This transponder is reliable and simple to use. But this technique has several disadvan-
tages when more than one signal is received at the same time. First, the transponder’s
transmitter must operate as a linear amplifier to reduce mutual interference caused by
intermodulation distortion. We must back off the input signals about 3 to 6 dB from
maximum, thus reducing the transmitter’s power output to roughly one-half to one-
fourth of the maximum saturated power. We do so by controlling the transponder gain
in the satellite (either automatically or by ground command), or by regulating each
ground station’s transmitter power. Second, the strongest uplink signal will tend to
capture the satellite transmitter power, thus suppressing the weaker signals. This
makes the transponder particularly vulnerable to uplink jamming.

An alternative to the repeater transponder is the onboard processing transponder
or regenerative transponder. This transponder demodulates the received signal on
board the satellite, and then routes the signal to the appropriate downlink modula-
tor/transmitter and antenna beam (see Fig. 13-18). An example of this architecture is
the Fleetsat Experimental Package developed for the Air Force by Lincoln Laboratory
(McElroy, 1988]. The FDMA technique is selected for the uplink to allow use of low-
power, ground-station transmitters as discussed above. The FDMA signals are
demodulated by the satellite transponder, and the messages are reformatted into a
single downlink TDMA data stream. TDMA is selected over FDMA for the downlink
to allow the satellite transmitter to operate at saturation for high power efficiency.
While more complex, the processing transponder overcomes the disadvantages of the
repeater transponder.

A large number of 20/30 GHz synchronous (except for Teledesic) satellites were
proposed to the FCC in August 1995. None has been licensed yet. They are listed in
Table 13-18. Most of these satellites plan to use advanced onboard signal processing
transponders. This allows onboard rerouting of the data, and improvement of the over-

all link performance because the noise of the uplink is not carried over to the downlink.
Many of these proposals promised digital data transmission of the order of 10-19 bit
error rate with E,/N,s on each link of the order of 5 dB. They used coding scheme such
as those discussed in Table 13-11 and the accompanying text in Sec. 13.3.3.

13.5.3 Antijam Techniques

Because the satellite is usually in view of a large segment of Earth, RF interference
from Earth-based transmitters, either unintentional or deliberate, may occur. The
frequency allocation procedures discussed previously minimize unintentional inter-
ference. Intentional interference, or jamming, is of particular concern in military
applications. Jamming consists of transmitting a large modulated carrier to the receive
terminal at approximately the same frequency, overwhelming the desired signal and
thus disabling the link.

We can reduce the effects of jamming by using spread-spectrum modulation
techniques [Dixon, 1984] to spread the transmitted signal in a pseudorandom manner
over a bandwidth much larger than the data rate. The receiver takes advantage of the
fact that he knows the code used to modulate the transmission while the jammer does
not. A replica of the pseudorandom waveform is generated at the receiver and corre-
lated with the received signal to extract the data modulation. Using this method, we
can reduce the received jamming power relative to the desired signal by the ratio of
the spread-spectrum bandwidth to the unspread signal bandwidth. For example, by
hopping a BPSK-modulated signal of 100 bps over 1 MHz, the jamming power, on the
average, is reduced by a factor of approximately 10,000, or 40 dB.

In a communication relay satellite, onboard processing is highly desirable to
despread the received signal before retransmitting it on the downlink. Otherwise the
uplink jamming signal will capture most of the satellite transmitter’s power, leaving
little for the signal. Another technique for countering uplink jamming, employed by
the DSCS-III, is to generate a null in the antenna beam pointed toward the jamming
source. This technique can lower the jamming power by 20 to 40 dB relative to the
power of the received signal.

The satellite crosslink may also be jammed. The satellite can reject jammers located
on Earth by using narrow antenna beams pointed away from the Earth. Operating at
60 GHz takes advantage of the oxygen absorption band, thus shielding the satellite
from the Earth. Crosslinks may also use spread-spectrum and antenna-nulling
techniques.

582 Communications Architecture 13.5

13.5.4 Security

A characteristic of space-ground communication is the ease with which the link can
be intercepted by an unauthorized user, who may receive the data for his own use, or,
even worse, take control of the satellite by transmitting commands to it. Data encryp-
tion techniques help us avoid these problems by denying access to the data and the
satellite command channel unless the user has the correct encryption key. Recent
developments have led to complete encryption and decryption devices being placed on
single VLSI chips, thus adding little to satellite mass. The main issues are distributing
the key and synchronizing time. To make sure a link remains secure over the life of
the satellite, the encryption key must change at regular intervals, because others will
monitor and eventually uncover it.

The receiver decryption device must be accurately synchronized with the transmit-
ter encryption device to recover the original data. With some systems, both the satellite
and ground station may need a very accurate atomic clock, especially if the data rate
is high and one must acquire the signal within seconds. For command links to station-
ary satellites, the data rate is low and the acquisition time can be long. For this
application, crystal oscillators are accurate enough. An alternative to atomic clocks is
a GPS receiver, which automatically synchronizes itself to the GPS time standard.

13.5.5 Diversity Techniques

Diversity techniques consist of transmitting or receiving the same signal more than
once to increase the probability of receiving the signal correctly. For example, a satel-
lite may transmit a signal simultaneously to two ground stations. If the distance
between these ground stations is greater than about 5 km, the probability of high rain-
fall attenuation existing at both locations at the same time is small. This technique is
called spatial diversity and is an effective way to increase the availability of a satellite-
ground station link operating at frequencies above 20 GHz, where rain attenuation can
be large [Ippolito, 1986].

A second example of diversity is to transmit the same signal two or more times at
different frequencies or time intervals. For example, multipath fading may be caused
by reflections of the signal from parts of the aircraft structure in a satellite-to-aircraft
link. The multiple reflected signals will interfere with the main signal, causing the
amplitude of the received signal to vary with frequency and time as the aircraft moves.
Use of frequency or time diversity will increase the probability that the message will
be received correctly in at least one frequency or time interval. In military applications,
frequency hopping over one data symbol provides frequency diversity protection
against partial band jamming. Forward error correction coding followed by inter-
leaving (e.g., scrambling the order in which the bits are transmitted) provides a form
of time diversity protection against a pulse jammer. Time interleaving improves the
decoding performance by randomizing a burst of errors caused by pulse jamming.

’ A third example of diversity is a technique used by Globalstar, “satellite diversity.”
In this case a ground station talks to a UT with circuits through two separate satellites.
This is not to avoid rain outages as discussed above, but rather outages caused by
blockage from buildings or trees for mobile UTs. If the path to one satellite is tempo-
rarily interrupted, the power is increased on the other link to maintain the contact.
Also, when one satellite is “setting,” this technique maintains the conversation through
the “other” satellite while a new “rising” satellite can begin to carry a circuit. In this
way, handover between satellites is transparent. This is accomplished by using a
RAKE receiver. A RAKE receiver has the property of having several parallel digital

13.5 Special Topics 583

processing channels which can correct for Doppler frequency offset and time delay so
as to combine several digital signals in time alignment for the maximum signal-to-
noise ratio. The technique requires two ground antennas, which are putting many
circuits through each satellite simultaneously.

13.5.6 Optical Links

In recent years lasers generating narrow band energy at optical frequencies provide
an attractive alternative to the microwave frequencies discussed above. Unfortunately,
clouds and rain seriously attenuate optical links. Therefore, optical links have limited
application in satellite-Earth communications. However, an optical link is well suited
for communication between two satellites. Intersatellite links have been designed
using optical links with capacities above 300 Mbps.

Optical crosslinks are superior to microwave crosslinks for high data rates because
they can obtain extremely narrow beamwidths and high gains with reasonable size (see
Fig. 13-19). Also, frequency allocation problems do not exist in the infrared or visual
bands. On the other hand, the narrow optical beams are difficult to acquire and point
accurately, requiring complex and sometimes heavy pointing mechanisms.

Figure 13-20 compares RF and laser crosslinks, demonstrating that RF links are
generally better for data rates less than about 100 Mbps because of their lower mass
and power. However, development of more efficient lasers and lighter steerable optics
may soon make lower rate optical links attractive.

One application of optical links between satellites and Earth is the blue-green laser
link being developed by DARPA and the U.S. Navy for submarine communications
(Weiner, 1980]. The laser frequency of 6 x 10!4 Hz was chosen for its ability to pen-
etrate sea water. Even so, the water loss can range from 5 to 50 dB or more, depending
upon the actual depth of the submarine. In addition, loss due to cloud scattering is

between 4 to 14 dB. These losses are overcome by using low data rates of 10 to 100
bps, advanced coding techniques, and high-gain, narrow-beam optics.

Commercial satellites for both 2 GHz mobile satellite service and 38/49 GHz
trunking service have proposed use of optical intersatellite links between satellites for
efficient data transmission. They promise the advantages cited above in Figs. 13-19
and 13-20. A listing of these proposals is in Table 13-19.
