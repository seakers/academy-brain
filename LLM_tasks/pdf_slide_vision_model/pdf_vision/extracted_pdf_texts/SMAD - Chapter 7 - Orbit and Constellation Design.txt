Chapters 5 and 6 introduced the geometry and physics of spacecraft orbits, as well
as formulas for computing orbit parameters. In contrast, this chapter deals with select-
ing or designing orbits to meet the largest number of mission requirements at the least
possible cost. The orbit selection process is complex, involving trades between a
number of different parameters. The orbit typically defines the space mission lifetime,
cost, environment, viewing geometry, and, frequently, the payload performance. Most
commonly, we must trade the velocity required to achieve the orbit as a measure of
cost vs. coverage performance.

Chapter 6 lists several references on astrodynamics. Unfortunately, very few of
these references contain any discussion of the orbit selection or design process.
Chobotov [1996] and Vallado [1997] have some information. By far the most exten-
sive discussion of this topic is in Wertz [2001]. Soop [1994] contains an excellent
discussion of the design of geostationary orbits.

Ordinarily, spacecraft will be in various orbits during the space mission life. These
could include, for example, a parking orbit for spacecraft checkout or storage, a
transfer orbit to move it from the injection orbit where the spacecraft separated from
the launch vehicle to its operational orbit or orbits for mission activities, and possibly
a final disposal orbit where the spacecraft will do minimum damage when we are
through using it. In early mission design, we pay most attention to defining the space-
craft’s operational orbit. However, preliminary mission design needs to consider all
mission phases to meet the needs of more complex missions.

7.1 The Orbit Design Process

Orbit design has no absolute rules; the method described below and summarized in
Table 7-1 gives a starting point and checklist for the process.

Effective orbit design requires clearly identifying the reasons for orbit selection,
reviewing these reasons regularly as mission requirements change or mission defini-
tion improves, and continuing to remain open to alternatives. Several different designs
may be credible. Thus, communications may work effectively through a single large
satellite in geosynchronous orbit or a constellation of small satellites in low-Earth
orbit. We may need to keep both options for some time before selecting one.

Step 1. Establish Orbit Types

To design orbits we first divide the space mission into segments and classify each
segment by its overall function. Each orbit segment has different selection criteria, so
we evaluate it separately, placing it into one of the four basic types:

¢ Parking Orbit—a temporary orbit which provides a safe and convenient
location for satellite checkout, storage between operations, or at end-of-life.
Also used to match conditions between phases such as post-launch and pre-
orbit transfer.

¢ Transfer Orbit—ased for getting from place to place. Examples: transfer orbit
to geosynchronous altitude; interplanetary orbit to Mars.

* Space-referenced Orbit—an operational orbit whose principal characteristic is
being somewhere in space (specific orbit parameters may not be critical).
Examples: Lagrange point orbits for space sampling and observations; orbits
for celestial observations or space manufacturing.

¢ Earth-referenced Orbit—an operational orbit which provides the necessary
coverage of the surface of the Earth or near-Earth space. Examples: geosyn-
chronous satellites, low-Earth satellites for Earth resources, meteorology, or
communications.

71 The Orbit Design Process 161

A Shuttle-launched communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit provides an
example of dividing a mission into segments. Once ejected from the Shuttle, the space-
craft may briefly stay in a parking orbit near the Shuttle to provide test and checkout
of spacecraft and transfer vehicle systems. The second mission segment uses a transfer
orbit to move the spacecraft from its parking orbit to geosynchronous equatorial orbit.
The spacecraft then enters its operational orbit in the geostationary ring where it will
spend the rest of its active life. At the end of its life we must move it out of the geosta-
tionary ring to avoid a possible collision with other satellites and to free the orbital slot
for a replacement. (See Sec. 21.2.) Putting the nearly dead spacecraft into a final
disposal orbit above the geostationary ring requires a relatively small transfer orbit.
(Going above the geostationary ring rather than below avoids collisions with other
satellites in geosynchronovs transfer.)

Step 2. Establish Orbit-Related Mission Requirements

For each mission segment, we define the orbit-related requirements. They may
include orbital limits, individual requirements such as the altitude needed for specific
observations, or a range of values constraining any of the orbit parameters. Section 7.4
discusses in detail the requirements we would follow in designing an operational orbit.
Ordinarily, these multiple requirements drive the orbit in different directions. For
example, resolution or required aperture tend to drive the orbit to low altitudes, but
coverage, lifetime, and survivability drive the spacecraft to higher altitudes.

Selecting of parking, transfer, and space-referenced orbits is normally conceptually
simpler, although it may be mathematically complex. Here the normal trade is meeting
the desired constraints on a mission, such as lifetime, thermal, or radiation environ-
ments, at the lowest possible propellant cost. Section 7.5 discusses the key mission
requirements for these orbits.

Step 3. Assess Specialized Orbits

In selecting the orbit for any mission phase, we must first determine if a specialized
orbit applies. Specialized orbits are those with unique characteristics, such as the
geostationary ring in which satellites can remain nearly stationary over a given point
on the Earth’s equator. We examine each specialized orbit to see if its unique charac-
teristics are worth its cost. This examination precedes the more detailed design trades,
because specialized orbits constrain parameters such as altitude or inclination, and
thus often lead to very different solutions for a given mission problem. Consequently,
we may need to carry more than one orbit into more detailed design trades.

Step 4. Choose Single Satellite or Constellation

The principal advantage of a single satellite is that it reduces cost by minimizing
the mission overhead. Thus, one satellite will have one power system, one attitude
control system, one telemetry system, and require only a single launch vehicle. A
constellation, on the other hand, may provide better coverage, higher reliability if a
satellite is lost, and more survivability. We may also need a constellation to provide
the multiple conditions to carry out the mission, such as varying lighting conditions
for observations, varying geometries for navigation, or continuous coverage of part or
all of the Earth for a communications constellation.

To meet budget limits, we must often trade a single large satellite with larger and
more complex instruments against a constellation of smaller, simpler satellites. This

162 Orbit and Constellation Design 71

decision may depend on the technology available at the time of satellite design. As
small satellites become more capable through miniaturized electronics (Chap. 22) and
onboard processing (Chap. 16), we may be able to construct constellations of small,
low-cost satellites, frequently called LightSats, that were not previously economically
feasible. Another major cost element for large constellations is the operational
problem of providing continuous navigation and control. The introduction of low-cost
autonomous navigation and control (See Sec. 11.7) should promote larger constella-
tions of small satellites in the future.

Step 5. Do Mission Orbit Design Trades

The next step is to select the mission orbit by evaluating how orbit parameters affect
each of the mission requirements from Table 7-6 in Sec. 7.4. As the table shows, orbit
design depends principally on altitude. The easiest way to begin is by assuming a
circular orbit and then conducting altitude and inclination trades. (See Sec. 7.4 and the
example in Sec. 3.3.1.) This process establishes a range of potential altitudes and
inclinations, from which we can select one or more alternatives. Documenting the
results of this key trade is particularly important, so we can revisit the trade from time
to time as mission requirements and conditions change. If a satellite constellation is
one of the alternatives, then phasing the satellites within that constellation is a key
characteristic, as Sec. 7.6 describes.

Note that constellations of satellites are normally at a common altitude and inclin-
ation because the orbit’s drift characteristics depend largely on these parameters.
Satellites at different altitudes or inclinations will drift apart so that their relative
orientation will change with time. Thus, satellites at different altitudes or inclinations
normally do not work well together as a constellation for extended times.

Step 6. Assess Launch and Retrieval or Disposal Options

Chapter 18 discusses satellite launch systems in detail. The launch vehicle contrib-
utes strongly to mission costs, and ultimately will limit the amount of mass that can be
placed in an orbit of any given altitude. As we define the mission early on, we must
provide enough launch margin to allow for later changes in launch vehicles or
spacecraft weight. Naturally, new designs require more margin than existing ones,
with 20% being typical for new missions.

Although given little consideration in the past, retrieval and disposal of spacecraft
have become important to mission design (Sec. 21.2). Spacecraft that will reenter the
atmosphere must either do controlled reentry, burn up in the atmosphere, or break up
into harmless pieces.

If the spacecraft will not reenter the atmosphere in a reasonable time, we must stil]
dispose of it at the end of its useful life so it is not hazardous to other spacecraft. This
problem is particularly acute in geosynchronous orbit where missions compete
strongly for orbit slots.* As Sec. 21.2 points out, a collision between two spacecraft
not only destroys them but also causes debris dangerous to their entire orbit regime.

A third option is satellite retrieval, done either to refurbish and reuse the satellite,
or to recover material (such as radioactive products) which would be dangerous if they
entered the atmosphere uncontrolled. Currently, the Shuttle can retrieve spacecraft

* Cefola [1987] gives an excellent analysis of the requirements for removing satellites from
geosynchronous orbit.

7.2 Earth Coverage 163

only from low-Earth orbit. In the future, it would be desirable to retrieve satellites as
far away as geosynchronous orbit and return them to either the Orbiter or Space
Station for refurbishment, repair, disposal, or reuse.

Step 7. Evaluate Constellation Growth and Replenishment

An important characteristic of any satellite constellation is growth, replenishment,
and graceful degradation. A constellation that becomes operational only after many
satellites are in place causes many economic, planning, and checkout problems.
Constellations should be at least partly serviceable with small satellite numbers.
Graceful degradation means that if one satellite fails, the remaining satellites provide
needed services at a reduced level rather than a total loss of service. Section 7.6
discusses further the critical question of how we build up a constellation and how to
plan for graceful degradation.

Step 8. Create AV Budget

To numerically evaluate the cost of an orbit, we must create a AV budget for the
orbit, as described in Sec. 7.3. This then becomes the major component of the propel-
lant budget as described in Sec. 10.3.

Step 9. Document and Iterate

A key component of orbit or constellation design is documenting the mission
requirements used to define the orbit, the reasons for selecting the orbit, and the
numerical values of the selected orbit parameters. This baseline can be reevaluated
from time to time as mission conditions change. Because mission design nearly always
requires many iterations, we must make the iteration activity as straightforward as
possible and readdress orbit parameters throughout the design process to ensure they
meet all requirements.

7.2 Earth Coverage

Earth coverage refers to the part of the Earth that a spacecraft instrument* or
antenna can see at one instant or over an extended period. The coverage available for
a particular location or region is frequently a key element in mission design. In evalu-
ating coverage, two critical distinctions must be made. First, as Fig. 7-1 shows, the
instantaneous field of view, typically called the FOV or footprint, is the actual area the
instrument or antenna can see at any moment. In contrast, the access area is the total
area on the ground that could potentially be seen at any moment by turning the space-
craft or instrument. In the case of a truly omni-directional antenna, these two would
always be the same. For most operational instruments they are not.

The second important distinction is between the area which can be seen at any one
instant vs. the rate at which new land comes into view as the spacecraft and instrument
move. Both are important, and either can be vital to mission success. In geosynchro-
nous orbit, the instantaneous area is typically most important because the spacecraft is

* Throughout this section we will use instrument to refer to any spacecraft sensor or antenna for
which we want to compute coverage.

Footprint

ing Covered. The instantaneous access area is the total area in view.

nearly stationary relative to the Earth’s surface. In low-Earth orbit, satellites are mov-
ing rapidly over the surface, so the rate at which new land appears is usually critical.
The two distinctions above lead to four key parameters for Earth coverage:

* Footprint Area (,, also FOV area or instantaneous coverage area) = area
that a specific instrument or antenna can see at any instant.

¢ Instantaneous Access Area (IAA) = all the area that the instrument or antenna
could potentially see at any instant if it were scanned through its normal range
of orientations.

¢ Area Coverage Rate (ACR) = the rate at which the instrument or antenna is
sensing or accessing new land.

¢ Area Access Rate (AAR) = the rate at which new land is coming into the space-
craft’s access area.

For an instrument which covers all of the area available to it as the spacecraft moves
along, the coverage rate and access rate will be the same. For instruments operating
only part of the time or continuously selecting the region to be examined, the coverage
rate and access rate may be dramatically different. Generally the access area and
access rates depend only on the orbit and limiting geometry of the system, so we can
easily compute them with only a minimal knowledge of the detailed system design. On
the other hand, the actual area coverage rate during spacecraft operations may well
depend on the spacecraft control, power, and management systems, as well as the
details of mission operations.

Coverage assessment conveniently divides into two areas: first, an analytic assess-
ment to provide approximate formulas for coverage parameters as a function of
mission variables; second, numerical simulations to provide coverage Figures of Merit
for more detailed studies.

72 Earth Coverage 165

7.2.1 Analytic Approximations

In this section we present analytic approximations for various Earth coverage
parameters. All of the formulas here take into account the spherical surface of the
Earth, but do not account for oblateness, or the rotation of the Earth underneath the
orbit. These effects, in addition to those of coverage by multiple satellites, are ordi-
narily accounted for in numerical simulations as described in Sec. 7.2.2.

All of the formulas here are derived directly from the single-satellite geometry
described in Sec. 5.2. In particular, we will use the notation developed there and
summarized in Fig. 5-13 in Sec. 5.2. In this section we will parameterize coverage in
terms of the Earth central angle, A.* However, we can use Eqs. (5-24) to (5-28) to
transform each of the formulas below into one for either the spacecraft-centered nadir
angle, 7, or spacecraft elevation angle, €, seen from the ground.

As Fig. 7-1 shows, the instrument footprint is normally a beam with circular cross
section substantially smaller than the access area projected onto the Earth’s surface.
The nomenclature and computational geometry for the footprint are in Fig. 7-2. (For
instruments which see very large portions of the Earth, we can use the access area
formulas below. For those which have noncircular cross sections, the logic here along
with the formulas of Sec. 5.2 allows us to develop mission-specific formulas for
footprint size and area.)

The length (also called the height) of the footprint, Ly, is given by
Lp=K, Aro—Arp (7-1a)

where the variables are defined in Fig. 7-2 and, for A expressed in degrees,
* Amay be thought of either as an angle at the Earth’s center or as a distance measured along the

Earth’s surface. We will use these two views interchangeably as convenient for the problem
at hand.

K,=1 for length in deg
K,, = 111.319 543 for length in km
K,, = 60.107 7447 for length in nmi

Note: The linear approximation given in Eq. (7-1b) is computationally convenient
but can be very inaccurate, particularly near the horizon where € is small. (For a satel-
lite at an altitude of 1,000 km with a 1 deg diameter beam, the error in Eq. (7-1b) is
400% at €= 1 deg, 10% at e€= 15 deg, and 1% at € = 60 deg.) However, the alternative
computation of Eq. (7-1a) is much less convenient. To find the footprint length for a
given spacecraft elevation angle at the toe of the beam, ¢, we begin by computing 7
and A at the toe, then subtract the beam width, 0, from 7 to determine 17 at the heel,
compute A at the heel, and finally subtract to get the footprint length from Eq. (7-1a).
An alternative that improves the approximation somewhat is to use the center rather
than the toe of the beam. Because the toe represents the worst-case link budget (see
Chap. 13), it is most often used for performance computations and, therefore, is
commonly used for geometry calculations as well.

The footprint width, Wr, is given by

Wr = Rg sin“! (D sin 0/Rz) (7-2a)
~ D sin 0 (7-2b)

where Ry = 6,378.14 km is the radius of the Earth, @ is the beam width, and D is the
distance from the spacecraft to the toe of the footprint.* Here the error in the approxi-
mation in Eq. (7-2b) is proportional to 1 -(W;-/sin W;)' and is generally small relative
to other errors. Thus, Eq. (7-2b) is adequate for most practical applications.

Finally, if we assume that the projection on the ground is an ellipse, then the foot-
print area, F, , is given by

FE, = (0/4) Lp Wp (7-3)

Assuming that Lp was computed by Eq. (7-1a), the error in ignoring the curvature of
the Earth in Eq. (7-3) is again proportional to 1 - (W-/sin W,) and is negligible for
most applications.

The instantaneous area coverage rate for the beam is defined by

ACR instantaneous = fy /T (7-4)

where T is the exposure time or dwell time for the instrument. The average area
coverage rate, ACRaye, will also be a function of the duty cycle, DC, which is the
fraction of the total time that the instrument is operating, and the average overlap
between the footprint, O,,., which is the amount by which two successive footprints
cover the same area (typically about 20%):

R(1-oO DC 7-5

* In the case of a noncircular beam, Eq. (7-1) can be used with the beam width, 6, perpendicular
to the horizon and Eq. (7-2) can be used independently with the beam width parallel to the
horizon.

+ Here Wz should be expressed in radians as seen from the center of the Earth.

72 Earth Coverage 167

Computing the instantaneous access area, JAA, will depend on the shape of the
potential coverage area on the ground. Figure 7-3 shows several typical shapes. The
most common of these is Fig. 7-3A, which assumes that the instrument can work at
any point on the Earth within view for which the spacecraft elevation is above é. This
corresponds to a small circle on the Earth of radius A centered on the current sub-
satellite point. Some instruments, such as radar, cannot work too close to the subsatel-
lite point. As Fig. 7-3B shows, these instruments have both an outer horizon, A;, and

an inner horizon, Ap.

The instantaneous access areas or access lengths for the other patterns in Fig. 7-3
are given in Table 7-2, which also summarizes all of the coverage formulas for these
patterns. These access area formulas do take into account the curved surface of the
Earth and are accurate for any access area size or satellite altitude to within very small
corrections for the Earth’s oblateness.

We now wish to determine the length of time a particular point on the Earth is
within the satellite access area and the access area rate at which the land enters or
leaves the access area. Consider a satellite in a circular orbit at altitude H. The orbit
period, P, in minutes is given by

P = 1.658 669 x 10-4 x (6,378.14 + H)3/2 Hinkm (7-7)
P = 4.180 432 x 10-4 x (3,443.9 + H)3/2 H in nmi

We define the maximum Earth central angle, Ajq,, a8 the radius of the access area
for the observation in question. Twice Ajo, is called the swath width and is the width
of the coverage path across the Earth. As shown in Fig. 7-4, the coverage for any point
P on the surface of the Earth will be a function of A,,,,, and of the off-track angle, A,
which is the perpendicular distance from P to the satellite ground track for the orbit
pass being evaluated. The fraction of the orbit, F,,,,,, over which the point P is in view
is

Fyiew = AV/180 deg (7-8a)

which is equivalent to Eq. (5-49). Note that here we use A rather than A,,,;, for the off
ground-track angle and that Av is one half of the true anomaly range (i.e., angle along
the ground track) over which the point P is in view by the satellite. See Fig. 5-17 in
Sec. 5.3.1 for the geometry of this computation.

Finally, the area‘access rate as the satellite sweeps over the ground for the access
area of Fig. 7-3A is

AAR = (2 Kg sin A)/P (Pattern A) (7-10)

Formulas for other patterns are in Table 7-2. Again note that because of the curva-
ture of the Earth’s surface, this area access rate is not equal to the diameter of the
access area times the subsatellite point velocity.

As an example of the above computations, consider a spacecraft at 2,000 km
altitude with a 1 deg diameter beam staring perpendicular to the ground track at an
elevation angle of 10 deg as seen from the ground. Our linear estimate of the footprint
height is 446 km from Eq. (7-1b).* However, from Table 7-2 we see that the true height
is 355 km and therefore need to use the somewhat more complex Eq. (7-1a). From

* As indicated previously, this estimate would be substantially improved if the 10 deg elevation
angle was at the center of the beam. However, we would then need to keep track of beam-
center parameters for the geometry and beam-edge parameters for performance estimates.

170 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.2

Eqs. (5-24), (5-26), and (5-27) we determine Ago = 31.43 deg and Ayy= 28.24 deg. The
footprint width from Eq. (7-2a) is 77 km. From Eq. (7-3) the footprint area is 21,470
km2. The accuracy of the area is proportional to 1 — (77/6,378) / sin (77/6,378) =
0.002%. The ground track velocity is the circumference of the Earth divided by the or-
bit period (from Eq. 7-7) = 40,075 km/127 min = 315.6 km/min = 5.26 km/s. Mullti-
plying this by the footprint height of 355 km gives a crude estimate of the area
coverage rate of 1,867 km/s. Using the more accurate formula in Table 7-2 (Pattern
D) and the values of A above, we obtain a more accurate value of ACR = 2.556 x 108
x (sin 31.43 deg — sin 28.24 deg) / (127 x 60) = 1,620 km2/s which implies an error of
15% in the less accurate approximation.

The above formulas are in terms of off-ground-track angle, which is computation-
ally convenient. But we often need to know the coverage as a function of latitude, Lat,
for a satellite in a circular orbit at inclination, i. We assume that the pattern of
Fig. 7-3A applies and that observations can be made at any off-track angle less than or
equal to Ang, on either side of the satellite ground track. We also assume that Lat is
positive, that is, in the northern hemisphere. (The extensions are straightforward for
the southern hemisphere or nonsymmetric observations.) Depending on the latitude,
there will be either no coverage, a single long region of coverage, or two shorter
regions of coverage for each orbit as follows (See Fig. 7-5).

where the minus sign applies for @, and the plus sign for ¢>. Here @¢ is one-half the
longitude range over which coverage occurs. The formula in the third column above
represents the fraction of all points at a given latitude in view of the satellite during
one orbit. This is approximately equal to the fraction of orbits that will cover a given
point at that latitude.

As an example of the above formula, consider a satellite in a 62.5-deg inclined orbit
which can see to an off-ground-track angle, A,,,,, = 20 deg. At a ground station latitude
of 50 deg, the percent coverage will be 49.3%. On any orbit, 49% of the points at a
latitude of 50 deg will be within view of the satellite at some time. Conversely, a given
point at 50-deg latitude will be covered at some time on approximately 49% of the
satellite orbits. Because there is only one coverage region, the covered orbits will
occur successively during the day. If the satellite orbit period is 2 hr, then our
hypothetical ground station at 50-deg latitude will typically see the satellite on 6
successive orbits followed by 6 orbits of no coverage. The number and duration of
coverage passes on a given day will depend on where the ground station is located with
respect to the orbit node.

As a final example, consider a satellite in a 1,000-km circular orbit at an inclination
of 55 deg. From Eq. (5-24), in Sec. 5.2, 9 = 59.82 deg and from Eq. (7-7) the orbit
period is 105 min. We assume that the satellite can make observations out to a space-
craft elevation angle of 10 deg as seen by the target, corresponding to a nadir angle
Nmax = 58.36 deg from Eq. (5-26) and maximum off-track angle, Aj _, = 21.64 deg
from Eq. (5-27). From Eq. (7-10), the potential area search rate is 1.8 x 106 km2/min.
From Eq. (7-9) a point 15 deg from the ground track will remain in view for 9.2 min.
Finally, from Eqs. (7-11), a satellite in such an orbit will see 45.7% of all points at a
latitude of 50 deg and 33.4% of all points at a latitude of 20 deg.

7.2.2, Numerical Simulations

The analytic formulas above provide an easy and rapid way to evaluate Earth
coverage, but this approach has several limitations. It does not take into account non-
circular orbits, the rotation of the Earth under the spacecraft, or possible overlapping
coverage of several satellites. Although we could extend the analytic expressions,
numerically simulating the coverage is a better approach for more complex situations.
Any modern office computer can do a simple simulation that takes these effects into
account with sufficient accuracy for preliminary mission analysis.

Analytic approximations also do not allow us to assess coverage statistics easily.
For example, while we can determine the coverage time for a given orbit pass, we
cannot easily compute how often we will see a given point or where regions of cover-
age or gaps between coverage will occur. We usually need these statistics for Earth
observation applications.

Numerical simulations of coverage can become extremely complex. They may
consider such activities as scheduling, power and eclipse conditions, and observability
of the target or ground station. Chapter 3 briefly describes an example. In the follow-
ing paragraphs we will consider two simple simulations of considerable use during
preliminary mission design.

The simplest “simulation” is a ground track plot of the mission geometry, clearly
revealing how the coverage works and the possible coverage extremes. Figure 7-6
shows ground trace plots for our example satellite in a 1,000-km circular orbit with a
period P = 105 min, corresponding to approximately 14 orbits per day. The longitude
spacing, AL, between successive node crossings on the equator is

-360 deg (7-13)
The heavy circle on Fig. 7-6 represents the subsatellite points corresponding to
spacecraft elevations, €, greater than 5 deg (equivalent to A,,,,, < 25.6 deg). For the
25-deg latitude shown, we can see by inspection that we will see the point P on either
two or three successive upward passes and two or three successive downward passes.
The downward coverage passes will normally begin on the fourth orbit after the last
upward coverage pass. Individual passes within a group will be centered approxi-
mately 105 min apart and will be up to 105 x 51.2 / 360 = 14.9 min long.

Fig. 7-6. Ground Track of 8 Successive Orbits (out of 14 per day) for a Satellite at
1,000 km. The heavy circle covers subsatellite points over which spacecraft will be at
an elevation angle, e, greater than 5 deg. See text for discussion.

The details of each day’s potential observations will depend on how the orbit falls
relative to the point P. However, the general flow will be as follows. Two or three
passes of approximately 12 min each will occur 105 min apart. (Twelve minutes is
estimated by inspection relative to the maximum pass duration of 15 min.) After a
break of 5 hr, there will be another group of 2 or 3 passes. The process will repeat after
a break of 12 hr. Though we would like to have more statistical data, the ground track
analysis can rapidly assess performance, represent the coverage distribution, and
crosscheck more detailed results. From this process we could, for example, generate
timelines for the most and least coverage in one day.

The next step in the numerical modeling hierarchy is a point coverage simulation.
To do this, we conceptually create a grid of points on the surface of the Earth, fly one
or more spacecraft over the grid, and track the observation characteristics for each of
the grid points. We can then collect and evaluate data over different geographical
regions. The most common way is to collect data along lines of constant latitude and
present statistical coverage results as a function of latitude. This type of simulation is
an excellent way to evaluate coverage statistically. The main disadvantage is that it

72 Earth Coverage 173

does not let us see the problem physically or admit the general analytic studies
stemming from the formulas of Sec. 7.2.1. Thus, the best choice is to evaluate cover-
age by combining analytic formulas, ground trace plots, and numerical simulations.

Although the technique for the numerical point coverage simulation is straight-
forward, the analyst must be aware of three potential pitfalls. First, if we want to
compare coverage performance at different latitudes, then we need to have grid points
covering approximately equal areas over the surface of the globe. If grid points are at
equal intervals of latitude and longitude, (at every 10 deg, for example), then the
number of points per unit area will be much greater near the poles, thus incorrectly
weighting polar data in the overall global statistics. We can easily resolve this artificial
weighting by using grid points at a constant latitude spacing with the number of points
at each latitude proportional to the cosine of that latitude. This covers the globe with
an approximately equal number of points per unit area and properly balances the
global statistics.

Our second problem is to adjust for gaps where the simulation begins and ends.
Otherwise, these gaps will make gap statistics unrealistic because true gaps and
coverage regions will not begin and end at the start and end points of the simulation.
The easiest solution is to run the simulation long enough that start and end data have
minimal impact on the statistics.

The third, and perhaps most significant, problem is that we are trying to collect
Statistical data on a process for which statistical distributions do not apply. Most
statistical measures, such as the mean, standard deviation, or the 90th percentile
assume that the data being sampled has a Gaussian or random distribution. While the
distribution which we found by examining the ground track plot above was not
uniform, it was also not at all important for some activities. Our estimation of above 2
to 3 passes of 12 min each, twice per day, gives an average percent coverage on the
order of 1 hr/24 hr = 4%. But just collecting statistical data and concluding that the
percent coverage is about 4% is remarkably uniformative. That could be the result of
1 hr of continuous coverage and 23 hr of no coverage or 2.5 min of coverage every
hour. Similar problems plague all of the normal statistical measures applied to orbit
analysis. The important point is:

Statistical analysis of inherently nonstatistical data, such as orbit
coverage, can lead to dramatically incorrect conclusions.

Simple techniques such as ground track analysis are imperative to understand and
validate the conclusions we reach.

7.2.3 Coverage Figures of Merit

Having established a simulation technique, we need to find a way to accumulate
coverage statistics and to evaluate the quality of coverage. As described in Chap. 3, we
can quantify coverage quality by providing a coverage Figure of Merit (an appro-
priate numerical mechanism for comparing the coverage of satellites and constella-
tions). We wish to find a Figure of Merit which is physically meaningful, easy to
compute in our numerical simulation, and fair in comparing alternative constellations.
The most common general purpose coverage Figures of Merit are:

° Percent Coverage

The percent coverage for any point on the grid is simply the number of times
that point was covered by one or more satellites divided by the total number

174

Orbit and Constellation Design 72

of simulation time steps. It is numerically equal to the analytically computed
percent coverage in Eq. (7-11). The advantage of percent coverage is that it
shows directly how much of the time a given point or region on the ground is
covered. However, it does not provide any information about the distribution
of gaps in that coverage.

Maximum Coverage Gap (= Maximum Response Time)

The maximum coverage gap is simply the longest of the coverage gaps
encountered for an individual point. When looking at statistics over more than
one point, we can either average the maximum gaps or take their maximum
value. Thus the worldwide mean maximum gap would be the average value of
the maximum gap for all the individual points, and the worldwide maximum
gap would be the largest of any of the individual gaps. This statistic conveys
some worst-case information, but it incorrectly ranks constellations because a
single point or a small number of points determine the results. Thus, the
maximum coverage gap, or maximum response time, is a poor Figure of Merit.

Mean Coverage Gap

The mean coverage gap is the average length of breaks in coverage for a given

point on the simulation grid. To compute gap statistics, we must have three
counters for each point on the simulation grid. One counter tracks the number
of gaps. A second tracks total gap duration. The third tracks the duration of the
current gap and is reset as needed. During the simulation, if no satellite covers
a given point on the grid, we increment the gap length counter (3) by one time
step. If the point is covered but was not covered the previous time (indicated
by a value of the gap length counter greater than 0), then we have reached the
end of an individual gap. We increment the counter for the number of gaps (1)
by one and add the gap duration to the total gap counter (2) or incorporate it
in other statistics we want to collect. The final mean coverage gap is computed
by dividing the total gap length by the number of gaps. As noted above, what
happens at the beginning and end of the simulation influences all statistics
relating to gap distribution.

Time Average Gap

The time average gap is the mean gap duration averaged over time. Alterna-
tively, it is the average length of the gap we would find if we randomly
sampled the system. To compute the time average gap, two counters are
required-—one for the current gap length and one for the sum of the squares of
gap lengths. During the simulation, if no satellite covers a given point on the
grid, add one to the current gap length counter. If the point is covered, square
the current gap length, add the results to the sum of the squares counter, and
reset the current gap length counter to zero. (If the current gap length counter
was previously 0, then no change will have occurred in either counter.) The
time average gap is computed at the end of the simulation by dividing the sum
of the squares of the gaps by the duration of the simulation.

Mean Response Time

The mean response time is the average time from when we receive a random
request to observe a point until we can observe it. If a satellite is within view

7.2 Earth Coverage 175

of the point at a given time step, the response time at that step will be 0.* If the
point in question is in a coverage gap, then the response time would be the
time until the end of the coverage gap. In principle, response time should be
computed from a given time step to the end of a gap. But by symmetry we
could also count the time from the beginning of the gap—a computationally
convenient method with the same results. Thus the response time counter will
be set to O if a point is covered at the current time step. We advance the
response time counter by one time step if the point is not now covered. The
mean response time will then be the average value of all response times for all
time steps. This Figure of Merit takes into account both coverage and gap
Statistics in trying to determine the whole system’s responsiveness. As shown
below, the mean response time is the best coverage Figure of Merit for
evaluating overall responsiveness.

To illustrate the meaning and relative advantages of these Figures of Merit, Fig. 7-7
diagrams a simplified coverage simulation from three satellite systems: A, B, and C.
These could, for example, be three sample FireSat constellations. Our goal is to see
events as quickly as possible, and therefore, minimize gaps. Constellation B is
identical to A except for one added gap, which makes B clearly a worse solution than
A. C has the same overall percent coverage as A, but the gaps are redistributed to
create a rather long gap, making C the worst constellation for regular coverage.

* One advantage of response time as a Figure of Merit is that delays in processing or communi-
cations (for both data requests and responses) can be directly added to the coverage response
time. This results in a total response time, which measures the total time from when users
request data until they receive it. We can also evaluate minimum, mean, and maximum total
response times which have much more operational meaning than simple gap statistics but are
still easy to compute.

176 Orbit and Constellation Design 73

The table below Fig. 7-7 shows the numerical values of the Figures of Merit defined
above. The percent coverage correctly ranks constellation A better than B, but because
it does not take gap Statistics into account it cannot distinguish between A and C.
Similarly, the maximum gap cannot distinguish between A and B, even though B is
clearly worse by having an additional gap. In this-case the maximum gap tells us which
constellation is worst but cannot distinguish between two constellations which are
clearly different.

The mean gap statistic is even more misleading. By adding a short gap to constel-
lation B, the average length of the gaps has been decreased, and consequently, this
Figure of Merit ranks constellation B above constellation A. (This can happen in real
constellation statistics. By adding satellites we may eliminate some of the very small
gaps, thus increasing the average gap length, even though more satellites provide
more and better coverage.)

Finally, the time average gap and mean response time in the fourth and fifth
columns correctly rank the three constellations in order of preference by taking into
account both the percent coverage and gap statistics. Consequently, both of these are
better Figures of Merit than the other three. I believe the mean response time is the
stronger Figure of Merit because it provides a more useful measure of the end per-
formance of the system and because it can be easily extended to include delays due to
processing, communications, decision making, or the initiation of action. However,
because each of the Figures of Merit represent different characteristics we should
evaluate more than one. Specifically, I recommend evaluating mean response time,
percent coverage, and maximum gap, and qualitatively (not quantitatively) weighting
the results in that order, keeping strongly in mind the caveat at the end of Sec. 7.2.2.

7.3 The AV Budget

To an orbit designer, a space mission is a series of different orbits. For example, a
satellite may be released in a low-Earth parking orbit, transferred to some mission
orbit, go through a series of rephasings or alternative mission orbits, and then move to
some final orbit at the end of its useful life. Each of these orbit changes requires
energy. The AV budget is traditionally used to account for this energy. It is the sum of
the velocity changes required throughout the space mission life. In a broad sense the
AV budget represents the cost for each mission orbit scenario. In designing orbits and
constellations, we must balance this cost against the utility achieved.

Chapter 10 shows how to develop a propulsion budget based on a given AV budget.
For preliminary design, we can estimate the “cost” of the space mission by using the
rocket equation to determine the total required spacecraft plus propellant mass, my =
mg + mp, in terms of the dry mass of the spacecraft, mg, the total required AV, and the
propellant exhaust velocity, Vp:

my = me vO? (7-14)

This is equivalent to Eqs. (17-6) and (17-7) in Sec. 17.1, with V, replaced by Ispg,
where the specific impulse, I, = Vo/g, and g is the acceleration of gravity at the Earth’s
surface. Typical exhaust velocities are in the range of 2 to 4 km/s and up to 30 km/s
for electric propulsion. We can see from Eq. (7-14) that AV requirements much smaller
than the exhaust velocity (a few hundred meters per second), will require a propellant

73 The AV Budget 177

mass which is a small fraction of the total mass. If the total AV required is equal to the
exhaust velocity, then we will need a total propellant mass equal to e — 1 = 1.7 times
the mass of the spacecraft. Propulsion systems require additional structure such as
tanks, so a AV much greater than the exhaust velocity is difficult to achieve. It may
scuttle the mission or require some alternative, such as staging or refueling.

Table 7-3 summarizes how to construct a AV budget. We begin by writing down the
basic data required to compute AVs: the launch vehicle’s initial conditions, the mission
orbit or orbits, the mission duration, required orbit maneuvers or maintenance, and the
mechanism for spacecraft disposal. We then transform each item into an equivalent AV
requirement using the formulas listed in the table. The right-hand column shows how
these formulas apply to the FireSat mission. Figure 7-8 shows the AV required for
altitude maintenance for typical spacecraft and atmosphere parameters.

inversely proportional to the ballistic coefficient. The F10.7 index is in units of 10-22
W/(m2Hz). Ap is an index of geomagnetic activity ranging from 0 (very quiet) to 400
(extremely disturbed).

The AV budget relates strongly to the propulsion requirements and to the final cost
of a space mission. Yet other conditions may vary the propellant requirements relative
to the nominal AV budget. For example, although rocket propulsion usually provides
the AV, we can obtain very large AVs from a flyby of the Moon, other planets, or even
the Earth itself [Kaufman, Newman, and Chromey, 1966; Meissinger, 1970]. In a fly-
by, a spacecraft leaves the vicinity of some celestial body with the same velocity

relative to the body as when it approached, but in a different direction. This phenom-
enon is like the elastic collision between a baseball and a bat, in which the velocity of
the ball relative to the bat is nearly the same, but its velocity relative to the surrounding
baseball park can change dramatically. We can use flybys to change direction, to
provide increased heliocentric energy for solar system exploration, or to reduce the
amount of energy the satellite has in inertial space. For example, one of the most
energy-efficient ways to send a space probe near the Sun is to use a flyby of Jupiter to
reduce the intrinsic heliocentric orbital velocity of Earth associated with any space-
craft launched from Earth.

74 Selecting Orbits for Earth-Referenced Spacecraft 179

A second way to produce a large AV without burning propellant is to use the
atmosphere of the Earth or other planets to change the spacecraft’s direction or reduce
its energy relative to the planet. The manned flight program has used this method from
the beginning to dissipate spacecraft energy for return to the Earth’s surface. Mars
Pathfinder used aerobraking for planetary exploration. It can also be used to produce
a major plane change through an aeroassist trajectory [Austin, Cruz, and French,
1982; Mease, 1988].

The solar sail is a third way to avoid using propellant. The large, lightweight sail
uses solar radiation to slowly push a satellite the way the wind pushes a sailboat. Of
course, the low-pressure sunlight produces very low acceleration.

The aerospace literature discusses many alternatives for providing spaceflight
energy. But experimental techniques (those other than rocket propulsion and atmo-
spheric braking) are risky and costly, so normal rocket propulsion will ordinarily be
used to develop the needed AY, if this is at all feasible.

The AV budget described in Table 7-3 measures the energy we must give to the
spacecraft’s center of mass to meet mission conditions. When we transform this AV
budget into a propellant budget (Chap. 10), we must consider other characteristics.
These include, for example, inefficiencies from thrusters misaligned with the AV
direction, and any propulsion diverted from AV to provide attitude control during orbit
maneuvers. Chapters 10 and 17 describe propulsion requirements in detail.

For most circumstances, the AV budget does not include margin because it results
from astrodynamic equations with little error. Instead, we maintain the margin in the
propellant budget itself, where we can reflect such specific elements as residual
propellant. An exception is the use of AV to overcome atmospheric drag. Here the AV
depends upon the density of the atmosphere, which is both variable and difficult to
predict. Consequently, we must either conservatively estimate the atmospheric density
or incorporate AV margin for low-Earth satellites to compensate for atmospheric
variations.

7.4 Selecting Orbits for Earth-Referenced Spacecraft

The first step in finding the appropriate orbit for an Earth-referenced mission is to
determine if a specialized orbit from Table 7-4 applies.* We should examine each of
these orbits individually to see if its characteristics will meet the mission requirements
at reasonable cost. Space missions need not be in specialized orbits, but these orbits
have come into common use because of their valuable characteristics. Because they do
constrain such orbit parameters as altitude and inclination, we must determine whether
or not to use them before doing the more detailed design trades described below.

It is frequently the existence of specialized orbits which yields very different solu-
tions for a given space mission problem. Thus, a geosynchronous orbit may provide
the best coverage characteristics, but may demand too much propellant, instrument
resolution, or power. This trade of value versus cost can lead to dramatically different
solutions, depending on mission needs. For a traditional communications system, the
value of providing continuous communications coverage outweighs the cost and
performance loss associated with the distance to geostationary orbit. Some communi-
cations systems provide continuous coverage with a low-Earth orbit constellation as
described in Sec. 7.6. In the case of FireSat, continuous coverage is not required and

Earth orbits, the eccentricity will undergo a low-amplitude oscillation. A frozen orbit
is one which has a small eccentricity (~0.001) which does not oscillate due to a

the need for fine resolution on the ground for an IR detection system precluded a
geosynchronous orbit, so its mission characteristics are dramatically different. There
is no a priori way of knowing how these trades will conclude, so we may need to carry
more than one orbit into detailed design trades. In any case, we should reconsider
specialized orbits from time to time to see whether or not their benefits are indeed
worth their added constraints.

Orbit design is inherently iterative. We must evaluate the effects of orbit trades on
the mission as a whole. In selecting the orbit, we need to evaluate a single satellite vs.
a constellation, specialized orbits, and the choice of altitude and inclination. For
example, alternative solutions to a communications problem include a single large
satellite in geosynchronous equatorial orbit and a constellation of small satellites in
low-Earth orbit at high inclination.

The first step in designing mission orbits is to determine the effect of orbit param-
eters on key mission requirements. Table 7-5 summarizes the mission requirements
that ordinarily affect the orbit. The table shows that altitude is the most important of
orbit design parameter.

The easiest way to begin the orbit trade process is by assuming a circular orbit and
then conducting altitude and inclination trades as described below and summarized in
the table. This process establishes a range of altitudes and inclinations, from which we
can select one or more alternatives. Documenting the reasons for these results is
particularly important, so we can revisit the trade from time to time as mission require-
ments and conditions change.

Selecting the mission orbit is often highly complex, involving such choices as
availability of launch vehicle, coverage, payload performance, communication links,
and any political or technical constraints or restrictions. Thus, considerable effort may
go into the process outlined in Table 7-1. Figure 3-1 in Sec. 3.2.3 shows the results of
the altitude trade for the FireSat mission. Typically these trades do not result in
specific values for altitude or inclination, but a range of acceptable values and an
indication of those we would prefer. Ordinarily, low altitudes achieve better instru-

ment performance because they are closer to the Earth’s surface. They also require
less energy to reach orbit. On the other hand, higher orbits have longer lifetimes and
provide better Earth coverage. Higher orbits are also more survivable for satellites
with military applications. Orbit selection factors usually compete with each other
with some factors favoring higher orbits and some lower.

Often, a key factor in altitude selection is the satellite’s radiation environment. As
described in Sec. 8.1, the radiation environment undergoes a substantial change at
approximately 1,000 km. Below this altitude the atmosphere will quickly clear out
charged particles, so the radiation density is low. Above this altitude are the Van Allen
belts, whose high level of trapped radiation can greatly reduce the lifetime of
spacecraft components. Most mission orbits therefore separate naturally into either
low-Earth orbits (LEO), below 1,000 to 5,000 km, and geosynchronous orbits (GEO),

182 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.4

which are well above the Van Allen belts. Mid-range altitudes may have coverage
characteristics which make them particularly valuable for some missions. However,
the additional shielding or reduced life stemming from this region’s increased
radiation environment also makes them more costly.

Having worked the problem assuming a circular orbit, we should also assess the
potential advantages of using eccentric orbits. These orbits have a greater peak altitude
for a given amount of energy, lower perigee than is possible with a circular orbit, and
lower velocity at apogee, which makes more time available there. Unfortunately,
eccentric orbits also give us non-uniform coverage and variable range and speed.

Eccentric orbits have an additional difficulty because the oblateness of the Earth
causes perturbations which make perigee rotate rapidly. This rotation leads to rapid
changes in the apogee’s position relative to the Earth’s surface. Thus, with most orbits,
we cannot maintain apogee for long over a given latitude. As Sec. 6.2 describes, the
first-order rotation of perigee is proportional to (2 — 2.5 sin2i) which equals zero at an
inclination, i = 63.4 deg. At this critical inclination the perigee will not rotate, so we
can maintain both apogee and perigee over fixed latitudes. Because this orientation can
provide coverage at high northern latitudes, the Soviet Union has used such a Molniya
orbit for communications satellites for many years. Geosynchronous orbits do not
provide good coverage in high latitude regions.

Eccentric orbits help us sample either a range of altitudes or higher or lower
altitudes than would otherwise be possible. That is why scientific monitoring missions
often use high eccentricity orbits. As discussed in Sec. 7.6, Draim [1985, 1987a,
1987b] has done an extensive evaluation of the use of elliptical orbits and concluded
that they can have significant advantages in optimizing coverage and reducing the
number of satellites required.

FireSat Mission Orbit. Our first step for the FireSat mission orbit is to look at the
appropriateness of the specialized orbits from Table 7-4. This is done for FireSat in
Table 7-6. As is frequently the case, the results provide two distinct regimes. One pos-
sibility is a single geosynchronous FireSat. In this case, coverage of North America
will be continuous but coverage will not be available for most of the rest of the world.
Resolution will probably be the driving requirement.

TABLE 7-6. FireSat Specialized Orbit Trade. The conclusion is that in low-Earth orbit we do
not need a specialized orbit for FireSat. The frozen orbit can be used with any of the
low-Earth orbit solutions.

The alternative is a low-Earth orbit constellation. Resolution is less of a problem
than for geosynchronous. Coverage will not be continuous and will depend on the
number of satellites. None of the specialized low-Earth orbits is needed for FireSat. (A
frozen orbit can be used with essentially any low-Earth orbit.) Thus, for the low-Earth
constellation option, there will be a broad trade between coverage, launchability,
altitude maintenance, and the radiation environment.

For low-Earth orbit, coverage will be the principal driving requirement. Figure 3-1
in Sec. 3.2.3 summarized the FireSat altitude trades and resulted in selecting an alti-
tude range of 600 to 800 km with a preliminary value of 700 km. This may be affected
by further coverage, weight, and launch selection trades. FireSat will need to cover
high northern latitudes, but coverage of the polar regions is not needed. Therefore, we
select a preliminary inclination of 55 deg which will provide coverage to about 65 deg
latitude. This will be refined by later performance trades, but is not likely to change by
much.

Zero eccentricity should be selected unless there is a compelling reason to do
otherwise. There is not in this case, so the FireSat orbit should be circular. Thus, the
preliminary FireSat low-Earth orbit constellation has a = 700 km, i = 55 deg, e = 0,
and the number of satellites selected to meet minimum coverage requirements.

7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits

Selecting transfer, parking, and space-referenced orbits proceeds much the same as
for Earth-referenced orbits, although their characteristics will be different. Table 7-7
summarizes the main requirements. We still look first at specialized orbits and then at
general orbit characteristics. Table 7-8 shows the most common specialized orbits.
The orbits described in this section may be either the end goal of the whole mission or
simply one portion, but the criteria for selection will be the same in either case.

Space-Referenced Orbits.

7.5.1 Selecting a Transfer Orbit

A transfer orbit must get the spacecraft where it wants to be. For transfer orbits
early in the mission, the launch vehicle or a separate upper stage was traditionally
tasked with doing the work as described in Chap. 18. Because of the continuing drive
to reduce cost, integral propulsion upper stages have become substantially more
common (see Chap. 17).

Two distinct changes can occur during transfer orbit: a change in the total energy
of the satellite, and a change in direction without changing the total energy. As
discussed in Sec. 6.1, the total energy of a Keplerian orbit depends only on the semi-
major axis. Consequently, only transfer orbits which change the mean altitude, such as
transfer from LEO to GEO, require adding energy to the satellite. Clearly, if we wish
to go to an orbit with a higher energy level then we must find some process to provide
the additional energy, such as rocket propulsion or a lunar or planetary flyby. If we
must remove energy from the orbit, we can frequently use atmospheric drag.

A change in satellite direction without changing energy normally involves a plane
change (inclination or node), although we may also change the eccentricity without
changing the mean altitude. (Any small thrust perpendicular to the velocity cannot
change the orbit energy, or therefore, the mean altitude.) To change the satellite orbit
plane or eccentricity without changing the total energy, several options are available.

If we choose to change directions by using propulsion, then propellant require-
ments will typically be large; the AV required to change directions is directly
proportional to the spacecraft velocity, which is about 7 km/s in low-Earth orbit.
Fortunately, other techniques for changing the orbit plane require less energy. For
example, suppose we want to shift the node of an orbit to create a constellation with
nodes equally spaced around the Earth’s equator or to replace a dead satellite. If the
constellation is at an altitude other than that of the replacement satellite, we can use
the node regression provided by normal orbit perturbations. The rate at which the node
of an orbit precesses varies substantially with altitude, as described in Sec. 6.2.
Specifically, if we have a final constellation at a high altitude, we can inject and leave
the replacement satellite at low altitude so that the node rotates differentially with
respect to the high-altitude constellation. When the satellite reaches the desired node,
an orbit transfer is made with no plane change, thus using much less energy. In this
case we are trading orbit transfer time for energy.

A second way to reduce the AV for large plane changes is to couple them with
altitude changes. The net required AV will be the vector sum of the two perpendicular
components changing the altitude and direction—substantially less than if the two
burns were done separately.

7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits 185

Because the AV required to change the plane is directly proportional to satellite
velocity, plane changes are easier at high altitudes where the satellite velocity is lower.
That is why most of the plane change in geosynchronous transfer orbit is done at
apogee rather than perigee.

If the required plane change is large, it may cost less total propellant to use a three-
burn transfer rather than a two-burn transfer [Betts, 1977]. In this case, the first perigee
burn puts apogee at an altitude above the ultimate altitude goal, because the apogee
velocity is lower there. During a second burn, the plane change is made using a smaller
AV and perigee is raised to the final altitude. The third burn then brings apogee back
to the desired end altitude. This process is not more efficient for small plane changes
such as those associated with launch from mid-latitudes to geosynchronous equatorial
orbit. A third proposed way to make large plane changes is the aeroassist orbit
described in Sec. 7.3 [Austin, Cruz, and French, 1982; Mease, 1988].

Ordinarily, we want to transfer a satellite using the smallest amount of energy,
which commonly leads to using a Hohmann transfer as described in Sec. 6.3. How-
ever, as illustrated in Fig. 7-9 and described in Table 7-9, other objectives may
influence the selection of a transfer orbit. For example, we can reduce the transfer time
relative to a Hohmann orbit by using additional energy. These transfers are not
common, but they may be appropriate if transfer time is critical as might be true for
military missions or a manned mission to Mars.

We should also consider a low-thrust transfer, using low thrust chemical or
electrical propulsion. (See Chap. 17 for hardware information.) To do a low-thrust
chemical transfer with maximum acceleration of 0.05 to 0.10 g’s, the satellite under-
takes a series of burns around perigee and then one or two burns at apogee to reach the

final orbit, as illustrated in Fig 7-9C. In this case the total efficiency will approximate
that of a two-burn Hohmann transfer, because all of the energy is being provided near
perigee or apogee, as it is for the Hohmann transfer. With a low-thrust chemical
transfer, we can deploy and check out a satellite in low-Earth orbit where we can still
recover it before transferring it to a high-energy orbit where we cannot. Low-thrust
transfer provides substantially lower acceleration and, therefore, a more benign
environment. Also, we are more likely to be able to recover a satellite if the propulsion
system fails. The principal disadvantage of low-thrust chemical transfer is that it is a
very nontraditional approach. Wertz, Mullikin, and Brodsky [1988] and Wertz [2001]
describe low-thrust chemical transfer further.

Another type of low-thrust transfer uses electric propulsion, with extremely low
acceleration levels—at levels of 0.001 g or less [Cornelisse, Schéyer, and Wakker,
1979]. Transfer therefore will take several months, even when the motors are thrusting
continuously. Consequently, as Fig. 7-9D shows, electric propulsion transfer requires

75 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits 187

spiralling out, with increased total AV (see Table 7-9). We need far less total propellant
because of electric propulsion’s high /,,. Electric propulsion transfer greatly reduces
the total on-orbit mass and, therefore, the launch cost. However, much of the weight
savings is lost due to the very large power system required. In addition, the slow
transfer will keep the satellite longer in the Van Allen belts, where radiation will
degrade the solar array and reduce mission life.

Flybys or gravity-assist trajectories can save much energy in orbit transfers.
Because they must employ a swing-by of some celestial object, however, missions
near Earth do not ordinarily use them. Gravity-assist missions can use the Earth, but
the satellite must first recede to a relatively high altitude and then come back near the
Earth.* For a more extended discussion of gravity-assist missions, see Kaufman,
Newman, and Chromey [1966], or Wertz [2001]. Meissinger et al. [1997, 1998] and
Farquhar and Dunham [1998] have separately proposed interesting techniques for
using a different orbit injection process to substantially increase the mass available
(and, therefore, reduce the launch cost) for high-energy interplanetary transfers.

FireSat Transfer Orbit. We assume that FireSat will be launched into a 150-km,
circular parking orbit at the proper inclination and need to determine how to get to the
operational orbit of 700 km. For now, we assume some type of orbit transfer. When
the spacecraft weight becomes better known and a range of launch vehicles selected,
another trade will be done to determine whether it is more economical for the launch
vehicle to put FireSat directly into its operational orbit.

The FireSat orbit transfer AV from Table 7-3 is a modest 309 m/s. It is not worth
the added cost, solar array weight, or complexity for electric propulsion transfer. There
is no reason for a high-energy transfer. We are left to select between a Hohmann
transfer and a low-thrust chemical transfer. The Hohmann transfer is the traditional
approach.

Low-thrust chemical transfer provides a more benign transfer environment and the
potential for low-orbit deployment and checkout so that satellite recovery would be a
possibility. The propulsion system would be lighter weight and require less control
authority. We may be able to do the orbit transfer using just the mission orbit control
modes and hardware which could completely eliminate a whole set of components and
control logic.

For FireSat we will make a preliminary selection of low-thrust chemical transfer.
This is non-traditional, but probably substantially lower cost and lower risk. Later in
the mission design, the launch vehicle may eliminate this transfer orbit entirely.

7.5.2 Parking and Space-Referenced Orbits

In parking or space-referencéd orbits, the position of the spacecraft relative to the
Earth is unimportant except for blockage of communications or fields of view. Here
the goal is simply to be in space to observe celestial objects, sample the environment,
or use the vacuum or low-gravity of space. These orbits are used, for example, for
space manufacturing facilities, celestial observatories such as Space Telescope and
Chandra X-Ray Observatory, or for testing various space applications and processes.
Because we are not concerned with our orientation relative to the Earth, we select such
orbits to use minimum energy while maintaining the orbit altitude, and possibly, to
gain an unobstructed view of space. For example, Sun-synchronous orbits may be

*Using the Earth for a gravity assist was first proposed by Meissinger [1970].

188 Orbit and Constellation Design 76

appropriate for maintaining a constant Sun angle with respect to a satellite instrument.
Another example is the parking or storage orbit: a low-Earth orbit high enough to re-
duce atmospheric drag, but low enough to be easy to reach. We may store satellites
(teferred to as on-orbit spares) in these orbits for later transfer to other altitudes.

An interesting class of orbits which have been used for environmental monitoring
and proposed for space manufacturing are libration point orbits or Lagrange orbits,
named after the 18th century mathematician and astronomer, Joseph Lagrange. The
Lagrange points for two celestial bodies in mutual revolution, such as the Earth and
Moon or Earth and Sun, are five points such that an object placed at one of them will
remain there indefinitely. We can place satellites in “orbit” around the Lagrange points
with relatively small amounts of energy required to maintain these orbits. (For more
details, see Wertz [2001].)

7.6 Constellation Design

In designing a constellation, we apply all of the criteria for designing a single-
satellite orbit. Thus, we need to consider whether each satellite is launchable,
survivable, and properly in view of ground stations or relay satellites. We also need to
consider the number of satellites, their relative positions, and how these positions
change with time, both in the course of an orbit and over the lifetime of the
constellation.

Specifying a constellation by defining all of the orbit elements for each satellite is
complex, inconvenient, and overwhelming in its range of options. A reasonable way
to begin is by looking at constellations with all satellites in circular orbits ata common
altitude and inclination, as discussed in Sec. 7.4. This means that the period, angular
velocity, and node rotation rate will be the same for all of the satellites. This leads to
a series of trades on altitude, inclination, and constellation pattern involving prin-
cipally the number of satellites, coverage, launch cost, and the environment (primarily
drag and radiation). We then examine the potential of elliptical orbits and the addition
of an equatorial ring. The principal parameters that will need to be defined are listed
in Table 7-10. After exploring the consequences of some of the choices, we will
summarize the orbit design process in Sec. 7.6.2. A more detailed discussion is given
in Wertz [2001].

No absolute rules exist. A constellation of satellites in randomly spaced low-Earth
orbits is a serious possibility for a survivable communications system. The Soviet
Union has used a constellation of satellites in highly eccentric Molniya orbits for
decades. Various other missions may find satellite clusters useful. One of the most
interesting characteristics of the low-Earth orbit communications constellations is that
the constellation builders have invested billions of dollars and arrived at distinctly
different solutions. For example, a higher altitude means fewer satellites, but a much
more severe radiation environment (as discussed in Sec. 8.1), such that the cost of each
satellite will be higher and the life potentially shorter. Similarly, elliptical orbits allow
an additional degree of freedom which allows the constellation to be optimized for
multiple factors, but requires a more complex satellite operating over a range of
altitudes and velocities and passing through heavy radiation regimes. (See, for
example, Draim [1985].) Because the constellation’s size and structure strongly affect
a system’s cost and performance, we must carefully assess alternate designs and doc-
ument the reasons for final choices. It is this list of reasons that allows the constellation
design process to continue.

7.6.1 Coverage and Constellation Structure

For most constellations, Earth coverage is the key reason for using multiple satel-
lites.” A constellation can provide observations and communications more frequently
than a single satellite can. Given this objective, the normal trade in constellation design
is Coverage as a measure of performance versus the number of satellites as a measure
of cost. Thus, we normally assume that a five-satellite constellation will be less

* The principal alternative is the scientific satellite constellation which may, for example, want
to sample simultaneously the magnetosphere and solar particle flux at various locations and
altitudes.

190 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6

expensive than a six-satellite one, but this assumption may be wrong. The larger con-
stellation may be at a lower altitude or inclination and, therefore, cost less to launch or
have a less harsh radiation environment. Alternatively, we may be able to have a
smaller constellation with elliptical orbits, for which increased spacecraft complexity
could offset the lower cost due to the number of satellites.

A principal characteristic of any satellite constellation is the number of orbit planes
in which the satellites reside. Symmetry in constellation structure requires an equal
number of satellites in each orbit plane. This means that an eight-satellite constellation
may have either one, two, four, or eight separate orbit planes. But because moving
satellites between planes uses much more propellant than moving them within a plane,
it is highly advantageous to place more satellites in a smaller number of planes.
Moving satellites within an orbit plane requires only a slight change in the satellite
altitude. This changes the period so we can slowly rephase the satellite within the con-
stellation, and then return it to the proper altitude to maintain its position relative to the
rest. Thus, we can rephase many times using relatively little propellant. If a satellite
fails or a new satellite is added to a given orbit plane, we can rephase the remaining
satellites so that they are uniformly spaced. The consequence of this is to provide a
significant premium to constellations which contain more satellites in a smaller
number of orbit planes.

The number of orbit planes relates strongly to a coverage issue often overlooked in
constellation design: the need to provide the constellation both performance plateaus
and graceful degradation. Ideally one would like to achieve some performance level
with the very first satellite launched and to raise that level of performance with each
succeeding satellite. Generally, however, performance tends to come in plateaus as we
put one more satellite into each orbit plane of the final constellation. If a constellation
has seven orbit planes, we will achieve some performance with the first satellite, but
the next major performance plateau may not come until one satellite is in each of the
seven planes. We would expect this constellation to have plateaus at one, seven, four-
teen, twenty-one, (and so on) satellites. Again, constellations with a small number of
orbit planes have a distinct advantage over many-plane ones. A single-plane constel-
lation produces performance plateaus with each added satellite, whereas one with two
planes would have plateaus at one, two, four, six, eight, (and so on) satellites. Thus,
more complex constellations will require more satellites for each performance plateau.

Frequent performance plateaus have several advantages. First, because individual
satellites are extremely expensive, we may want to build and launch one or two
satellites to verify both the concept and the constellation’s ultimate usefulness. If a
constellation is highly useful with just one or two satellites, it offers a major advantage
to the system developer.

Another advantage is that coverage requirements are rarely absolute. More cover-
age is better than less, but we may not know at the time the constellation is designed
how useful added coverage will be. For example, we may design the FireSat system
for 30-min revisits, then later revise the response strategy so 45-min revisits can
provide nearly equal performance. Communications constellations are normally
thought of as having a very rigid requirement of continuous global coverage. Even
here, however, they may want more coverage or greater redundancy over regions of
high population density.

A constellation of one or two planes can be more responsive to changing user needs
than a system with multiple planes can. Because we often design constellations many
years before many launch, we may not be able to correctly balance performance vs.

7.6 Constellation Design 191

cost. Both needs and budgets follow political constraints and economic priorities over
much shorter periods than a constellation’s lifetime. Thus if an eight-satellite constel-
lation is highly useful with only six satellites, budget constraints may delay the launch
of the remaining two.” At the same time, the constellation may expand to ten satellites
if the first set generates substantial demand for more performance or greater capacity.
This responsiveness to political and performance demands provides perhaps the
largest advantage to constellations with a smaller number of orbit planes.

Finally, a smaller number of orbit planes leads to more graceful degradation. In an
eight-satellite, two-plane constellation, if one satellite is lost for any reason, we may
rephase the constellation at little propellant cost and thereby maintain a high perfor-
mance level corresponding to a six-satellite plateau. This rephasing and graceful
degradation may be impossible for constellations with a large number of orbit planes.

Another important characteristic is the orbit inclination. In principle, one could
design satellite constellations with many different inclinations to get the best coverage.
In practice this is extremely difficult because the rate of nodal regression for a satellite
orbit is a function of both altitude and inclination. Consequently, satellites at a
common altitude but different inclinations will regress at different rates, and a set of
orbit planes which initially have a given geometric relationship with respect to each
other will change that relationship with time. Otherwise, we would have to expend
propellant to maintain the relative constellation spacing, a technique that is extremely
expensive in terms of propellant and is achievable for only a short time or under unique
circumstances. Thus, we usually design constellations to have all the satellites at the
same inclination. A possible exception is to have all satellites at a single inclination
except for a set of satellites in a 0 inclination (equatorial) orbit. Regression of the
nodes is not meaningful for the equatorial orbit, so we can maintain constant relative
phasing indefinitely between satellites in equatorial and inclined orbits, An example
of such a constellation is satellites in three mutually perpendicular orbit planes—two
polar and one equatorial.

As shown in Fig. 7-10, the spacing between satellites in a single orbit plane
determines whether coverage in that plane is continuous and the width of the con-
tinuous coverage region. Assume that A,,,,, is the maximum Earth central angle as
defined in Sec. 5.3.1 and that there are N satellites equally spaced at S = 360/N deg
apart in a given orbit plane. There is intermittent coverage throughout a swath of half-
width A,,gy. If S > 2 Amgy, the coverage is intermittent throughout the entire swath. If
S <2 Ang, there is a narrower swath, often called a street of coverage, centered on the
ground trace and of width 2 A,,,-.¢;, in which there is continuous coverage. This width
is given by:

COS Astree = COS Agy/ cos (S/2) (7-15)

If the satellites in adjacent planes are going in the same direction, then the “bulge” in
one orbit can be used to offset the “dip” in the adjacent orbit as shown in Fig. 7-11. In
this case, the maximum perpendicular separation, D,,q,, between the orbit planes
required for continuous coverage is

Dinaxs = Astreet + Amax (moving in the same direction) (7-16)

* One hopes that procuring agencies will not purposely select a rigid alternative to protect
budgets.

If the satellites are moving in opposite directions, then the bulge and dip cannot be
made to line up continuously and, therefore,

Daxd = 2 Astreet (moving opposite directions) (7-17)

This leads to a polar constellation often called Streets of Coverage, illustrated in
Fig. 7-12, in which M planes of N satellites are used to provide continuous global
coverage. At any given time, satellites over half the world are going northward and sat-
ellites over the other half are going southward. Within both regions, the orbit planes
are separated by D,,,,,5. Between the two halves there is a seam in which the satellites
are going in opposite directions. Here the spacing between the planes must be reduced
to Dnaxo in order to maintain continuous coverage.

This pattern clearly shows another critical characteristic of constellations—cover-
age does not vary continuously and smoothly with altitude. There are discrete

jumps in coverage which depend primarily on A,,,,, which, in turn, depends on the
minimum elevation angle, €,,;,, and the altitude (See Eqs. 5-35 and 5-36). If we keep
Emin fixed and lower the constellation altitude, then we will reach an altitude plateau
at which we will need to add another orbit plane, and N more satellites, to cover the
Earth. The Iridium communications constellation was originally intended to have 77
satellites in a streets of coverage pattern. (The element iridium has an atomic number
of 77.) By slightly increasing the altitude and decreasing the minimum elevation angle,
the number of orbit planes was reduced by one, and the number of satellites required
for continuous coverage was reduced to only 66. (Unfortunately, dysprosium is not a
compelling constellation name.)

As the altitude changes, the fundamental constellation design changes and, conse-
quently, the number of satellites and coverage characteristics change in steps. As a
result, we cannot provide a meaningful chart of, for example, number of satellites vs.
altitude without examining different constellation designs at different altitudes. While
we may use this sort of chart to estimate constellation size, it would not provide
realistic data for orbit design.

Requirements other than coverage can also be important in constellation design, but
most are directly related to coverage issues. For example, we may need several satel-
lites to cover a point on the ground or in space at the same time. Navigation with GPS
requires that four satellites be in view with a reasonably large angular separation. A
similar requirement is cross-link connectivity among satellites in the constellation.
Cross-link connectivity is geometrically the same issue as overlapping coverage. At
any time when the coverage of two satellites overlaps (that is, they can both see at least
one common point on the ground), then the two satellites can see each other and we
can establish a cross-link. Thus, forming cross-links is equivalent to the problem of
multiple coverage.

Even apparently simple design problems can be very difficult, with solutions
depending on various mission conditions. Perhaps the simplest constellation design
problem is the question ‘What is the minimum number of satellites required to provide

194 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6

continuous coverage of the Earth?” In the late 1960s, Easton and Brescia [1969] of the
United States Naval Research Laboratory analyzed coverage by satellites in two
mutually perpendicular orbit planes and concluded we would need at least six satellites
to provide complete Earth coverage. In the 1970s, J.G. Walker [1971, 1977, 1984] at
the British Royal Aircraft Establishment expanded the types of constellations
considered to include additional circular orbits at a common altitude and inclination.
He concluded that continuous coverage of the Earth would require five satellites.
Because of his extensive work, Walker constellations are a common set of
constellations to evaluate for overall coverage. More recently in the 1980s, John
Draim [1985, 1987a, 1987b] found and patented a constellation of four satellites in
elliptical orbits which would provide continuous Earth coverage. A minimum of four
satellites are required at any one instant to provide full coverage of the Earth.
Consequently, while the above progression looks promising, the 1990s are unlikely to
yield a three-satellite full Earth coverage constellation or the 2000s a two-satellite
constellation.

While extensively studying regular, circular orbit patterns, Walker [1984]
developed a notation for labeling orbits that is commonly used in the orbit design
community and frequently used as a starting point for constellation design. Spe-
cifically, the Walker delta pattern contains a total of ¢ satellites with s satellites evenly
distributed in each of p orbit planes. All of the orbit planes are assumed to be at the
same inclination, i, relative to a reference plane—typically the Earth’s equator. (For
constellation design purposes, this need not be the case. But orbit perturbations depend
on the inclination relative to the equator and, therefore, the equator is the most practi-
cal standard reference plane.) Unlike the streets of coverage, the ascending nodes of
the p orbit planes in a Walker pattern are uniformly distributed around the equator at
intervals of 360 deg/p. Within each orbit plane the s satellites are uniformly distributed
at intervals of 360 deg/s.

The only remaining issue is to specify the relative phase between the satellites in
adjacent orbit planes. To do this we define the phase difference, Ad, in a constellation
as the angle in the direction of motion from the ascending node to the nearest satellite
at a time when a satellite in the next most westerly plane is at its ascending node. In
order for all of the orbit planes to have the same relationship to each other, A@ must be
an integral multiple, f, of 360 deg/t, where f can be any integer from 0 to p — 1. So long
as this condition holds, each orbit wil] bear the same relationship to the next orbit in
the pattern. The pattern is fully specified by giving the inclination and the three
parameters, t, p, and f. Usually such a constellation will be written in the shorthand
notation of i: t/p/f. For example, Fig. 7-13 illustrates a Walker constellation of 15/5/1
at i= 65 deg. Table 7-11 gives the general rules for Walker delta pattern parameters.

While Walker constellations are important to constellation design, they are not the
only appropriate options and do not necessarily provide the best characteristics for a
given mission. Walker intended to provide continuous multiple coverage of all the
Earth’s surface with the smallest number of satellites. This plan may or may not meet
all the goals of a particular program. For example, equally distributed coverage over
the Earth’s surface may not be the most beneficial. We may wish to provide global
coverage with the best coverage at the poles, mid-latitude regions, or the equator. In
these cases, we may want constellation types other than Walker orbits.

If the regions of interest do not include the poles, then an equatorial constellation
may provide all of the coverage with a single orbit plane, which leads to flexibility,
multiple performance plateaus, and graceful degradation. Thus, for example, if all of

the regions of interest were within 50 deg of the equator, we would want to consider a
constellation having several equatorial satellites with enough altitude to provide the
appropriate coverage at the smallest spacecraft elevation angle.

If all or most regions of interest are above a given latitude, a directly polar constel-
lation would allow all satellites to see the region of the pole on every orbit. Thus, if all
targets of interest were within 50 deg of the pole, a polar constellation with a single
orbit plane could provide excellent coverage. If most targets were in the polar region

196 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6

with lesser interest in the equatorial regions, a two-plane polar constellation could
provide continuous or nearly continuous coverage of the pole while providing reduced
but good coverage of the equatorial regions. One might also consider a mix of polar or
high inclination satellites with some satellites at the equator to provide the added
coverage needed there.

Another class of non- Walker constellations consists of two planes at right angles to
each other. If both planes are perpendicular to the equator it will be a polar constella-
tion. Although it will have substantial symmetry, it is not one of the Walker delta
patterns. The two planes can also be tipped relative to the equator to achieve any
inclination from 90 to 45 deg. Again the ascending nodes are such that they are not
Walker constellations except when the inclination is 45 deg, in which case they reduce
to a Walker two-plane configuration. Figure 7-14 shows examples of several non-
Walker constellations.

7.6 Constellation Design 197

A final example of non-Walker constellations is the Molniya orbits used for
Russian communication satellites. Sections 6.2 and 7.4 describe them in more detail.
As mentioned above, these constellations can fully cover high northern latitudes while
requiring much less energy than circular high-altitude orbits.

7.6.2 Summary of Constellation Design

_ Constellation design is complex, requiring us to assess many issues and orbit char-
acteristics. We must certainly pick a preliminary design, but this complexity demands
that we document the reasons for that design and remain aware of alternatives as orbit
design continues. Unfortunately, systematic reassessments of constellation design are
difficult under typical budget constraints and the constellation pattern is often locked
in very early in mission design.

Unfortunately, we cannot use analytic formulas to design a constellation. With
numerical simulation, we can evaluate some of the Figures of Merit defined in
Sec. 7.2. (That section discusses how to lay out the simulation for unbiased results.)
Generally the results of such a simulation are best expressed as Figures of Merit vs.
latitude for the various performance plateaus. Thus, a typical decision plot might
include mean response, percent coverage, and maximum gap as a function of latitude
for the various constellations being considered. Often, we must also evaluate coverage
data for different instruments on board a spacecraft. Each instrument has its own
coverage area and, therefore, a different swath width will apply for each principal
observation type. Thus, the coverage associated with one instrument may differ
dramatically from that associated with another instrument or operating mode. Alterna-
tive operating modes or instruments will likely lead us to prefer distinctly different
constellation designs. We may then choose either different satellites or a compromise
between the alternative instruments or modes.

Table 7-12 summarizes the constellation design process. Wertz [2001] provides a
much more extended discussion of constellation design and techniques for evaluating
the factors involved. Mora et al. [1997] provide an excellent chronological summary
of constellation design methods. As with single-satellite orbits, we normally start by
assuming circular orbits at a common altitude. Depending upon the coverage
requirements, I recommend beginning with either the Walker delta orbits, the one-
plane equatorial, or streets of coverage polar orbits. We should also consider elliptical
orbits, either as a full constellation or to fill in missing coverage. Generally, we
evaluate each constellation design for three criteria:

¢ Baseline Coverage vs. Latitude

The coverage associated with different instruments or operating modes is best
expressed as coverage vs. latitude (see Secs. 7.2.2 and 7.2.3). I regard the mean
response time as the best overall measure of coverage, although percent
coverage and maximum gap can also be important in some applications. We
must use the maximum gap measure carefully because this single point should
not be allowed to drive the design of an entire constellation as it will typically
not provide the best overall performance for the cost.

* Growth and Degradation

As described in Sec. 7.6.1, this is a key issue in practical constellation design.
It will be different for each constellation type. In evaluating growth and deg-
radation we should assume that rephasing within the orbit plane can be done at
very modest propellant cost, and that changing orbit planes is not feasible.

intersatellte distances at plane crossings for collision

6. Review the rules of constellation design in Table 7-13. Table 7-13
7. Document reasons for choices and iterate. Po

¢ Existence of Altitude Plateaus

We should evaluate each constellation to see if plateaus exist in which the
number of orbit planes or other key characteristics make a discrete step. Pla-
teaus may be different for different instruments and operating modes, but usu-
ally are functions of the swath width for each instrument or operating mode.

There are no absolute rules for choosing the proper constellation. Selection is based
on the relative importance of the various factors to the owners and users of the
constellation. A summary of the most common rules and the reason for them is given
in Table 7-13. As with all aspects of mission design, we must document our selection,
our reasons, and the coverage characteristics. It is critical to keep in mind possible
alternatives and to reevaluate orbits with advances in mission definition and
requirements.

Finally, one of the most important characteristics of any constellation is collision
avoidance. The reason for this is not merely the loss of the satellites which collide
because we anticipate losing satellites for many reasons in any large constellation. The
fundamental problem is the debris cloud that results from any satellite collision. The
velocity imparted to the particles resulting from the collision is small relative to the
orbital velocity. Consequently, the net effect of a collision is to take two trackable,
possibly controllable satellites and transform them into thousands of untrackable

significant advantages and no disadvantages compared to relative

particles that spread out with time in the same orbits as the original satellites.
Because the energy is proportional to mv2, even a small piece of a satellite carries an
enormous amount of kinetic energy at orbital velocities.” Because the debris cloud re-
mains in the constellation orbit, it dramatically increases the potential for secondary
collisions which, in turn, continues to increase the amount of debris and the possibility
of making the orbit “uninhabitable.” The implication for constellation design is that
we should go to great lengths to design the constellation and the spacecraft to avoid
collisions, explosions, or generation of extraneous debris. Methods for doing this are
summarized in Table 7-14.
