Preface

Space Mission Analysis and Design, known as SMAD to its many friends, has
gained widespread use as a text and reference throughout the astronautics community.
The purpose of the third edition of SMAD is to both update the book and make it more
useful and more practical wherever possible. Some topics, such as astrodynamics and
mission geometry, have changed relatively little since publication of the second edi-
tion in 1992. Here we have made minor modifications to make the material clearer and
more precise. On the other hand, topics such as space computers and the design of
observation payloads have been nearly completely rewritten. Because of the growing
interest in “LightSats” and low-Earth orbit constellations we have added a SmallSat
cost model, expanded the discussion of constellation design, and included a new sec-
tion on multi-satellite manufacturing. The entire volume reflects a greater emphasis on
reducing mission cost and doing more with less people and fewer resources.” Finally,
the FireSat sample mission has been extended further and the appendices and end mat-
ter updated and expanded to provide greater utility as a quick reference. We hope the
new edition is better and more useful to you.

As with the first two editions, the goal of the book to is allow you to begin with a
“blank sheet of paper” and design a space mission to meet a set of broad, often poorly
defined, objectives at minimum cost and risk. You should be able to define the mission
in sufficient detail to identify principal drivers and make a preliminary assessment of
overall performance, size, cost, and risk. The emphasis is on low-Earth orbit, un-
manned spacecraft. However, we hope the principles are broad enough to be applica-
ble to other missions as well. We intend the book to be a practical guide, rather than a
theoretical treatise. As much as possible, we have provided physical and engineering
data, rules of thumb, empirical formulas, and design algorithms based on past experi-
ence. We assume that the reader has a general knowledge of physics, math, and basic
engineering, but is not necessarily familiar with any aspect of space technology.

The third edition represents an amalgam of contributions over the last decade by
many engineers and managers from throughout the community. It reflects the insight
gained from their practical experience, and suggests how things might be done better
in the future. From time to time the views of authors and editors conflict, as must nec-
essarily occur given the broad diversity of experience. We believe it is important to
reflect this diversity rather than suppress the opinions of individual experts. Similarly,
the level of treatment varies among topics, depending both on the issues each author
feels is critical and our overall assessment of the level of detail in each topic that is
important to the preliminary mission analysis and design process.

* The continuing, unrelenting demand to drive down mission cost has led to the creation a
companion volume to SMAD, Reducing Space Mission Cost [Wertz and Larson, 1996], which
addresses cost reduction in all aspects of mission design and includes 10 case studies of how
the process works in practice.

Xvi
Preface xvii

The book is intended as a textbook for either introductory graduate or advanced
undergraduate courses, or as a reference for those already working in space tech-
nology. It can also provide valuable supplementary material for related courses such
as spacecraft design or space mission operations. We believe the book can be a key
tool for payload designers who need to find out more about space mission design and
for those charged with the responsibility of developing space mission requirements
and specifications. Finally, we hope that it will be of use to many system engineers in
this field who have a detailed knowledge of one area, but need to broaden their back-
ground or verify their understanding in related topics.

The book is meant to be read sequentially, although most of the chapters are self-
contained, with references to other parts of the book as needed. For readers with
specific interests, we recommend the following:

Those concerned primarily with mission analysis and design should read
Chaps. 1-9 and 19-23.

Those concerned with spacecraft and subsystem design should read Chaps. 1,
2, 4, 8-13, and 16-23.

Those concerned primarily with mission operations and the ground interaction
should read Chaps. 1, 2, 4, and 13-16.

Those concerned with requirements definition, logistics, and putting a space
system in place should read Chaps. 1-4, 7, 9, 10, and 18-23.

Those interested in constellation design and multi-satellite systems should
read Chaps. 1-9, 13-16, and 19-23.

Those interested in reducing mission cost and the design of low-cost missions
should read Chaps. 1-3, 7-10, 12, 20-23, and the companion volume, Reduc-
ing Space Mission Cost.

SI (metric) units are used throughout the book. Conversions for essentially all
common units are contained in Appendix F. Conversion factors and physical constants
are generally given to their full available accuracy so that they can be inserted into
computer programs and not considered further. As discussed in the introduction to the
appendices, the values given are those adopted by the National Bureau of Standards
based on a least-squares fit to the fundamental physical constants or international
agreement on the definitions of various units. In the case of astronomical constants,
values adopted by the International Astronomical Union are given. The most com-
monly used astronautical formulas and constants are in the appendices. An expanded
table of space mission parameters for Earth orbits is on the inside back endleaf. For
those wishing to expand that table or use it for other central bodies, the formulas used
for creating it are on the preceding pages.

Leadership, funding, and support essential to updating the book were provided by
numerous programs at the Air Force Space and Missile Center, Air Force Space
Command, NASA Headquarters, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, and the
Advanced Projects Research Agency. Obtaining funding to create and maintain
much-needed reference material is exceptionally difficult. We are deeply indebted to
the sponsoring organizations, particularly Air Force Phillips Laboratory, for their
support and their recognition of the importance of projects such as this one.

The third edition of this book is the result of nearly two years of effort by a
dedicated team of government, industry, and academic professionals. The Department
of Astronautics, United States Air Force Academy, provided unwavering support for
xviii Preface

the project. Michael DeLorenzo, Chairman of the Department of Astronautics,
provided the leadership and continuing support critical to projects of this type. Both
Doug Kirkpatrick and Perry Luckett performed a detailed grammatical review in a
valiant effort to prevent the rest of us from demonstrating why we became engineers
rather than writers. Several graphics artists at the Academy, particularly Mary
Tostanoski and Debra Porter, spent many hours developing and updating artwork.
Joan Aug and Bert Reinertson cheerfully handled the huge administrative burden at
the Academy. Numerous faculty members, staff, and students graciously sacrificed
their time to provide assistance, review, and comments. Daryl Boden assisted with the
editing and reviewing even after changing assignments to the Naval Academy. Doug
Kirkpatrick managed the task for the Air Force with great skill and patience and
reviewed nearly all of the material for both technical and linguistic correctness!

OAO Corporation, Colorado Springs, Colorado, provided the contract support for
the project. Anita Shute at the Air Force Academy spent many hours revising drafts,
creating artwork, and working all aspects of the project. Eugene deGeus of Kluwer
Academic Publishers supplied substantial assistance with all aspects of the publishing
activity. This was his final project at Kluwer before taking a science administration
position with the Dutch government. We will miss his wisdom and guidance and wish
him the best of future success.

At Microcosm, the entire analysis and publications staff worked virtually all
aspects of the book (art, grammar, equation checking, technical reviews, and camera-
ready copy) and suffered patiently through “the book project” as it continually
absorbed great amounts of limited resources. Much of the new graphics was done by
undergraduate students Karen Burnham, Paul Murata, Alan Chen, and Julie Wertz
under the very capable guidance of Kevin Polk and Simon Dawson. Jennifer Burnham
and Judith Neiger did much of the proofing. Robert Bell did most of the demanding
task of updating units and conversion factors. John Collins created the new FireSat
cost model. Wendi Huntzicker and Joy Sakaguchi created the new camera-ready copy
for most of the book. Joy and Chris deFelippo did much of the new art. Finally, Donna
Klungle did a truly remarkable job managing, administering, editing, reviewing, and
preparing revisions, drafts, and the final camera-ready copy. Donna accomplished this
with skill and good humor, while dealing with the conflicting demands of multiple au-
thors and editors.

Arthur Cox of Lawrence Livermore National Labs and the editors of Astrophysical
Quantities [1999] graciously permitted the use of drafts of their forthcoming volume
so that we could obtain the most current values for physical quantities. We highly
recommend that readers consult Astrophysical Quantities for solar system and astro-
nomical parameters which are not contained here.

Every effort has been made to eliminate mathematical and factual errors. Many
errors from prior editions have been found largely through readers’ comments and
constructive criticism. Please continue to send any errors, omissions, corrections, or
comments to either editor at the addresses below. We sincerely hope that the book will
be of use to you in our common goal of reducing the cost and complexity of space
utilization.

Finally, one of the most exciting aspects of space mission analysis and design is that
after 40 years of space exploration we have only begun to scratch the surface of the
variety of important missions that can and should be done. In spite of problems, set-
backs, and higher costs than any of us would like, people young and old remain excited
about space. The exploration of space will take dramatic new turns in the future, from
Preface xix

communications constellations and microgravity work now beginning to become a
reality to solar power satellites, space tourism, space industrialization, and settlements
on the Moon and planets which are still to be designed. We hope that this volume
provides a portion of the roadmap and incentive to those who will undertake these
tasks. We wish you the best of success in this endeavor.
