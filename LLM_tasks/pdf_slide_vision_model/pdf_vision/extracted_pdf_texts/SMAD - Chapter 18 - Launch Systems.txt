18.3. Determining the Spacecraft Design Envelope and
Environments

The launch process can.severely constrain spacecraft design. Primary restrictions
are the launch vehicle’s lift capability and the environment to which it subjects the
satellite during ascent. A launch system consists of a basic launch vehicle incorporat-
ing one or more stages and an infrastructure for ground support. It alters velocity to
place the spacecraft in orbit, creates a severe ascent environment, and protects the
spacecraft from its surroundings. Ultimately, it places the payload into the desired
orbit with a functional spacecraft attitude. In this chapter the term payload includes all
hardware above the launch-vehicle-to-spacecraft interface, excluding the payload’s
protective fairing, which is usually part of the launch system. Thus, the launch-vehicle
payload consists of the entire spacecraft above the booster adapter interface. For the
Shuttle, it is customary to speak of the payload as the spacecraft to be deployed or the
sortie mission payload to be operated from the payload bay with the Shuttle providing
all of the support functions. Shuttle missions normally accommodate both types of
payloads on each flight.

The aerospace industry has typically managed launch vehicles in one organization
and spacecraft in another, reinforcing a tendency to budget and manage at the inter-
face. This approach has been, and in many cases will continue to be, successful.
However, we must continue to ensure it leads to the most cost-effective technical and
management solutions. For example, traditional interfaces may not be appropriate as
new generations of maneuverable spacecraft with their own inertial references become
common. These spacecraft-borne inertial platforms could be used to guide and
navigate launch systems, replacing similar systems in the launch vehicle.

Over the last 30 years, launch vehicle performance has improved tenfold while
reliability has slowly increased from 0.85 to roughly 0.95. Planners often do not
appreciate that launch-system reliability and cost are keys to a successful mission.
Because the spacecraft usually costs more than the launch system, it can be very cost-
effective to spend a bit more for a launch system with more reliability.

18.1 Basic Launch Vehicle Considerations

Space launch systems are unique forms of transportation since they are the only
systems that accelerate continuously throughout their performance envelope. Conse-
quently, velocity is the fundamental measure of performance for launch systems. A
launch system’s ability to achieve orbital velocity comes primarily from its propulsion
efficiency, with vehicle weight and drag acting against it.

18.1 Basic Launch Vehicle Considerations 721

Figure 18-1 shows the forces acting on a launch vehicle and the associated free-
body diagram. Note that the weight, W, of the vehicle acts at its center-of-gravity, cg,
and the aerodynamic forces—iift, L, and drag, D, act at its center-of-pressure, cp. This
configuration, with the center-of-gravity ahead of the center-of-pressure, is stable
since the lift and drag forces cause restoring torques about the vehicle’s center-of-
gravity. Ideally, thrust, 7, acts through the centerline of the vehicle but we can develop
a control torque by gimballing the engine nozzle. We measure the vehicle’s flight path
angle, @, from the local horizon to its velocity vector and we measure its angle-of-
attack, a, from its velocity vector to its centerline.

Free-body Diagram

Fig. 18-1. Forces Acting on a Launch Vehicle. By summing all the forces on a launch vehicle,
we can compute its acceleration and velocity, using Eqs. (18-1), (18-2), and an inte-
grating process.

Using the free-body diagram in Fig. 18-1, we can develop expressions for the
acceleration along the axial, a,, and lateral, a,, body reference axes.

a, = g [T/W - sin(¢ + @) - D/W cos(@) + L/W sin(a)] (18-1)
a, = g [-cos(¢ + a) + D/W sin(a) + L/W cos(a)] (18-2)

We use Eqs. (18-1) and (18-2) to develop the vehicle’s estimated acceleration shown
in Table 18-8. We can calculate thrust and drag using Eqs. (17-1) and (6-21), respec-
tively, and integrating Eqs. (18-1) and (18-2) in an inertial reference frame to yield the
estimated velocity of the launch vehicle.

We can easily estimate the velocity that a launch vehicle should provide by

MWiaesign = AViurnout + We ravity + AVarag (18-3)

where AVp,nour iS the velocity required for the desired orbit. We add the velocity
losses, AVpravity and AVgrag, to the burnout velocity to obtain the required design
velocity. We also have to account for velocity losses from thrust vector control for
trajectory shaping and other performance variables, such as solid rocket motor bulk

722 Launch Systems 18.1

temperature, which causes thrust-level variations. Fig. 18-2 shows values for gravity
and drag losses for a typical two-stage vehicle. Note that these losses are sensitive to
the initial thrust-to-weight ratio, 7/Wp. A low thrust-to-weight ratio causes gravity
losses to be high because the vehicle spends more time in ascent, while high thrust-to-
weight causes drag losses to be high because of the higher velocities achieved in the
atmosphere. The thrust-to-weight ratio is a key launch vehicle parameter because it
dictates the vibration, acoustic, and dynamic load environment for the spacecraft.
These environments are discussed in Sec. 18.3.

Velocity Losses

Fig. 18-2. Launch System Performance Losses. At the low end of T/W, gravity losses are
higher because the launch vehicle spends more time ascending. At the high end of
T/ Wo, drag losses are higher because the launch vehicle reaches a higher velocity in
the atmosphere.

If there were no atmosphere and no topographical variations, an optimum launch
trajectory would be very similar to a Hohmann transfer and gravity losses would be
minimized by thrusting normal to the radius vector. To accurately estimate gravity
losses we need to know a precise ascent profile and time of flight. But for medium-to-
large launch vehicles on nominal trajectories the velocity losses due to gravity fall
between 750 and 1,500 m/s.

Aerodynamic drag forces acting on a launch vehicle are a function of the shape and
size of the vehicle, speed, and angle-of-attack, @. We can manipulate Eq. (6-21) to get

D/W = C, (A/W) q (18-4)

where C, is the dimensionless coefficient of drag (about 2.2), A is the vehicle’s cross-
sectional area perpendicular to its velocity vector, and the dynamic pressure, q, is
one-half the product of the atmospheric density (at the vehicle’s current altitude) and
the velocity squared. For the current inventory of large, expendable launch vehicles,
velocity losses due to drag are less than 3% of the total change in velocity required,
about 20 to 40 m/s. The percentage decreases as the size of the vehicle decreases.
Once we know the required design velocity, AViesign , from mission requirements,
we can estimate the mass of propellant required for the launch vehicle using Eq. (17-7)
for single stage rockets and Sec. 17.5 for launch systems with multiple stages.
Several definitions are useful at this point. The flight vehicle mass is the sum of the
propellant mass, structure mass, including mass of the fairing, and the mass of every-

18.2 Launch System Selection Process 723

thing above the launch vehicle interface, including mass of the spacecraft bus,
payload, and any upper stages. We use mass fractions to describe the portion of the
flight vehicle devoted to certain sections. For example, the propellant mass fraction is
the mass of propellant divided by the total flight vehicle mass; the structure mass
fraction or deadweight fraction is the structural mass, including the mass of the fairing,
divided by total flight vehicle mass; and the payload mass fraction is the payload mass
divided by total flight vehicle mass. Typical values for propellant, structure, and
payload mass fractions are 0.85, 0.14, and 0.01, respectively.

18.2 Launch System Selection Process

The first step in the launch system selection process is to establish the mission
needs and objectives, since they dictate the performance, trajectory, and the family of
vehicles which can operate from suitable sites. The mission need should be stated in
terms of the specific return desired, e.g., Earth observation data over specific portions
of the Earth, weather information, etc. The mission need may be very specific as in the
case of a military objective, or as broad as a Presidential Directive to land man on the
Moon within a decade. A clear understanding of the real mission need is extremely
important since it can dictate the launch strategy. For example, large constellations of
spacecraft may require periodic replenishment launches after the constellation is full.
At the same time, a tactical satellite may require launch on demand within weeks or
days. These drastically different requirements demand different performance from the
launch system and its supporting infrastructure.

Another critical issue is whether ‘the spacecraft will use a dedicated or shared
launch system. The dedicated system may cost more, but it lessens the chances that a
problem with another spacecraft will adversely affect the launch. Payload security
may also demand a dedicated launch. On the other hand, shared launches are usually
less expensive per spacecraft. Before deciding on a shared launch, we must consider
the interaction between payloads in the shroud. If we mount them serially, for
example, we must analyze the probability that the upper payload will not deploy
and thus interfere with the lower payload’s deployment. Examples of larger vehicles
that can launch multiple payloads are the Space Shuttle, several Ariane 4 variants,
Ariane 5, and Titan IV. We consider launching multiple spacecraft if their desired
orbital altitudes and inclinations are compatible. This works especially well for the
Space Shuttle, when primary mission payloads don’t fill the payload bay, or when the
spacecraft are deployable and sortie operations has room on the mission timelines.

Once we establish the mission need, then we determine specific mission require-
ments. For low-Earth orbit missions, these usually consist of orbit altitude, inclination,
and right ascension of the ascending node. In addition, estimated payload weight and
dimensions become requirements to the launch system. The mission concept specifies
such parameters as number of spacecraft, anticipated lifetime and replacement strat-
egy, and method of data retrieval and management. A required launch date also may
become a selection parameter as it affects schedules, and the vehicle and launch site
availabilities.

We allocate the mission requirements as functional requirements between the
launch vehicle and payload. The basic question is, “What specific functions or opera-
tions must the payload accomplish, and which must the launch vehicle perform?” The
two functions usually affected are propulsion, and guidance, navigation, and control.
For example, can the launch vehicle achieve the final orbit, or must the spacecraft
provide orbital maneuvering capability to raise the orbit to a higher altitude or change

724 Launch Systems 18.2

inclination? The launch vehicle may require an upper stage to achieve the final orbit,
adding to the launch cost. The alternative is to provide sufficient propulsive capability
on the spacecraft to perform the final propulsive maneuvers. We must carefully weigh
the impact to the spacecraft in additional propellant and tankage, in terms of cost and
complexity to the spacecraft design and trade against the potentially higher launch cost
associated with an upper stage.

A similar trade is made in navigation, guidance, and control (Chap. 11.7). Space-
craft computer capabilities have grown by orders of magnitude over the past twenty
years. Consequently, the spacecraft navigation, guidance and control subsystem can
technically provide this function to the launch system during ascent. However, this
approach results in a highly coupled payload and launch system which presents some
negative attributes, including a more complex integration of the two, and makes it
more difficult to manage at the spacecraft-to-launch-vehicle interface. The current
trend is to separate the spacecraft and launch system functions at the interface, both
functionally and physically, to minimize interface requirements and complexity.

We must assess each function required to achieve the mission objective through
this process, and allocate functions based on cost, reliability, and risk. This is a classic
systems engineering problem, which we must continuously evaluate as part of the
vehicle selection process and as the spacecraft design matures.

Having established mission requirements, constraints, and the required information
in Step 1 of Table 18-1, we must decide which launch-system configurations can
deliver the spacecraft to its mission orbit. The launch systems selected during concep-
tual design should satisfy the mission’s performance requirements and minimize
program risk. We want to choose the launch systems early, so contractors for the
spacecraft and launch system can negotiate requirements early, as well. Doing so
decreases changes in design, cost, and schedule downstream. Recent experiences
show that we should design spacecraft to be compatible with several launch systems
to enhance launch probability, as well as to provide some leverage in negotiating
launch cost. Fixing problems that may cause launches to fail takes months or years. If
we change the launcher we may have to redesign the spacecraft and its interfaces with
the launch vehicle. A redesign costs a lot of time and money. To solve this problem,
we select an alternate launch vehicle, as a backup, early in the process, and design the
spacecraft to be compatible with both.

Selecting a launch system depends on at least these criteria: the launch vehicle’s
performance capability to boost the necessary weight to the mission orbit, the
required launch date versus vehicle availability, spacecraft-to-launch-vehicle com-
patibility, and of course, cost of the launch service. The launch system’s performance
capability must include factors such as performance margin, and a clear definition of
weight and performance parameters as given in Table 18-2. Note that the payload
performance quoted by launch vehicle manufacturers must be greater than the pro-
jected boosted weight. This difference (launch system performance capability minus
spacecraft boosted weight) is referred to as performance margin and is an important
selection criterion. Note that the performance margin is in addition to the allowances
made for spacecraft weight growth (see Table 10-9).

Performance margin is an important parameter throughout a program, but it is
particularly important early in a program. Ideally a spacecraft launches with a small
positive performance margin, meaning that the spacecraft weighs (when it is com-
pleted and delivered) just what the launch system can place into orbit. For spacecraft
with propulsion systems, we use propellant loading to trim the final weight.

This is the payload weight contractors say their launch
systems can lift

Occasionally this happens, but more often the spacecraft’s weight grows beyond
projected weight growth allocations. Make sure the spacecraft weight is within the
launcher capability and that the weight growth is within the allocated weight growth
margin (see Table 10-10). The longer the wait to reduce weight, the more it costs. Do
it early!

If the launch system does not have sufficient performance capability, discussions
with the launch vehicle manufacturer can frequently result in some augmentation to
the performance, selection of a higher performance launch system, or, if necessary,
reevaluation of the spacecraft design and its requirements. These trades are part of the
selection process whereby we continuously reevaluate cost, schedule, and risk.

We further evaluate the candidate launch systems which pass the performance
“gate” based on their available payload fairings. The fairings must be physically large
enough to house and protect the spacecraft during ascent, and the interfaces to the
spacecraft, both structural attachment and other services such as cooling (see
Sec. 18.3), must be acceptable to the spacecraft.

We must also consider the launch schedule and whether the preferred launch
system will be available. Given the required launch date and window, we discuss
availability with contractors of launch services. Schedule considerations should
include the launch site’s availability as well as the use of any unique facilities for
ground processing. For example, on the requested launch date, the launch pad may be
available but activities nearby may keep us from launching for safety or security
reasons. Thus, we have to examine the entire infrastructure, including items such as
ground-support equipment and networks for tracking and communications. Several
off-site facilities are available for processing—commercially and through agreements

726 Launch Systems 18.2

with government agencies. Finally, if we intend to change the launch site, we must
consider the effect on scheduling and cost.

Launch availability brings other dimensions to launch-system selection. The avail-
ability of a launch system depends on its reliability, production capacity, the ability of
the launch operations system to support the desired launch rate, existing launch com-
mitments, and its demonstrated stand-down time following a failure. The relationship

A=1-[L0 —-R)T,/0 — 1/S)] (18-5)

allows us to discuss this concept. Here the expected launch availability, A, measured
in percent of the time the launch system is available, depends on the vehicle’s reli-
ability, R, the nominal or planned launch rate, L, in units of flights per year, the
demonstrated (or estimated) stand-down time following a failure, T,,, in units of years,
and the surge-rate capacity, S, where S = 1.5 means the system can achieve a flight
rate 50% higher than the planned rate L. Launch systems in the United States can
typically surge to between 1.15 and 1.5 times the nominal launch rate. Figure 18-3
illustrates results from Eq. (18-5). Negative results mean that the system probably
would not be available when needed. We must use Eq. (18-5) with caution since a
singularity occurs for surge values approaching one, i.e., the system has no surge
capacity. Commitment to two systems with poor availability means that some of the
spacecraft so committed will not fly or may be delayed for several years. Table 18-3
provides estimated reliability and stand-down times for typical launch systems.

Fig. 18-3. Vehicle Availability. Even with a high surge capability (1.4), a launch system may
have low availability (0.43) for a modest launch rate (4 per year) and a high reliability
(0.96). For a high launch rate (8 per year), the same system may not be available
when needed.

Availability (%)

Using the above criteria, we can narrow the field of candidates to a few launch
systems by evaluating them consistently and systematically. A risk analysis must also
accompany these assessments by considering:

¢ Are the advertised cost and schedules reasonable?

* How do these numbers compare with past experience?

* Is the offeror likely to stay in business? Or in some cases, is the country
providing the launch service stable?

« Are there any circumstances which are unique or new that could result in
additional risk?

These are difficult questions to address, but a successful mission is predicated on care-
ful consideration of these factors.

To identify the best combinations, we should examine several acceptable deploy-
ment strategies and staging concepts. There are three primary options for the ascent
from Earth to the final mission orbit: direct injection by a launch system, injection
using various launch and stage vehicle combinations, or injection using an integral
propulsion system. Small payloads can usually use launch vehicles that insert directly
into low-Earth orbit. For geostationary orbits, however, we typically need to augment
the launch vehicle with an upper stage. The third method, integral propulsion, allows
us to insert and maintain the spacecraft in its orbit and control its attitude with a single
propellant system in the spacecraft. Because the system must operate for the entire
mission with many restarts, it typically uses a liquid bipropellant or an ion engine.

Table 18-4 lists available launch systems, their ability to launch the boosted weight,
compatible upper stages, available launch sites, and envelope dimensions for standard
payload fairings. For more precise information on these systerns, see the user manuals,
listed just before the references at the end of this chapter. Figures 18-4 and 18-5 show
performance curves for selected launch vehicles at various altitudes. Although options
seem endless, usually only a few candidate systems meet requirements of payload
weight injected into the desired orbit, weight margin, vehicle availability, cost, and
reliability. In addition, Table 18-5 lists available stage vehicles and their performance.
Tables 17-6 and 17-7 list typical solid rocket motors and liquid engines, respectively.

The current version of the Delta launch system, Delta II, has two forms: the 6925
and 7925. The 6925 extended the earlier 3920’s tanks to store more propellant and
added Thiokol solid-rocket boosters for better performance. The 7925 uses an
upgraded Rocketdyne RS-27A main engine and Hercules GEM solid rocket boosters.
The 6920 and 7920 are two-stage versions of the three-stage 6925 and 7925, respec-
tively. Both core vehicles use liquid oxygen and RP-1 propellant in the first stage and
nitrogen tetroxide (N»O,) and Aerozine 50 (A50) in the second stage. They use inertial
guidance and provide control moments from gimballed engines. Of the nine boosters,

18.2 Launch System Selection Process 731

six ignite at lift-off and stage at 57 sec. The other three ignite at altitude during the first
stage burn. The first and second stages are staged at 265 and 440 sec respectively. The
third stage uses a spin-stabilized Star 48 B rocket motor in the PAM-D upper stage.
Atlas/Centaur launch vehicles include the Atlas I, Atlas II, Atlas IIA, and Atlas
IIAS. The Atlas vehicle’s core system uses liquid oxygen and hydrocarbons (RP-1) in
a stage-and-a-half form, with three engines ignited at lift-off. Two of these booster
engines jettison at 172 sec, and the third sustainer engine burns for another 111 sec.
The Atlas is inertially guided and controlled in pitch and yaw by gimballed engines.
Vernier engines on Atlas I control roll in the first stage. For Atlas II, ITA, and ITAS, a
hydrazine roll control system attached to the interstage adapter controls the roll angle.
The Centaur uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for propulsion. It has two
RL-10A engines, which can start several times and burn 400 to 600 sec. Gimballed
engines control the Centaur during burn, and 12 reaction-control engines control it
when it coasts. On the IIAS version, four solid rocket motors improve the lifting
capacity. Two motors ignite with the three main engines for lift off. When the first two
motors burn out they drop off, then the other two burn until depleted and drop off.

The Titan IT is a refurbished ballistic missile configured as a launch vehicle. It was
essentially the core vehicle for the retired Titan II series. For fuel, the Titan II uses
storable propellants: a nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer and Aerozine 50 (a 50/50 mixture of
hydrazine and UDMH). Adding two solid rocket boosters and a third stage for the
Titan III vehicle increased lift capability significantly. Fifty-five Titan II missiles were
available to modify, eleven of which completed modification and launched success-
fully, as of late 1998. The Titan IV vehicle adds solid rockets to the Titan core vehicle.
The solid rockets are the “zero” stage ignited for lift-off, whereas the core vehicle’s
engines ignite when the solid-rocket motor’s thrust tails off before separating. The
Titan IV zero stage burns 138 sec, the first stage 164 sec, and the second stage 223 sec.
A strap-down inertial system provides guidance using liquid injection (UDMH) to
contro] the thrust vector in the zero stage and gimballed engines for the first and sec-
ond stages. Titan IV is compatible with two upperstages, TUS and Centaur.

The Space Shuttle delivers, services, and recovers payloads. The Shuttle uses two
solid-rocket boosters and three liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen engines for propul-
sion. The solid-rocket boosters burn out at approximately 123 sec. At first, the main
engines burn in parallel with the solids, then continue to burn for 522 sec. For each
flight, the Shuttle can carry up to three PAM-D payloads, one IUS, or one TOS.

The Pegasus air-launched booster and its -XL variant use wings to provide lift and
three stages powered by solid-rocket motors. A strapped-down inertial system guides
the booster. Aerodynamic fins control the first stage, and vectorable nozzles control
the second and third stages. A cold-gas system for reaction control adjusts attitude
while the spacecraft coasts and when the payload deploys and separates. Employing a
Lockheed L-1011 as a launch platform reduces the propellant needed to achieve orbit
and provides variable launch azimuths and locations for different orbital inclinations.

Space Data Corporation, a subsidiary of the Orbital Sciences Corporation, devel-
oped a standard, smal] launch vehicle called Taurus. The first stage is essentially an
MX missile first stage, and the upper stages are similar to those flown on Pegasus,
without the attached wing. Two successful launches in 1998 placed seven satellites
into low-Earth orbit.

Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International offers Proton for commercial
launches. The original Russian D-le version has four stages and delivers payloads to
geostationary orbits. The first three stages use storable propellants (UDMH and N,0,),

732 Launch Systems 18.2

but the upper stage burns liquid oxygen and kerosene and has a multiple start capabil-
ity. It has supported planetary and lunar launches and placed communication satellites
in space. The 3-stage D-1 launches the MIR and other large payloads into low-Earth
orbits. The new commercial K and M versions use the same first three stages, but add
the DM and Breeze M upperstages, respectively.

China’s Great Wall Industries builds, offers commercially, and operates the Long
March vehicles. The Long March CZ3 is a three-stage vehicle, using storable propel-
lants in the first two stages and cryogenic liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen in the
third stage. A new heavy-lift variant, the CZ3B, uses four liquid strap-ons and can
carry 13,600 kg into low-Earth orbit.

The current versions of the Ariane launch system are the Ariane 4 and 5 series.
Arianespace operates these vehicles commercially. Ariane 4 is a three-stage vehicle
capable of using from zero to four strap-on solid or liquid rocket boosters. The liquid
strap-ons and stages one and two use storable nitrogen tetroxide and UH-25 (a mixture
of 75% unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine and 25% hydrazine hydrate). The third
stage burns liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Ariane 5 is a new, heavy-lift vehicle,
designed for reliability and cost effectiveness. It has a core stage that uses liquid
hydrogen and oxygen, an upper stage that burns nitrogen tetroxide and monomethy]
hydrazine, and two solid-rocket-motor strap-ons that are recoverable. Eventually,
Arianespace will rate this vehicle for crewed launches. It has had two successful
launches after an initial launch failure. Ariane launch vehicles are efficient boosters
for low-inclination or geotransfer missions because of their Kourou launch site: just
5 deg north latitude. As a result of the location and launch successes, they have
captured more than half of the launch traffic for commercial communication satellites.

Japan’s space agencies operate two launch systems and are designing a third. The
H-2 is a new heavy-lift vehicle that can place 10,500 kg into low-Earth orbit. This two-
stage vehicle burns liquid hydrogen and oxygen in both stages and has two solid-
rocket-motor strap-ons. Launching from Tanegashima Space Center, it has six
successes in six attempts. The M-5 is a new three-stage vehicle, capable of launching
1,800 kg into low-Earth orbit. All stages use solid rocket motors, burning hydroxy-ter-
minated polybutadiene (HTPB). This vehicle operates from the Kagoshima Space
Center and has two successes in two attempts. A new design, J-1, uses the H-2 solid
rocket booster as stage one and the two upper stages from the M-3SII as its upper
stages. Because of these common parts, its design went quickly.

Table 18-6 lists the available launch sites for each launch system. Once we have
identified the mission orbit and launch system, the appropriate launch site(s) become
apparent. The key U.S. launch sites are the Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force
Station, Florida, which serves the Kennedy Space Center next to it, and the Western
Range at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. The Wallops Island facility in
Virginia can launch a number of smaller commercial launch vehicles and sounding
rockets.

Figure 18-6 shows the location of the world’s launch sites, and Table 18-6 identifies
their coordinates. We can get the best performance from a launch vehicle into a direct
orbit by locating the launch site at the equator to take advantage of the easterly velocity
from Earth’s rotation. Theoretically, we can attain any orbit inclination from the equa-
tor, but we may select other sites for convenient access, security, or political reasons.
Launch sites at higher latitudes cannot directly access orbit inclinations much below
their latitude, and trajectory profiles that go to higher inclinations sacrifice velocity
and payload mass. An inclination change of one degree requires about 208 m/s of

18.2 Launch System Selection Process 733

velocity in low-Earth orbit. As Eq. (6-38) shows, this number decreases as the altitude
of the change increases. We can calculate the propellant mass required to achieve the
plane change using Eq. (17-7).

Section 6.4 discussed the relationship between the desired orbital inclination and
the required direction of launch from a specific launch site. The direction of launch, or
launch azimuth, depends on range safety considerations that prohibit flying over
certain land and ocean areas. Figure 18-7 shows the launch azimuths and inclina-
tions directly available from the U.S. Eastern and Western launch sites. The Japanese
have only two 45-day launch periods, one in the spring and one in the winter. At other
times, the launch would threaten fishing fleets by dropping booster parts into the
fishing area.

Fig. 18-7. Orbit inclinations and Launch Azimuths Available from the Eastern and Western
Ranges. In general, low-inclination orbits are possible from the East coast and high-
inclination orbits are possible from the West. Note that orbital inclinations available
from these launch sites depend on launch azimuth.

Given a choice of launch sites and launch dates, we must consider weather at the
launch location. Bad weather can severely restrict chances to launch, thus costing time
and money. The site’s location and time of year determine surface weather and winds
aloft. For example, Florida and French Guiana have many thunderstorms and fre-
quent lightning during the spring and summer. Because the highly ionized gas in the
launcher’s exhaust plume can attract lightning, we must launch carefully in these sea-
sons. During the winter, the winds aloft are severe because the jet stream moves to the
south and often passes over both the Eastern and Western Ranges. As a result, we must
study weather information for all possible sites.

Although only a few launch-system vendors operate in the U.S., we can choose
intelligently from many types of launch vehicles. Several government organizations
manage these systems. The Air Force Space Systems Division (AFSSD) developed the
Titan, Atlas, and Delta launchers and matches launchers to users’ requests. Air Force
Space Command manages launch operations at DoD launch sites. NASA manages the
Space Transportation System through NASA Headquarters. Vendors of commercial
launch vehicles contract services directly with users. Contractors obtain license
approvals to launch through the Department of Transportation, Office of Commercial
Space Transportation.

18.3 Determining the Spacecraft Design
Envelope and Environments

Once we’ ve identified several launch systems for our mission, we must determine
the configuration of the interfaces between the launch system and payload and under-
stand the environments that the payload must withstand. We can use the parameters
for the launch system we select; however, a preferred approach is to match environ-
ments and interfaces to the combined parameters of several launch vehicles. We
should at least develop the information listed in Step 4 of Table 18-1. This process is
referred to as payload integration, which means doing the management, program sup-
port, and analysis required to integrate the spacecraft (including upper stages) with the
launch vehicle. We must consider this step early in mission design. The payload design
must address launch environments and interfaces, whereas the launch system must
support the payload during ascent. If we don’t integrate these tasks carefully, problems
in designing and manufacturing the payload can scuttle or seriously delay the launch.
Payload integration must meet specific requirements of the program review, including
interface control documents at both the Flight Feasibility Review and the Cargo Inte-
gration Review.

In the spacecraft design, we must consider the payload environment for the time the
payload leaves the vendor’s facility until the spacecraft completes its mission. In this
section, we will address the environment from the time we install the payload on top
of the launch vehicle until it’s through the ascent. In many areas, the combination of
high accelerations and vibrations coupled with the thermal environment and rapidly
changing local pressures result in environmental conditions more severe than it would
experience on orbit. Carefully considering these environments is critical to spacecraft
design. Three areas require particular attention: usable payload volume offered by the
available fairings, structural and electrical interfaces, and payload environments, as
summarized in Table 18-7.

Fairings. Launch-vehicle vendors offer a wide range of payload fairings. They
define the usable payload volumes and dimensions within the fairings for the space-
craft. These values account for payload and fairing deflections due to static and
dynamic loads encountered during ascent. Table 18-4 provides approximate dimen-
sions for various systems, and Fig. 18-8 shows a typical payload fairing.

The mission designer must ensure that the spacecraft will fit within the allowable
envelope. The fairing protects the payload from aerodynamic loads and, in general,
provides a benign environment, as discussed below, to lessen the impact on the
payload. Generally the payload fairing is jettisoned late in the ascent when dynamic
pressure and the heating rate are below acceptable levels specified by the launch vehi-
cle vendor. Different times can be negotiated, if required. We do not need to analyze
payload and upper-stage combinations which are similar to previously flown payloads
as extensively as new or unique payloads, because analysis by similarity is acceptable.
If available fairings are unsuitable, launch vehicle vendors can develop fairings to
meet unique requirements.

The Space Shuttle’s cargo bay is so large that it usually accommodates several pay-
loads. To help planning, the bay is partitioned into four sectors, allocating a specified
amount of electrical power, cooling, telemetry, and so forth, to each—comparable to
that available from a Delta or Atlas vehicle. Larger payloads combine resources from
several sectors to meet their requirements. The cargo bay doors and the fuselage
provide protection equivalent to that of a shroud on an expendable launch vehicle.

Structural and Electrical Interfaces. We must identify interfaces between the
payload and the launch system early in the design process. For example, a payload
adapter attaches the payload to the launch vehicle, and we have to determine whether
the payload needs additional support. The adapters physically connect the payload and
any required kick motors, spin tables, separation systems, or electrical interfaces. The
launch-vehicle manufacturer usually provides them, if necessary, tailoring them to
individual requirements. Adapter mass reduces available payload mass, so it is some-
times an important part of selecting the launch vehicle. Examples of booster-adapter
masses are the 51-kg single-launch Type 1666A adapter for the Ariane 4, and, for
dual-launch systems, the 440-kg Long SPELDA, also for Ariane. Section 11.6
provides a method to estimate booster-adapter weight, but actual weights are in the
launch vehicle users’ guide.

Launch-vehicle manufacturers must provide physical, electrical, radio frequency,
and optical access to the payload while the fairing encloses it. Effective operations
demand the correct location of access doors and windows for radio frequencies and
optics. In many cases, manufacturers must wire the launcher to command and safe the
spacecraft. They also provide the mechanisms that separate the payload from the
launch vehicle in orbit, typically by using redundant logic and circuitry to trigger
redundant, ordnance-firing systems. High reliability in the payload separation mecha-
nism is important.

The launch system and payload must match the desired communications architec-
ture for launch operations. Communications requirements depend on the combined
demands of the entire space mission: ground stations, payload, launch vehicle, range
safety, and the user. We can adjust launch trajectories somewhat to provide redundant
ground-station coverage during launch if needed. When we cannot get ground
coverage, aircraft can cover critical events. We must check the entire communications

architecture before launch if we expect the launch and early orbit operations to
succeed. Chapter 13 discusses communications networks in more detail.

Payload Environments. We need to pay attention to the predicted payload
environments so we can protect the payload during ground transportation, aircraft
take-off and landing, hoisting operations, launch, and ascent. Table 18-7 lists the
payload environments that we should assess for pre-launch and launch. The supply of
conditioned air to the payload fairing controls the pre-launch thermal environment.
Conditioned air typically moves through ducts into the top of the fairing, while vents
near the fairing bottom maintain acceptable pressures and temperatures. Specifications
normally call for static pressures of about 79 millibars, a temperature range of 9 to
37 °C, relative humidity of 30% to 50%, and air filtration to class 10,000.

738 Launch Systems 18.3

Contamination degrades the performance of solar panels, optical sensors, and
surfaces used for thermal control. Where necessary, we need to control the handling
of particles and molecules from the launcher’s out-gassing materials. To model how
contaminants move from source to removal, we analyze the thermal characteristics,
compartment airflow, outgassing properties of materials, qualities and location of
materials, and spacecraft components. We have to consider these analyses from
ground processing through ascent.

Electrical signals must be compatible among the spacecraft bus, the payload, the
launch vehicle, and the launch site. Electrical signals of different frequencies and
powers can combine to form spurious radio transmissions and electric fields that spoof
systems or fire ordnance devices. Shielding and design of ordnance circuits must
conform to safety regulations at the launch site. For after lift-off, the launch-vehicle
operator defines, documents, and integrates the flight electrical environment. The
payload developer’s analysis ensures that the spacecraft is compatible with these
ascent conditions.

The following analyses of ascent environments concentrate on discrete events
where flight experience shows the environment may drive the design. These design
points include ignition and shutdown events, and periods of maximum dynamic pres-
sure, maximum acceleration, peak heating rates, and heat loading.

Several analyses help us define and control the thermal environment for payloads
during ascent. For expendable launch vehicles, we assess the thermal effects due to the
radiant heat from the payload fairing internal surfaces. Maximum temperatures on the
inner wall of a Delta-II vehicle range from 25 to 50° C. We also check radiated heat
from the payload fairing or doors and free-molecular heating from rarefied air hitting
the spacecraft after the payload fairing is jettisoned. When we use an upper stage, we
have to consider the thermal effects from being exposed to the space environment
during the parking and transfer-orbit phases. The Shuttle flights require similar analy-
ses. We must consider any extended time the payload is aboard the Orbiter and the
standard abort scenarios. We review results from these analyses to chart effects on
mission operations and to constrain the time that the payload is exposed to the Sun or
deep space while in the Orbiter bay.

Several static and dynamic loads affect the structures of the payload, adapters, and
launch vehicle. These loads are either aerodynamic or they depend on acceleration and
vibration. Aerodynamic loads are a function of the total pressure placed on the vehicle
moving through the atmosphere. They consist of a static (ambient) pressure and a
dynamic pressure (the pressure component experienced by a fluid when brought to
rest). The relationship between altitude and velocity on the ascent trajectory deter-
mines these pressures. Payload fairings protect against dynamic pressure up to stated
limits. (If strong winds on launch day result in excessive shear loads, the launch must
be postponed.) At some point in the ascent trajectory the dynamic pressure will drop
to levels which will not damage an unprotected payload; this results from the atmo-
spheric density decreasing with altitude. At this point the fairing may be jettisoned to
lighten the load on the booster. Typically payload fairings are not jettisoned until the
dynamic pressure drops to 0.5 N/mz2.

During ascent a pressure differential occurs between the inside and outside of the
fairing because the ambient atmospheric pressure continuously drops with altitude
while the fairing contains higher-pressure air. Air trapped in compartments and crev-
ices within the fairing and the spacecraft is at a higher pressure until the fairing vents
to the outside. The venting rate depends on the pressure differential between internal

18.3 Determining the Spacecraft Design Envelope and Environments 739

payload compartments and the fairing, as well as the pressure differential between the
volume enclosed within the fairing and the external environment. The venting rate also
depends on the size and number of vent ports, on the spacecraft and on the fairing.
Figure 18-9 gives typical data on pressure differentials (pressure inside the fairing
minus external ambient pressure) for the Titan-IJI. Some values are ranges which
cover trajectory dispersions and uncertainties in the venting rates. We may need to
vent payload components to prevent damage during ascent.

Fig. 18-9. Pressure Differential in the Payload Compartment for Titan-lll. This chart shows
the payload compartment's pressure relative to ambient air pressure during ascent.
We must know this differential pressure to vent pressure adequately.

The acceleration loads, usually called load factors, experienced by the payload
consist of static (steady state) and dynamic (vibration) loads. Table 18-8 shows typical
values for several launch vehicles, measured in terms of g levels or multiples of sea-
level, gravitational acceleration (9.806 65 m/s). Note that we must consider axial and
lateral values. In addition to the normal ascent-acceleration and vibrational-load
events, Shuttle payloads must look at events on orbit, during re-entry, and during
emergency or nominal landings. Figure 18-10 shows the vibrational environments for
several launch systems. These environments consist of launch-vehicle acceleration,
variable combustion flows in the engines, aerodynamic drag and shear, acoustic
pressures from the engines, and the mechanical response of the entire vehicle to these
stimuli. We must design the payload and booster adapter to carry these loads.
Table 18-9 specifies a lower limit for the fundamental frequency of the booster adapter
and spacecraft combination, resulting in a structural stiffness requirement. However,
if the combination is too stiff, the structure may interfere with the most energetic
vibration frequencies shown in Fig. 18-10. Thus, we need to update analyses of static
and dynamic loads, so they include more refined data on the design of the launch
system, booster adapter, and payload.

To separate the launch vehicle from the spacecraft, or to deploy spacecraft compo-
nents, we typically use pyrotechnic devices. These devices are light, highly reliable,
and easily integrated into mating techniques that provide a high degree of stiffness.
Unfortunately, when activated they generate a shock load that transmits through the
structure to the payload. Figure 18-11 shows the shock characteristics for several
launch systems.

Fig. 18-11. Shock Environments for Launch Systems Caused by Staging and Separation

The acoustic environment is a function of the physical configuration of the launch
vehicle, its acceleration time history, and the configuration of the propulsion system.
The near-launch-pad acoustic environment depends on the reflected sound energy
from the launch pad ‘structures and facilities. The maximum dynamic environment
is a consequence of the rate of acceleration and the aerodynamic smoothness of
the launch vehicle shape. Solid-rocket boosters and first stages (often combined) usu-
ally provoke a more severe environment, and the smaller the launch vehicle,
the more stressed the payload. In general, the closer the payload is to the launch pad,
the more severe the acoustic environment prior to releasing the launch vehicle, and the
more rapidly the vehicle accelerates, the more severe the environment at maximum
dynamic pressure. Since the acoustic excitation is rapidly time-varying, we must
design for the instantaneous values and the overall average. When the payload design
is sensitive to the acoustic environment, it is common to add damping insulation to the
fairing. Figure 18-12 shows the acoustic environments of several launch vehicles.

mum energy at two points: at ignition before release of hold-downs and at transition
through maximum dynamic pressure (Max q). Delta provides both a 2.9 and 3.2 m
standard shroud for which the acoustics are different. Often shrouds are made to
provide the desired environment.

Injection accuracy is also important to launch systems. Traditionally, the launch
system and payload separate at a prescribed location and velocity. Launch-system
vendors usually state an orbit-injection accuracy that depends primarily on the last
stage of the vehicle. Table 18-10 gives injection accuracies for several systems launch-
ing a payload to geosynchronous transfer orbit.

TABLE 18-10. Injection Accuracy for Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits. These numbers
depend on the last stage of the vehicle and type of guidance used. We may need
more propellant on the spacecraft to correct errors in inclination and altitude at
apogee.

Early in the design, we must consider payload processing and integration proce-
dures at the launch site. Commercial and government facilities are available for
processing payloads at various launch sites. The actual flow depends on specific
processing requirements, configuration of propulsion, ordnance elements, and avail-
able facilities. Payload processing includes receiving inspections, checking payload
and ground-support equipment, installing hardware such as batteries and avionics,
checking pressures and gas leaks, and testing functions and communications.

Potential integration functions at the launch site include mating the spacecraft with
a stage vehicle, spin tests, loading propellants, mating with the launch vehicle, and
prelaunch testing of all systems (integrated test). Two items to consider are the launch-
site layout and how to integrate the payload and launch vehicle. A launch site may
have several pads, so we can integrate several spacecraft at the same time. Others may
have one pad that restricts the flow to one payload at a time. If the launch site uses a
series approach, launch delays and failures in one spacecraft or launch system may
adversely impact the next program.

Various launch systems use vastly different approaches to physically integrate the
payload and the launch vehicle. The most common is vertical integration, which
means erecting the booster and hoisting the payload on top of it. With this method, we
must build platforms at various levels so we can get to the entire launch vehicle, stage
vehicle, and payload. This approach works, but it is fraught with restricted access and
safety problems. Another way is horizontal integration, which means securing the
launch vehicle in a horizontal position and attaching the spacecraft. This approach
eases access and lessens safety concerns. Actual payload processing varies according
to the complexity of the spacecraft, and should be examined case-by-case. The time
required at the launch site depends on its design, interface requirements, integrated test
requirements, amount of shared resources, and the launch-site operator’s philosophy
and approach.

Following the process defined in this chapter, you should be able to identify several
acceptable launch systems for a particular mission and establish preliminary design
requirements for the spacecraft. The process is an iterative one, and you will probably
need to use it several times prior to converging on the spacecraft design and launch
vehicle.
