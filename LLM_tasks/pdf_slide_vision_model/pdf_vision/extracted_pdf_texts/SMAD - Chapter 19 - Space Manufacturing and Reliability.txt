Historically, satellite manufacturing, integration, and test has been a crafted and
arduous process. Each spacecraft is essentially unique, and is manufactured and tested
appropriately. Commercial satellites, while alleviating some of the major impedances
to fast and efficient satellite manufacture, have fared only slightly better. The advent
of commercial constellations of satellites forces us to seek and develop completely
new strategies. We need to incorporate ideas and methods from other industries into
satellite supply-chains to meet the cost and cycle-time requirements needed to make
space systems compete effectively with their terrestrial counterparts.

This chapter describes a few of the vital changes that need to be addressed to man-
ufacture and test multiple satellites efficiently. These methods and strategies apply to
the whole satellite supply chain, and to piece-part, assembly, subsystem, and space-
craft levels. Chapter 12 detailed methods used to manufacture and test single satellites.
This chapter augments Chap. 12 for multiple satellite systems.

Small satellite systems (< 10 spacecraft) may not fully benefit from the methods
presented here, but some points will be applicable. Designing manufacturable satel-
lites and associated production systems requires up-front investments in time, money,
and capital. Each program needs to trade the benefits of these methods with anticipated
investment costs. As the number of satellites grows, the benefits and the usefulness of
these methods increases.

We begin with a short description of the goals and challenges of manufacturing,
material, test, and launch processing organizations. The majority of the chapter then
concentrates on four phases of the manufacturing and test of the spacecraft constella-
tion: (1) creating the manufacturing vision, (2) influencing the design, (3) developing
and verifying the process, and (4) producing the spacecraft.

19.1.1 Challenges for Manufacturing, Material, Test,
and Launch Processing Teams

The challenges presented to the manufacture of satellite constellations are
extremely different from those traditionally conceived for spacecraft. These chal-
lenges, however, are not much different from those for other commercial products.
Spacecraft are designed and built to cost and schedule goals—just like video recorders
or cars. Figure 19-1 compares a few of the challenges facing the manufacture of a
constellation of satellites, while Fig. 19-2 shows manufacturing issues as they pertain
to key metrics—quality, time, and cost.

Fig. 19-2. Constellation Manufacturing Issues. The quality, cycle time, and cost issue relating
to the production of a constellation of satellites are different than those encountered
while producing single satellites. While quality requirements are different—but still
stringent—cycle time and cost issues are now paramount.

For instance, time to market often is not only a goal, but a competitive requirement
for viability. Time becomes an overriding factor. This drives not only the overall time
to market, but the time to complete each system element. For manufacturing, this
translates to drastically reducing the cycle time required to produce a satellite.

Quality, as with all spacecraft, is still imperative. Satellites are not field serviceable,
and simple defects can render a satellite unusable. The traditional approach places
emphasis on high-cost and time-consuming quality assurance methods that check and
recheck, test and retest, and verify and reverify the hardware. Instead, we employ six-

19.1 Designing Space Systems for Manufacturability 747

sigma methods to verify that the processes are performing with high-quality results.
Robust designs using in-control processes will produce high-quality products—with-
out associated high costs and long cycle times. Six-sigma methods are a cornerstone
for lean and agile manufacturing methods (see sidebar).

To meet the additional cycle-time and quality requirements, manufacturing person-
ne] must participate concurrently during the creation of the design. They are responsi-
ble for influencing the design and tailoring the design into a final, producible product.
Finally, manufacturing must effectively integrate the product during production.

In summary, the challenges presented to manufacturing are to recreate the value-
added or useful elements of space hardware design and manufacture. We must elimi-
nate non-value-added activities. We must add elements for quick, efficient, and high
quality execution. We must drive out non-value-added or superfluous activities and
requirements.

The Six Sigma program began in Motorola in 1985 as a means to measure and. improve
performance in all phases of its business. The ultimate target is virtually perfect execution.

Sigma (6) is used to designate the distribution or spread about the mean or average of any
process or procedure. A simple definition of six sigma is 3.4 defects per million opportunities,
or 99.9997% perfect. Sigma level improvement is not linear. In fact, improvement rates
escalate rapidly as the base sigma level slowly increases.

Six Sigma methodologies are a set of tools and procedures to improve processes. Funda-
mental methods include problem solving, process control and process characterization. They
can be applied to any process from engineering to business. For more information, reference
Harry [1997] or Harry and Lawson [1997].

Material Challenges

Traditional manufacturing drove spacecraft parts to the costliest and slowest-
delivery grade—S-level. Unfortunately, these parts are not inherently better than com-
mercial parts—they have just been screened for various properties to improve their
overall expected performance or failure rates. The parts are mostly produced on
commercial part lines and even from commercial part batches.

Our challenge is to use the right parts for the mission—not the highest level parts
available. We need to target commercial parts, replacing them only when required. We
need to discourage military grade or S-level parts, but allow them in situations where
they must be used. A simple comparison of part costs, as shown in Fig.19-3, depicts
the drastic difference for S-level, Mil-spec, and commercial parts. Significant cost
savings can result from selecting lower-cost parts when applicable. As discussed in
Sec. 12.2, significant time savings also can result from selecting lower grade parts.
This yields a significant advantage of using Mil-spec parts over S-level parts. Further-
ing this comparison, we can receive commercial parts typically even quicker—often
in less than a week.

Parts selection needs to consider producibility, radiation, out-gassing, and other
requirements. We need to consider strongly parts that support efficient manufacturing
methods. We should target parts that use the standard process flows—-for instance,
automated placement and mass reflow for electronic assemblies.

Finally, parts selection needs to be a value-added concurrent engineering activity.
Success in the material area heavily influences overall program cost and schedule
performance.

cost savings over Mil-spec and S-level parts.

Test Challenges

The test function drives the overall cycle time of spacecraft delivery. This holds
true not only for traditional satellites, but for constellations as well. The key is to
design test as a process—this includes minimizing cycle time, maximizing throughput,
and achieving high-quality results.

The purpose of the overall test program is to verify the adequacy of the design and
assembly processes. The requirements to verify these two elements—design and pro-
cesses—are inherently different.

Design verification, more commonly called qualification testing, requires detailed
and thorough analysis of performance capabilities. This still is a time-consuming
process that includes functional test, vibration and shock, thermal vacuum, electro-
magnetic compatibility, and other tests. This may include multiple iterations, and
essentially involves testing the satellite to greater than expected levels. We should cut
back and ultimately eliminate these qualification tests after we understand and proof
the design. We can achieve significant savings in time and money by relinquishing the
need for full-up testing on every unit.

Conversely, process verification continues throughout the production of the
spacecraft. These tests only verify the performance of the production system and
include only simple performance checks. The control of the individual processes
throughout the production cycle ensures the high-quality results. Complete testing of
the spacecraft would be redundant and non-value added—and not consistent with the
principles of lean production. Figure 19-4 shows some key differences between tradi-
tional spacecraft production and lean production.

In regards to components, subassemblies, and subsystems, it is critical that they
achieve their qualification testing and product testing as early as possible. We need to
detect quickly issues with design or process. We can integrate high quality and well-
understood components, subassemblies, and subsystems with no additional integra-
tion level testing—-with high confidence. At integration, we need to verify only
incremental processing—usually only shipping and connection.

Lean production methods originated in the automobile industry. These methods can
be applied to the production of satellites as well. See Womack et al. [1990] for in depth
discussion of lean manufacturing.

In summary, test provides possibly the greatest opportunity for significant cost and
cycle-time improvements. Intelligent selection of reduced testing, clear distinction
between design and process verification, and performance of lowest-level testing
greatly enhances the cost-effective, high quality, low cycle-time production of space-
craft without significantly increasing risk.

Launch Processing Challenges

After finishing integration and test, we package and ship the satellites to the launch
site for processing and preparation for launch. Traditionally, this has been a complex
and time-consuming segment of the satellite delivery process. The requirements for
building a multi-satellite constellation include quick and efficient processing of satel-
lites for launch. These requirements may also force the use of multiple launch sites and
launch-preparation areas, further driving the need for standardized and simplified
launch processing.

We need to consider launch-site processing from the start of the program. We
should target decisions and trades that support simplified processing. Changes and
processing are much easier to handle while at the integration factory. This is where the
facilities and skill levels are the most available. Launch-site processing typically takes
place at a remote location—often not owned or operated by the satellite manu-
facturer—that makes processing more difficult.

The spacecraft are transported to the launch-site processing area via protected
environment or container. The container environment must provide for temperature,
humidity, vibration, and shock protection during the shipping process. In order to
support the streamlined processing of the satellites upon their arrival, the shipping
process is subject to basic process control. We deem the process to be successful as
long as the required parameters—temperature limits, humidity limits, vibration levels,
and shock levels—are not exceeded. If these parameters exceed their limits, we need
to perform in-depth analysis or additional testing at the launch-site. But, if none of the
parameters are exceeded, the satellite can continue with the streamlined process flow
that contains little, or preferably no, testing.

Figure 19-5 depicts a streamlined launch-site process flow. The processing includes
all the steps needed to prepare the spacecraft from shipping condition to flight. condi-
tion. Launch team members receive, inspect, load onto the launch dispensers, fuel,
package, and transport the space vehicles to the launch vehicle. They charge and
monitor the flight batteries, which may be installed at the launch site, when the space-
craft are mounted on the launch vehicle.

take several weeks. Streamlined processing can reduce the overall cycle time (trans-
port to launch) to less than two weeks.

We remove all difficult tasks that can be driven to earlier processing. We minimize
hazardous operations. For instance, we can replace deployment ordnance can be
replaced with other mechanisms. We should minimize or eliminate test operations. If
the shipping process was in control (e.g. no limits exceeded on shipping sensors), we
need no test verification of the process. Well-designed tooling and process develop-
ment can make the remaining processes quick and efficient with little threat of damage
to the spacecraft.

19.1.2 Creating the Manufacturing Vision

One of the most important factors relating to a successful production program is the
creation of a manufacturing vision. More and more customers today want the “better,
cheaper, faster” solutions to their product needs. We should create the manufacturing
vision based on the customer’s and the market’s expectations for the product. The
entire project team must embrace this vision. All parties involved with manufacturing
must share the manufacturing vision and we must also include everyone else involved
with the program from the early design phases through production and test. We must
create manufacturing goals to support the vision. Creating manufacturing goals for
quality, cycle time and cost must directly relate to the manufacturing vision. For
example, if there is a manufacturing vision to produce enough satellites to populate a
constellation in a single year then the manufacturing goals must reflect this vision.
These goals must be in the form of quantified short cycle times, quantified quality lev-
els and quantified costs. Once the manufacturing goals are in place, the next step is to
execute these goals and pursue the manufacturing vision. We must constantly measure
the progress towards meeting these goals and share them with the team. We must eval-
uate progress and make necessary changes to achieve the stated goals. Changes may
occur in the design or in the production and test processes. Changing the design and
processes to meet the manufacturing goals is an iterative process. It is a give and take
scenario where the sum of the changes equals achieving the manufacturing goals.

19.1 Designing Space Systems for Manufacturability 751

Establish Goals

We must establish goals in the areas of cycle time, quality and cost. In today’s
competitive environment, these areas are everything. Many times multiple companies
have similar ideas and the only differentiating characteristic between their products is
which one makes it to the consumer market first and captures the majority of the
market share. Missing the time to market goals will cost a company market share,
revenue and brand equity. Therefore we need to know up front when our product must
be ready for our customer and then determine our cycle time goals to support this
overall schedule.

As stated previously, one of the unfortunate aspects of building satellites is that they
are usually not field serviceable. If there is a quality problem after we launch the prod-
uct into space, we have to live with the degraded performance or, in an extreme case,
accept that the product does not meet our mission requirements. We must establish
quality goals so that we can design our product accordingly. When we choose compo-
nents for our product and select processes to build and test our product, we determine
our resulting quality levels. As we choose components and processes we need to
calculate our cumulative quality predictions and track them to our goals. We will then
have the visibility to see what components and processes have a positive or negative
impact on the overall product quality. With this data we now make informed trade-off
decisions. We can determine which components or processes to change to increase the
product quality. Often quality drives cycle time. If a product is designed with low qual-
ity levels then we should expect to perform more rework and additional testing. This
in turn adds cycle time. Hardware designed around robust processes which exhibit low
defect rates result in products with fewer defects which leads to less test time, less
rework and lower costs.

Most customers desire low-cost solutions. More and more of the traditional “cost
plus” projects are being proposed as fixed price contracts. The days of cost-plus
contracts and cost overruns being absorbed by the customer are quickly disappearing.
Today the contractor carries the burden of performing to an agreed-upon fixed price.
Because of this, the contractor must know the cost goals and understand how they are
going to perform to these cost goals. Performance to cost goals directly relates to
performance to cycle time goals and quality goals. The addition of unplanned cycle
time and of effort required to correct quality problems result in increased cost. In
general any unplanned work results in additional cycle time and in additional costs.

Involve Manufacturing Early

Manufacturing early involvement may not always be the accepted way of doing
business. Early manufacturing involvement allows the design team to be informed
regarding the effects of their choices on downstream manufacturing and test opera-
tions. It empowers the design team to make informed decisions and predetermine the
expected cycle time, quality and cost performance of the assembly and test operations.
It allows management to be aware of what to expect when the product reaches assem-
bly and test.

Getting the design team to accept concurrent engineering can be a difficult task.
Many times a company needs a culture change for everyone to embrace the early
participation of manufacturing. Management must support concurrent engineering and
must pay attention to the analysis results created by the manufacturing representatives.
The manufacturing and test participants on the concurrent-engineering team must
embrace the manufacturing vision and possess the tools to influence the design to meet

752 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19,1

this vision. They must show the other members of the design team that their participa-
tion is value-added and that early team involvement will save the program time and
money in the long run. Everyone on the project team must share the manufacturing
vision in order for it to become reality.

Select Parts and Processes Effectively

As was discussed earlier the sum of the project’s individual process cycle times
(both design and manufacturing/test) must support the overall cycle time goals and the
manufacturing vision. Cycle time is inherent in the design. We predetermine the cycle
time to assemble and test a product when we choose parts and processes for a
particular product. Therefore, during the product design phase we must give appro-
priate detail to the proper selection of parts and processes. Overall the design team
must realize that a design consists of parts and processes. Often the choice of a
particular part will dictate the use of a particular process. This relationship is what
gave rise to the phrase “pick a part, pick a process”. Often design engineers choose
parts that meet a limited set of criteria from which the design engineer is searching.
They often do this without knowing the downstream impacts that these part choices
have in assembly and test.

Therefore it’s important to have manufacturing and test representatives involved in
the part selection process. They can perform analyses to show how certain parts may
require additional process steps which have lower process yields leading to more
defects, higher cycle times and ultimately higher costs.

An electronic assembly example of this type of analysis is shown in Table 19-1. We
can extend this analysis to satellite design and manufacture. Part X and part Y are
equivalent in the areas of form, fit and function; therefore we would assume that the
parts are interchangeable. However the parts vary greatly when we address associated
processes, process yields and overall cost. Part X is an 84-lead ceramic quad flat pack
that must have the leads formed, trimmed, and tinned. The part must then be loaded
into a tray for presentation to the part placement (pick and place) equipment. Form,
trim, tin and tray placement are non-preferred processes. We must perform these
processes in-house, which contributes to increased process time for that part type. The
low process yields associated with these non-preferred processes drive this part to con-
tribute 0.273 defects per unit (DPU) which leads to increased cycle time and costs
associated with rework and potential test failures. Part Y is an 84-lead plastic quad flat
pack that comes to us formed, trimmed, tinned and loaded on tape and reel to be
presented to the pick and place machine. This part uses only preferred processes which
leads to lower process cycle times, lower defects per unit and lower rework costs. All
of these factors are reflected in the lower total cost of Part Y. Therefore when selecting
a part the design team must look at the downstream impact of their part selection and
include the total cost impact of the part in their design tradeoffs.

By relating parts to processes we can determine the expected time to manufacture
and test a product, the associated quality level and the overall cost. Once we make
these estimates we can perform “what if’ analyses to see if other part/process combi-
nations will make attaining the cycle time, quality and cost goals more realistic. We
perform this iterative process early in the design phase, so we can include many design
tradeoffs between all of the disciplines.

Parts have many attributes that influence the effectiveness of manufacturing
processes. Some of these attributes fall into the categories of cost, interchangeability,
availability, reliability and simplicity. Early part-supplier involvement is critical to

ensure acceptable levels in all of these categories. The suppliers need to know what
our cost goals are for the parts being supplied. The supplier also needs to understand
our product design and how the supplier part interacts with our design. The supplier
can work with us to determine the appropriate variables to control] to ensure that the
part is interchangeable and reliable. The supplier also needs to understand our pro-
duction schedule and our material management philosophy in order to make sure that
their parts are available to us when we need them.

Part cost directly impacts product cost. It also has an impact on process develop-
ment and process execution. Processes used to assemble high-cost parts are usually
designed with additional controls and verifications. Typically this leads to higher
stress levels for the people doing the assembly work and more engineering involve-
ment for process verification. Use of higher cost parts drives the desire to perform
more rework rather than scrap hardware in the event of unwanted process variations.

Part interchangeability is critical in a product design regardless of the production
quantity. The ability to remove and replace a component quickly translates into less
non-value-added time. Interchangeable parts have the same form, fit and function for
all parts. The supplier of interchangeable parts must use process control to insure that
the parts coming into the assembly area are truly interchangeable. ff a part is not truly
interchangeable, assemblers will have to spend additional time to alter mechanical
characteristics of the part to make it fit or perform additional tests to adjust for the
varying performance of the part.

Part simplicity directly relates to part cost, interchangeability, availability and
reliability. Typically the more simple the part design the lower the cost. A simple part
will have less variables associated with its design, therefore it will positively impact
the component reliability and interchangeability. A simple part will require less pro-
duction set up time and have fewer variables to cause scrap. Therefore a simple part
should be more available for use.

Part availability is critical to maintaining product flow in the assembly area. We
never want to stop the assembly process due to parts unavailability. Many times the
risk of part unavailability is controlled by creating material inventories. However,
there can be a great.deal of cost associated with carrying part inventories. Typically
we must allocate valuable factory floor space to material storage near its point of use.
An alternative to storing material on the factory floor is to store it in a stock room and
move the material to the assembly line when we need it. Both of these scenarios result
in material being stocked at the assembly location and increase the risk of having large
quantities of parts that may become obsolete or require rework/retrofit if there is a
design change. The best alternative to either of these scenarios is to have “just in time”

754 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19.1

suppliers. Working with Just In Time suppliers requires less stocking activities and
hence less chance of having vast amounts of product that has to be reworked or retro-
fitted when there is a design change, but can add risk. The supply chain information—
especially deliveries, cycle times, and quality—must be well understood to make Just
In Time plausible. If not well understood and reliable, Just In Time is very risky.

Once material is ready for production it is time to use our manufacturing processes.
In the typical aerospace manufacturing environment, processes were developed after
the design, so the product could be manufactured and tested to meet the customer’s
needs. Before the implementation of concurrent engineering this meant that the design
was “thrown over the wall” to manufacturing and manufacturing did “what ever it
takes” to build, test and deliver the hardware to the customer. Typically this meant that
the processes were highly flexible, required specially skilled workers, lacked good
control and were seldom characterized. Today with the advent of concurrent engineer-
ing, we design in the controlled and repeatable manufacturing processes from the
beginning and the manufacturing output is highly predictable.

Concurrent engineering has brought about a change of attitude regarding manu-
facturing processes in the aerospace industry. No longer do we perform processes just
because “‘that is the way we’ve always done them.” High-quality processes are char-
acterized, controlled and repeatable. Many of these processes have been borrowed
from the commercial manufacturing world. The mass reflow of electronic assemblies
is an example of this exchange. Mass reflow—the mass soldering of parts on printed
circuit boards using a single, controlled thermal cycle—was developed to efficiently
produce electronic products for delivery to consumers. Although slow in gaining
acceptance, we now use it for spaceflight hardware and other high reliability
applications.

The concurrent manufacturing engineer should never be afraid to ask “why” we
design or process something the way we do. An example of this is to look at the
integration of deployables on a satellite. In the past certain deployables have always
been integrated with the satellite in the vertical position. This was done to minimize
the amount of stress that could be preloaded into the deployable mechanisms. Chang-
ing the satellite from the horizontal position to the vertical position and back to the
horizontal position requires time, space, additional tooling and creates a lot of risk
associated with handling the satellite. With today’s modern analysis tools much of the
stresses associated with preloading the deployable mechanisms in the horizontal posi-
tion can be modeled and the risks analyzed. If the risks are determined to be low
enough then the satellite plane change from horizontal to vertical can be eliminated.
This will save time, space, and tooling and also reduce handling risk.

Typically satellite manufacturing has been a low-volume process. Currently many
companies are proposing multi-satellite constellations. These multi-satellite projects
drive manufacturing to create production lines for assembling and testing satellites.
The “assembly line” concept of these satellite production lines has roots in the
automotive industry. Many of the new satellite production lines take mass production
assembly line technology one-step further and implement many of the “lean” manu-
facturing principles currently used in the automotive industry. Some of these “lean”
manufacturing principles include Just In Time suppliers, supplier partnering, concur-
rent engineering, pull production,” and statistically controlled processes.

Other satellite manufacturers have taken the “lean” manufacturing philosophy to
the next step— “agile” manufacturing. “Agile” manufacturing incorporates all of the
principles used in “lean” manufacturing with the addition of flexibility. An “agile”

19,1 Designing Space Systems for Manufacturability 755

manufacturing line can support multiple product lines on the same assembly line. It
also can adapt and respond to product changes which may be directed by changing
customer wants and needs.

One of the guiding principles behind “lean” and “agile” manufacturing is waste
elimination. We must evaluate all of the processes associated with assembly and test
in terms of value-added activities and non-value-added activities. During process
development and implementation, we should maximize the value-added processes and
the non-value-added activities should be minimized. Reduction of the non-value-
added process steps will drive waste elimination.

Reduction in the number of inspection points is a good example of waste elim-
ination. Typically satellite production programs have had a high content of quality
inspection points. Inspection points are examples of non-value-added operations. In
the past multiple inspection points were required because the assembly processes were
highly variable and uncontrolled. By institutionalizing concurrent engineering,
processes are now designed into the assembly flow that are controlled and repeatable.
Because the output of these processes are predictable, we no longer need multiple
inspection points. Therefore we eliminate waste by removing the non-value-added
inspection steps.

Another non-value-added recurring process is test. Because test is non-value-
added, we need to be minimize it to eliminate waste. Although some testing is
required, we should minimize redundant testing. One of the benefits of using con-
trolled and repeatable processes is that the output from these processes is predictable.
Therefore we don’t have to test something that has been tested earlier if we know that
the processes used after the initial test have not injected variability into the product. A
good example of this principle is the previously-mentioned minimization of launch-
site processing. We test the spacecraft prior to shipping it to the launch site, and don’t
test it at the launch site unless shipping indicators or sensors show that it exceeded a
shipping process limit.

Test is just another process. During the early phases of design, we should view the
assembly and test efforts as processes that must be controlled and repeatable. Similar
to satellite manufacturing processes, we should be establish goals for all test processes.
These goals should relate to cycle time, quality (predicted test yields), and cost. We
should question any non-value-added steps and, if possible, eliminate them. If a test
continually exhibits a 100% yield rate then we need to determine if the test is
necessary.

Reality is that test yields are not always 100% and finding defects at higher levels
of integration can negatively impact cycle time and cost. The goal of performing a test
is to find the defect at the lowest possible level of integration. This reduces the amount

* Pull Production Systems

Traditional satellite manufacture and mass production in general is based on a push system.
In other words, the material and work-in-process is generally pushed or processed through the
system. The emphasis is on processing the hardware through the production line as quickly as
possible. Unfortunately, this can create pockets of inefficiency and bottlenecks (throughput
limiters). These problems require excess factory space for inventory of material and product,
and can create excessive defects and cycle times.

Lean production utilizes a pull production methodology. Material and work-in-process is
not processed until upstream stations are ready. Downstream processes do not create excess
inventory, because the production system will not allow production to continue unnecessarily.
The system is tuned for a continuous process flow, with necessary materials being delivered
Just In Time in small quantities.

756 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19.1

of time and effort required to get to the problem area and fix it. Even after tests have
been performed there are instances when the quality of the lower level hardware may
still be suspect at the higher levels of integration. Therefore it is important to design in
accessibility at the higher levels of integration. We may need this accessibility to
repair a defect that has passed undetected through a lower level test operation or to
incorporate late design modifications prior to sealing the satellite. Design for acces-
sibility needs to be a goal of the program vision because it doesn’t happen without
conscious effort. For a detailed discussion of process design and production trends, see
Shunk [1992].

19.1.3 Influencing the Design

Success of production depends on the manufacturing/production disciplines being
involved throughout the product design. Through concurrent engineering, we develop
the product involving various disciplines of the trade. For satellite design, this includes
such expertise as electrical, mechanical, software, test, industrial, and reliability
engineering; it also includes other less-technical but equally important functions such
as contracts, finance, procurement and scheduling. The manufacturing role, in partic-
ular, acts as the main interface between many product teams due to their direct respon-
sibility of ensuring a producible product. All experts must get involved with the design
early and continually to the extent they can influence the product to meet their respec-
tive goals or to compromise with others. At the very least, if the experts can’t reach an
acceptable term, they can highlight the issue very early in the program so that they can
continually work it into an acceptable term.

To influence the design, the program team must first establish a common vision for
the enterprise. This common vision serves to create a working platform that allows the
supply chain to collectively communicate. It provides the central theme to which the
program will focus regardless of where anyone’s portion of the business is located.
The common vision creates the need for goals and guidelines in each concurrent
design area within the program. Overarching goals must be established to provide
incentive for the program; they should be difficult to attain, yet attainable within the
program life.

To supplement the goals, the team must establish specifically defined rules and
guidelines to bring the goals to fruition. The vision, goals, and guidelines provide the
program with a standard, central direction that, in turn, provides the program with the
opportunity to be efficient and united. The intention of a common vision is not to strip
individual company identity, rather to converge on certain business ideas that alleviate
challenges due to diverse mindsets, backgrounds, and corporate cultures.

Designing to goals and guidelines sounds simple but may be difficult in practice;
few programs have these clearly outlined at the inception of the program. Implement-
ing goals at the beginning of the program is where they are most effective. Studies
have shown that approximately 70% of the cost of the system is fixed by the end of the
conceptual design phase [Wade and Welch, 1996].

A concept becomes feasible through refinement and, in turn, producible through
other iterations of refinement. If we initiate the guidelines of design at the conceptual
level, it is less costly and less painful to iterate to a feasible design. The cost to correct
problems occurring from a previous program phase increases by an order of magni-
tude, approximately (Fig. 19-7). A simple design change during the conceptual design
phase will cost 10x during broadband phase and 100x during engineering model
phase.

design matures.

The feasible design should already be largely configured to the goals and, therefore,
iterating to the production level should be relatively smooth. The iteration process is
smoother because the team knows what is expected through the long-term goals.

758 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19.1

Production goals and guidelines should include all production-related information
for the product. This information encompasses the expectations for both parts and
processes as these two ingredients form a product. It also provides structure for the
product to grow properly since it addresses quality, capabilities, production rates,
facility requirements, procurement, cost, warranty, manufacturability, testability, etc.
For example, The design dictates product quality. If the product has a 2-sigma design,
the best we can expect is a 2-sigma product.

Knowing the expectations initially not only assists the product to mature into pro-
duction, and assists the product team to develop. Having these goals gives the team a
purpose to commonly focus their attention. Successful teamwork resolves issues
seemingly otherwise unresolvable. Communication becomes clearer and less conflict-
ing because the team uses common terms to explain the common goals. A good prod-
uct team forms to produce a working product without relying upon functional titles and
positions. Additionally, trust forms within the team. Yet, trust and competition are not
mutually exclusive. Team members may and will form partnerships with competitors
for different projects or products, but this practice must not hinder the primary busi-
ness relationships. Lack of trust causes program inefficiencies.

Initially, the prime contractor must derive the goals and guidelines; however, the
suppliers must then work closely with the prime contractor to further develop,
understand and modify the expectations as necessary. In any event, if team members
don’t understand or believe the goals, the team’s ability to influence the design is
diluted, and the prime contractor must begin to educate them about the goals.
Furthermore, it is especially important to derive the goals so they are meaningful. For
example, assembly time of a high volume, high complexity product (indicative of the
constellation satellite industry) typically comprises less than 35% of the overall cycle
time while production test comprises the remaining 65% (Olivieri [1997]). Using the
Pareto approach we find that the greatest opportunity to influence the design is in
production test*.

Design influence is most effective through mathematical analysis. Personal bias
and tradition are not the basis for influence. When we select a part for a product, we
inherently select the process as well. This means that predicting behaviors (quality,
reliability, cycle time, assembly process, etc.) of the product is possible. We do this by
collecting data from suppliers but where data is not available we either run an experi-
ment or locate like-product data. Key predictions include, but are not limited to: defect
per unit, defects per million opportunities, statistical tolerance and variability assess-
ments, design to unit production cost, solids modeling, cycle time, process modeling
and mapping, design of experiments, and simulations.

Having the data equates to having the knowledge to influence design. The only way
we achieve key goals in areas such as quality, manufacturability, and profit is if they
are designed in.

Influencing the design is an enterprise challenge. Awareness of our up and down
stream product map helps us make smart decisions for the overall program. Locally

* The Pareto Principle
If we rank order contributors to a problem from greatest influence to least influence, the
Pareto Principle states that only a few of the contributors will comprise the bulk of the influ-
ence. In general, 80% of the contribution comes from 20% of the factors. Pareto analysis is a
technique for ranking items according to their contribution and analyzing the top contributors,
or the “‘vital few.” The other 80% of the factors that only influence 20% of the contribution

are the “trivial many.”

19.1 Designing Space Systems for Manufacturability 759

maximizing cycle time, quality, assembly ease and other areas of importance, does not
always provide the same benefit to the overall program. Standardization of analysis
tools, metrics, goals, and guidelines help to relate design impacts to the supply chain.

19.1.4 Process Development and Verification

Quality, and the resulting efficiency of manufacturing, is never an accident. It is the
result of good design practices and sound process development methods—with the
addition of management and execution diligence. Significant process development
and verification activities must take place to manufacture high quality products. For
satellite manufacturing, we need to apply these methods at all levels—suppliers, sub-
tier suppliers, payload assembly and test, space vehicle integration, and launch
operations.

In the manufacturing context, we define a process as any activity that changes or
touches the product or requires resources. The objective is to use simple, uncom-
plicated processes that yield high quality results with short cycle times. Very few
processes meet these general criteria without development. Therefore, sound develop-
ment methods are key. The end goal is to have controlled and repeatable high-quality
processes during the production phase of the program.

Development Methods

We can apply structured development methods to process and product develop-
ment. Many methods exist, and most have merit. Here, we use a four-phase process
development, a.k.a. process characterization, model. We should first apply this model
to critical processes and then extend it to other processes as necessary.

The process characterization model consists of four phases.

Phase 1: Process Definition—Map the process to understand the variables
and characteristics involved.

Phase 2: Process Capability—Establish current level of performance of the
process. Does the process perform as needed?

Phase 3: Process Optimization—Investigate the variables to determine
which variables drive the process output. Determine the best levels
for these variables to provide optimal process output.

Phase 4: Process Control—Monitor the process and its important variables
to determine when its performance has changed or is out of control.

We iterate the cycle to further improve the process as necessary. (See Fig. 19-8.)

We characterize the process to identify and remove sources of variation.
Ultimately, variation is the cause for product quality problems. We use statistical tools,
such as Design of Experiments and Statistical Process Control, to reduce the variation,
which improves quality—and subsequently reduces cost and cycle time. See Mont-
gomery [1996] for detailed discussions about statistical tools.

Cycles of Learning

In addition to the iterations caused by characterizing the production process, we
may need additional cycles of learning when developing satellite constellation produc-
tion systems. Varying techniques are available, depending on the subject matter.

For instance, we use simulation techniques to model and predict performance.
Discrete event simulation packages can model processes, factories, and whole supply

chains. We can use these models to determine resource requirements, facility size,
inventory schemes, and delivery schedules. We can explore proposed changes to pre-
established baselines without risk.

A second source of cycles of learning is the use of prototyping. Prototyping allows
for physical evaluation—appearance and dimensional—while changes are easier and
less expensive to make. Production changes are extremely costly, and potentially
devastating. We can potentially avoid them through early prototyping. The use of
Dynamic Test Models and Engineering Development Models are advanced functional
examples of prototypes.

A third source is the use of pathfinding activities. The more complex a system and
its logistics, the more beneficial pathfinding activities become. They revolve around
building a scale representation, usually 1:1, of a product and using it to simulate all
handling, manufacturing, and logistical activities. For satellites, this includes practic-
ing and iterating every process, from subsystem receipt to integration processing to
launch processing. The resulting benefits of pathfinding include handling streamlin-
ing, mechanical checkfit verification, documentation improvement, process develop-
ment, tooling improvement, facility development, and logistical simplification.

In short, any activity that we can simulate or realize before we create an actual
product can have significant payback, if enacted. These activities are important tools
to gain significant process and product knowledge.

19.1.5 Production

All of the previous phases—creating the manufacturing vision, influencing the
design, and process development—lead to the final phase—production. All previous
goals are to make this phase easy to execute. Failure or lack of attention in the previous
phases becomes readily apparent here. They surface as schedule slips, exceeded bud-
gets, and poor quality.

Executing the overall plans and goals established in the earlier phases is paramount.
While many production issues are similar for building one satellite or one hundred,

19.1 Designing Space Systems for Manufacturability 761

some areas are significantly different. These areas include supply-chain management
and production floor management.

Supply-chain Management

A supply-chain focus is key to the successfully executing the production phase of
a multiple satellite program. The supply-chain is defined as all of the suppliers and
activities involved with producing a satellite. This involves the major suppliers—bus,
payload, and antennas—and the minor suppliers.

Communicating and coordinating across the supply-chain is critical. Fundament-
ally, all the suppliers need to have a common vision and sense of direction. In effect,
the major suppliers become partners. Openly communicating goals, expectations, and
problem solving is essential. To facilitate communication, we need to seek a common
language and culture through common training and team building. The resulting pro-
gram culture program can be built on the strengths of each partner.

Concurrent engineering across company lines must occur. All company sections
must share the key design rules or characteristics early in the process and maintain
them throughout the program. We must carefully define and fully understand the
_interfaces and handoffs. We should develop and use common tooling and processes.
For instance, shipping containers carrying subassemblies to final integration should
support integration activities without a tooling transfer. They should seamlessly
integrate into the factory. Finally, common metrics across the supply-chain allow for
meaningful summation of data, so managers can judge the overall system health.
These metrics should center around quality, cycle time, and critical parameter
performance.

Production Floor Management

Performance and executing the production phase uses principles similar to any
production environment. In addition to supply-chain management, consistent perfor-
mance takes lean manufacturing principles of production floor management, including
good processes, qualified workers, and timely information.

Short-cycle, well understood processes and overall processing is fundamental to
lean manufacturing. Simulation or other flow design tools help to determine optimum
production flows that reduce the risks of production delays. The flows and processing
should include Just In Time concepts to minimize Work In Process inventory and
improve quality and cycle time. Just In Time hinges on delivering material items when
the flow needs them in a pull fashion. We don’t move items until they are ready for
processing. Less hardware is in process, thereby reducing the potential for damage and
reducing overall floor space requirements.

Qualified workers that understand the processing of space hardware are still
required for satellite production. While still required, their roles and specific skills are
very different than traditional programs. Highly specialized and narrowly skilled
positions now become broader and more generalized. The design attributes resulting
from a successful multi-satellite design team will require less intensive processing.
While less difficult, the processing needs to be more repeatable. We can train or certify
workers for each repeatable operation, so the can typically monitor their own work.
We minimize quality inspections. Instead, the individual or the team is responsible for
performing each operation correctly and safely.

The capture and use of timely production data is a third production floor manage-
ment challenge. Producing multiple satellites with short cycle times requires us to

762 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19.1

collect, use, and archive data differently from traditional methods. Paper, the tradi-
tional documentation medium, is too cumbersome, untimely, and not available to
multiple disciplines. Constellations based on a large number of satellites require
volumes of data be available to multiple users. We need factory systems for work
instruction and process planning; transmittal of product data between suppliers, inte-
grators, and users; and for factory data collection. Factory data collection includes
calibration, as-built, work-in-progress tracking, and quality data and/or information.
An added advantage is using common tools for these functions across the supply-
chain.

19.1.6 Summary

These methods apply exactly to multiple satellite constellations with communica-
tions payloads. These methods were applied to the Iridium® program, with outstanding
cost and schedule results. Constellation reliability and performance data is starting to
be collected at time of this publication.

Smaller constellations, non-communication payloads, and high-value missions
may use subsets of these practices. In all cases, thoughtful selection of parts and
processes and skillful application of concurrent engineering practices are paramount

More detailed information regarding the application of these methods and subse-
quent tradeoffs will become available as more constellations complete deployment.
Currently, competitive issues restrict information flow as much data is viewed as
proprietary.

The Iridium® Satellite Assembly Process

The Iridium®* Satellite Assembly Factory comprises 15 process stations. These stations
complete specific functions. The satellites flow from station to station throughout the factory
until Station 15, At Station 15, workers pack and send the satellites to the launch-site. During
steady-state production, the total time to proceed from Station 1 to Station 15 is 24 days.

Station 0: Material Receipt

All material and subsystems are received into the satellite factory. Major systems received
into the factory include:

¢ Gateway antennas (4)

* Crosslink antennas, fixed (2) and moving (2)

¢ Panels (communications and gateway)

* Main mission antennas (3)

Solar arrays (2)

* Satellite bus assembly

The satellite bus assembly, complete with propulsion and guidance systems, is received
already mounted on a wheel-mounted dolly. This dolly, collaboratively developed for use
throughout the satellite delivery process, is used for satellite assembly, shipment, and launch-

Site processing. The dolly also allows for access to all sides of the satellite via rotation, and can
be easily maneuvered through the factory.

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 765
19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning

Herbert Hecht,* SoHaR Incorporated

When a bulb in our desk lamp burns out, it is easily replaced. When the switch that
controls the bulb fails, the replacement is not quite as simple but stil] within the capa-
bilities of most mechanically inclined teenagers and even some adults. We expect a
higher reliability of the switch than of the lamp because it requires more effort to repair
a failure. When a spacecraft command receiver fails on orbit, it takes an extra-
ordinarily long screwdriver to fix it. You get the general idea: the command receiver
has to be much more reliable than the light bulb or the switch on the desk lamp. This
need for very high reliability in all parts and subsystems of a spacecraft is the basis for
including a reliability program in most space projects.

Before describing the details of the reliability program, let us briefly discuss the
meaning and metrics of reliability in the context of space missions. A common defi-
nition of reliability is “The probability that a device will function without failure over
a specified time period or amount of usage.” [IEEE, 1984] If the phrase “without fail-
ure” is taken to mean “without failure of any kind” it defines basic reliability; if it is
interpreted as “without failure that impairs the mission” it defines mission reliability.
In spacecraft that employ extensive redundancy there can be a significant difference
between these two reliability metrics. Mission reliability is the more important
concept, and when we use “reliability” without a qualifier, it always means mission
reliability.

The elementary expression for the reliability of a single item, not subject to wearout
failures, is

R=e4 (19-1)

where A is the failure rate and t is the time. Here, R, is the probability that the item will
operate without failure for time ¢ (success probability). At this point we recognize only
two outcomes: success and failure, and therefore the probability of failure, F, is given
by:
F=1-R (19-2)
More refined and practical methods of assessing mission success will be described
later.
For a spacecraft made up of n nonredundant elements, all equally essential for

spacecraft operation, the system (or series) reliability, Rs, or success probability, is
computed as

n
-yA,
R=] [R= (19-3)
1

where R; (i = 1...n) is the reliability and ; the failure rate of the individual elements.
For failure probabilities (A) less than 0.1 or reliability greater than 0.9, the following

approximation is frequently used

eAtz 1 —Ar (19-4)
Most reliability computations, particularly prior to detailed design, use failure prob-
abilities (which can be summed) rather than reliability values (that must be multiplied)

Where a system consists of n elements in parallel, and each of these elements can
by itself satisfy the requirements, the parallel (or redundant) reliability, R,, is given by

n
R, =1-] [q-R) (19-5)

where the reliability of the parallel elements is equal, say R,, the above simplifies to
R,=1-(-R,y (19-6)

In terrestrial applications it is customary to distinguish between active and quies-
cent (dormant) failure rates, the latter being about one-tenth of the active rates. This
reduction accounts for the absence of electrical stress when a component is not
energized. However the high reliability requirements of the space environment cause
components to be derated so that the failure probability due to electrical stresses even

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 767

in the active mode is quite small. The distinction between active and quiescent failure
rates is therefore much less important for spacecraft applications.

When the spacecraft does not have any redundant elements, a plot of reliability vs.
mission time will be concave toward the origin, but when redundancy is provided the
initial part of the reliability plot tends to be convex to the origin. This accounts for the
shape of the mission reliability curve in Fig. 19-10.

Fig. 19-10. Frequently Used Reliability Concepts. Design life is governed by wear-out and
expendable stores. Mean mission duration is less than design life because failures
can terminate a mission before end-of-life conditions are reached.

Design life, the intended operational time on orbit (see Section 19.2.1), is an
important parameter for the reliability program. It determines the amount of con-
sumables (control gas, etc.) that must be provided and establishes quality and test
requirements for items subject to wearout, such as bearings and batteries. The mission
reliability calculated at the design life is the mission success probability. Since this
quantity is less than 1.0, the expected life is less than the design life. The customary
measure of the expected life is the mean mission duration or MMD, given by:

MMD =ITdR (19-7)

where T represents a horizontal (time) line in the shaded area of Fig. 19-10 and dR is
the associated (vertical) increment in reliability. MMD is a frequently used figure of
merit for spacecraft reliability improvement programs.

Most satellites perform multiple functions (e.g., weather observation and tracking
ocean traffic), and performance of any of these functions may still be useful even
when it is degraded. Under such circumstances the success criteria are no longer ob-
vious. Should failure be defined as the event when the spacecraft fails to furnish any
useful data, or should it be the point at which its performance deviates from any part
of the specification? This problem can be addressed by establishing multiple reliabil-
ity requirements. Assume that the specified weather observations are intended to use
three frequency bands but that observations on even a single band are still useful. The
success probability (SP) requirement may be formulated as shown in Table 19-2.

768 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19,2

TABLE 19-2. Hypothetical Reliability Requirement for a Weather Satellite.

At least 1 band operational

At least 2 bands operational
All 3 bands operational

*Success Probability

During the development of the satellite it may be found that it will be difficult to
obtain a success probability for all three bands operational greater than 0.80 but that
the single band mission reliability can be raised to 0.99. If the requirements shown in
Table 19-2 are part of a contractual document it may take lengthy negotiations to agree
on the change, even though it may be technically quite acceptable. To avoid such
situations, mission effectiveness rather than reliability may be specified. There are
several definitions of mission effectiveness [MIL-HDBK-338B], but all aim at a single
metric that represents reliability weighted by the operational capability level to which
the reliability is applicable. In the above example assume that the 1, 2, and 3 band
capabilities are assigned weights of 0.25, 0.35, and 0.4, respectively (it is desirable that
the weights add up to 1.0). A simple mission effectiveness requirement may then be
stated as 0.25 x 0.96 + 0.35 x 0.92 + 0.4 x 0.85 = 0.902. A similar calculation shows
that raising the single band reliability to 0.99 will not compensate for reducing the
3 band reliability to 0.80, but that this reduction could be tolerated if the 2 band reli-
ability is raised to 0.95 at the same time. Where there is a sound technical basis for
specifying mission effectiveness it will generally reduce both cost and development
time compared to specifying multiple reliability values. As indicated in Fig. 19-10, the
effectiveness curve will lie above the reliability curve when the latter is constructed
for an “all up” satellite.

19.2.1 Design for Reliability

The process for designing a reliable system is shown in Table 19-3. Evidence that
simplicity makes for reliability can be seen in Table 19-4, which is excerpted from an
earlier publication by the author of this section [Hecht and Hecht, 1985]. Complex
functions had higher failure rates. In each case shown in the last columns of the table,
there were probably compelling reasons for using the more complex implementation,
but the reliability consequences of these decisions must also be recognized.

To make sure that the process leading to a reliable system is being carried out as
intended, there must be an explicit assignment of responsibility for its implementation.
Several alternatives for the assignment are listed in Table 19-5 in order of increasing
direct cost. For very small satellites the low cost advantage of (A) or (B) will usually
outweigh the benefits of the last two alternatives. When subsystems get more numer-
ous and larger, alternatives (C) and (D) may result in overall savings, in spite of their
higher immediate cost.

The activities listed below are suitable for alternatives (B) or (C). Where alternative
(A) is adopted, at least a Reliability Program Plan should be prepared and a Failure
Reporting System should be established. Alternative (D) implies that the program will
be managed by reliability specialists who will generate their own process require-
ments.

for achieving them, and establishes milestones for evaluating the achievements. It also

serves as an agreement with other spacecraft functions regarding their responsibilities
in support of reliability. The most significant interfaces usually are with quality assur-
ance, test, configuration management, and thermal control.

Failure Modes Analysis

Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) can provide valuable
insights into how design decisions affect reliability. Typical benefits are

* Exposing single point failure modes in a subsystem assumed to be redundant
* Identifying opportunities for functional redundancy (see Sec. 19.2.3)

* Permitting components to assume a safe mode in the absence of required sig-
nals or power

Failure modes are usually recorded at the part level, e.g., for a capacitor the failure
modes are open and short (sometimes a change in capacitance may also be recorded).
Failure effects are assessed at the part level and also at higher levels such as assembly
and major component or subsystem. The failure effect of a shorted capacitor may be a
bias shift on a transistor (part level) which in turn cuts off the output of a demodulator
(assembly level) and causes loss of voice communications (subsystem level). In addi-
tion, the FMECA forms usually contain fields for the method of detection and the
means of failure alleviation. In our example, the detection may be by an output moni-
tor included in the demodulator, and the failure alleviation may be use of an alternate
voice channel.

A probability is associated with each failure mode, and the probabilities of all fail-
ure modes that cause a given effect are added in a summary section of the FMECA.
Loss of modulator output cited in the example may be caused by several failure modes
of the demodulator components, and loss of the voice channel may be caused by fail-
ure modes other than those in the demodulator. Although there may be considerable
error in the estimate of a given failure mode, these tend to be evened out when arriving
at estimates of failure effects at the subsystem and higher levels.

In digital microcircuits it is usually not possible to conduct FMECA at the level of
primitive elements (gates or transistors) because there are too many of them and
because causes of failure may affect multiple elements (e.g., voids in the oxide layer).
The FMECA may then be conducted at the function level, where functions are timers,
counters, and shift registers. Failure modes at the function level are generally not as
well known as those at the part level, and a single cause of failure may affect multiple
functions. In assessing the effects of failure at the higher level it may therefore be
advisable to be conservative.

Sneak circuit analysis is usually considered a part of FMECA. This analysis
establishes that explosive or other one-shot devices will not be accidentally actuated,
and that they will always be actuated when intended. A good guide to FMECA is
MIL-STD-1629.

Failure Reporting
Failure Reporting and Corrective Action (FRACAS) is a key element in any reli-
ability program because:

a. It informs concerned parties that a failure has been observed

b. It furnishes a record through which trends and correlations can be evaluated
at a future time (an example of a trend is that the probability of failure in-

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 771

creases after x hours of use; an example of a correlation is that part y fails
during a particular step in the test sequence).

c. It permits reassessment of the predicted failure rates and is the basis for
consequent modifications of the fault avoidance or fault tolerance provisions.

Uses b and c require recording the operating time of all units in service; usually by
means of an operating log maintained for each part number, with separate records for
each serial number. Corrective action is typically also recorded on the failure reporting
form. This facilitates configuration management in that it establishes at what point a
failed component or subsystem has been returned to operational status. Reporting on
the same form also facilitates future investigation of the effectiveness of the repair
action. Corrective action frequently involves two steps: in the first, a failed part is
replaced by a good one of the same design; the second step addresses the root cause,
e.g., by tightening limits for the incoming test of this part. The results of retest are
included in the corrective action report.
To establish a FRACAS the following must be identified:

* Scope of the activities (e.g., system test, field test, normal usage)
* Responsibility for cost and for report initiation

* Method and frequency of reporting (e.g., paper or electronic, each incident or
by time interval)

The format used for reporting of failures and corrective actions is not standardized.
The following are the most essential data:
1. Incident identification (e. g., report serial number)
. Date, time and locale of the incident
. Part no., name of the failed component, and its serial number.
. Higher level part or system identifiers (subsystem or major component)
. Lower level part or system identifiers (usually available only after diagnosis)

. Operation in progress and environmental conditions when failure was

7. Immediate and higher level effects of failure
8. Names of individuals responsible for detection, verification and analysis
9. Diagnosis of immediate, contributory and root causes of the failure

10. Dates and nature of repair and results of retest.

Low Cost Methods of Reliability Assessment

Reliability prediction (usually by using a failure rate handbook) or estimation
(based on experience with the component population) are routinely required for major
satellite programs. Representative failure rates for reliability estimation are shown in
Table 19-6.

These failure rates are abstracted from MIL-HDBK-217F and can be used for
reliability predictions based on parts type and count. Lower reliability parts such as
commercial parts have failure rates that are much higher (between 12 and 333 times).
Values shown in the table are expected failures in 109 hours, they correspond to A
in Eq. (19-1).

failure rates are abstracted from MIL-HDBK-217F and can be used for reliability

cial parts have failure rates between 12 and 333 times these failure rates. Values
are failures in 109 hours, they correspond to A in Eq. (19-1).

Parts count reliability estimation may be used for comparison of design alterna-
tives, when test or on-orbit incidents indicate insufficient reliability, or when a more
expensive payload is to be incorporated (which increases the cost of failure).

Software Considerations

Spacecraft operations are becoming increasingly dependent on software, in the
spacecraft and in the ground segment. There have been spectacular launch and on orbit
failures due to software faults, but many more missions have been saved by software
(used for work-around) than have been lost due to it. Thus the way to more effective
space missions may not so much lie in minimizing software as in making appropriate
use of it. It should also be mentioned that most software used in spacecraft is actually
firmware (programs furnished as read-only-memory chips).

Reliability assessment of software is not a precise science. The most widely ac-
cepted techniques depend on test (very expensive if high levels of reliability are
required) or on independent verification and validation (even more expensive and less
likely to yield a quantitative assessment). When software is simple and well structured
its reliability is usually high and the cost of evaluation is low.

Cost effective software reliability assessment starts with an examination of the
ways in which software can impact the mission. A convenient format for this is a fault
tree, as shown in Fig. 19-11.

In this example, the software failures that are most likely to lead to mission failure
are:

1. Complete halting of execution, e. g., due to being in an infinite loop or being
directed to an incorrect memory location.

2. Faulty antenna orientation due to an antenna drive failure or faulty attitude
determination

3. Failure to deploy the solar array.

Double failures are required to halt execution of programs and deployment of the
solar array, because both of these have backup mechanisms. Faulty antenna orienta-
tion can be caused in two ways, and there is currently no backup provision for this
hazard. Once this deficiency is recognized, alternatives for mitigation will be investi-
gated. Re-orienting the spacecraft by ground command may be a worst case backup,
provided that ground commands will be received regardless of initial antenna position.

Redundancy management is also frequently a very critical software function han-
dled by the spacecraft computer.

A study of the space shuttle avionics software showed that causes of high severity
failures were overwhelmingly associated with rare events, such as handling of
exception conditions, management of hardware failures, and response to unusual or
incorrect crew commands [Hecht and Crane, 1994]. These data, as well as others cited
in the reference, indicate that testing of spacecraft software should demonstrate that
unusual events in the environment (including hardware and software failures) are cor-
rectly handled.

19.2.2 Design for Fault Avoidance

Fault avoidance is most effective when there are only a very small number of
significant failure modes. Common fault avoidance techniques are shown in
Table 19-7, and application guidance is provided below.

Process Control

Control of the manufacturing process can only be exercised where parts are specif-
ically manufactured for the spacecraft. In most cases this includes the structure,
propulsion components, and segments of the environmental conditioning system.
Control over the assembly process can usually be exercised for the entire spacecraft,

Coding Techniques | Memory upset Digital components only

Part Selection Modest improvement

Technique Most Suitable for

Critical measurements must be known |

and this is where major emphasis for fault avoidance through tighter process control
should be placed.

A good starting point for investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of tighter
process controls for fault avoidance is to investigate past failures in test and operation,
and, particularly for new components or processes, difficulties that have been experi-
enced during engineering evaluations. These constitute the “current deficiencies”
listed in Table 19-7, and for each the underlying cause of failure must be identified.
Where dispersions in material or process characteristics are implicated, tighter process
control can be expected to make a significant contribution to fault avoidance.

Design Margins, Derating and Environmental Protection

Design margins and derating accomplish the same goal: prevention of component
failure due to higher than expected external stresses or other deviations from the
nominal conditions. The term design margin is mostly used in structure and thermal
subsystems and means that a component is designed to carry more than the expected
load. Propellant margins in propulsion systems are an equivalent concept. The term
derating is primarily applied to electrical and electronic components and involves the
specification of a component that carries a higher rating than is needed for the
application.

The reliability improvement by these practices is most significant if a part is
initially used near its design strength or electrical rating. As an example (from
MIL-HDBK-217F), the predicted base failure rate for a fixed film resistor at 40° C and
used at 0.9 of rated power is 0.0022 x 10-®/hour. Selecting a higher rated resistor, for
which the dissipated power constitutes only 0.3 of rated power reduces this to 0.0011
x 10-6/hour. But further reductions are hard to achieve. A resistor for which the dissi-
pated power is 0.1 of the rating still has a failure rate 0.0009 x 10-®/hour. Derated parts
not only cost more, but are frequently larger and heavier than the ones that they
replace. Derating only reduces the failure probability with respect to the stress that is
being derated. In the example of the fixed film resistor, derating reduces the probabil-
ity of failure due to power surges but it does not offer any protection against failures
due to lead breakage or corroded connections.

Environmental protection can take the form of shock mounting, cooling or heating
provisions, and shielding against radiation effects, Where derating reduces the failure
probability by increasing the strength of the components, environmental protection
reduces the failure probability by reducing the stress levels. In many cases, environ-
mental protection adds considerable weight, and this, rather than cost, limits the
amount of protection that can be provided.

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 775

Coding Techniques

Coding provides robustness by permitting continued operation in the presence of a
defined spectrum of errors, primarily in memory and data transmission. Coding tech-
niques are also available for detection or toleration of errors in arithmetic processors
but are seldom used in this capacity in spacecraft computers.

The important coding techniques are error detecting code and error correcting
code. The former is intended primarily for fault isolation (i. e., preventing an incorrect
result from being used in subsequent operations). The latter is a fault tolerance mech-
anism that corrects a class of errors and permits operations to continue normally. All
codes require the addition of check bits to the bit pattern that represents the basic
information. If there is agreement between the check and information bits, the data is
accepted. If there is no agreement, the data is rejected (for error detecting code) or
corrected (for error correcting code).

The cost effectiveness of error correcting codes is shown in the following hypothet-
ical example for a commercial earth observation satellite. The payload computer’s 4
megabit dynamic random access memory has a mass of 400 gr. This memory (which
does not incorporate error correction or detection) is expected to sustain two “upsets”
per orbit-year. Upon detection of an upset by ground monitoring, the memory is
reloaded, an operation that typically loses data from two orbits. The expected mission
income is $1,000 per orbit. In the absence of error correction, the cost of memory
upsets will therefore be $4,000 per year. The extra memory and coding/decoding chips
will add 100 gr. to the mass of the memory and will cost $1,000. The cost/mass ratio
for this satellite is $5,000 per kg, and thus the extra 100 gr will be equivalent to $500.
In this example the cost of the error correction will be paid for in less than one-half
orbit-year. As discussed in Sec. 8.1, the number of upsets to be expected depends on
the size and type of memory, the orbit, and the amount of shielding provided by the
spacecraft structure and the memory enclosure. In most cases coding is found to be
very cost effective.

Part Selection and Screening

Screening (selection of parts by test) is a process that eliminates units that have a
higher likelihood of failing in service than the other units in the lot [Chan,1994].
Whereas derating reduces the probability of failure by moving the average strength of
the components higher, screening reduces the probability of failure by rejecting the
lower tail of the distribution as shown in Fig. 19-12. A typical screening procedure for
semiconductors is to measure the leakage current at elevated temperature.

The cost of screening is made up of two elements: the cost of the rejected product,
and the cost of test. The cost effectiveness is high (1) for parts with an initially high
failure rate, (2) for modest reliability improvements (generally those in which not
more than 20% of the product is rejected), and (3) where the cost of test is small
compared to the unit cost of the product under test (not over 10%)

Screening does not involve an increase in the size of the components and it is there-
fore preferred to derating for bulky or heavy parts. Screening is not very effective for
reducing the failure probability in a mode for which components have been derated
because the failure probability due to external stresses in that mode is already very
low. Screening can be applied to assemblies, e.g., by subjecting them to combined
temperature and vibration environments and is thus more versatile than derating.
Screening at the assembly level is also likely to result in a lower ratio of test cost to
product cost and thus produces a higher figure of merit.

Screening is really a crutch that permits the use of products that do not, as delivered,
meet all of the requirements of an given application. A more desirable reliability mea-
sure is to tighten the control of the process so that it can be relied on not to produce the
outliers that must be screened out. This is not only a philosophical argument, but one
with significant practical consequences as shown by the attribute distribution curves
in Fig. 19-13.

Both the screened population and the controlled population meet the acceptance
criteria in that no parts fall below the lower limit, denoted as L in the figure. However,
in the screened population a much larger fraction of the total population is near the
lower limit than in the controlled population. Environmental effects and aging cause a
dispersion of the attributes, and therefore will cause a larger fraction of the screened
population to fall below the lower limit than in the controlled population. This effect
can be compensated for by selecting an initial acceptance limit that is higher than the
lowest value that can be tolerated in service. Where articles are procured specifically

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 777

for space applications, costs will be reduced if the process can be improved so that
only a small portion of the product will be rejected in screening.

19.2.3 Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance protects against a wider spectrum of failure modes than fault avoid-
ance. In most cases it also requires much more resources. A summary of the suitability
and limitations of representative fault tolerance techniques is shown in Table 19-8.

TABLE 19-8. Representative Fault Tolerance Techniques.

Same Design Redundancy | Random failures High production cost, weight
Diverse Design Redundancy | Random and design failures | Same, plus design and logistic cost

k-out-of-n Redundancy Random failures Applicable only where multiple
copies of an article are present
Functional Redundancy Random and design failures | Diverse methods to accomplish a
function must be available
Temporal Redundancy Transient, intermittent Time required for recovery
failures

By scope of redundancy, we mean the size and importance of the entity that is being
made redundant. Paralleling two relay contacts is a redundancy provision of very small
scope, and dual telemetry systems represent redundancy of large scope. In Fig. 19-14
the single system line shows the reliability of a single element with MTBF of one time
unit. The system redundancy curve shows the resulting reliability if two of these ele-
ments are operated in parallel. The partitioned redundancy curve refers to the original
(single) system being divided into quarters, and then each quarter made redundant.
The redundant and the quarter-partitioned curve involve (at least superficially) the
same resources (in each case twice those of the single system), and yet the quarter
configuration has a pronounced reliability advantage, particularly at the longer time
intervals. It would therefore seem that redundancy of small scope is to be preferred
over that of large scope.

In practice, the switching or voting provisions that are required for each partition
can add considerably to the cost of the implementation, and since they are not likely
to be 100% reliable they may also reduce the reliability benefits. System test can also
be adversely impacted by redundancy of small scope. The system redundancy (middle
curve in the figure) requires only two tests. The quarter redundancy requires 16 tests
if all combinations are to be covered. Selecting the scope of redundancy must consider
the means of failure detection, the ease of output switching or combining, the reliabil-
ity gains that can be achieved, and the cost of implementation and test.

Same Design Redundancy

Same design redundancy involves installation of two or more identical components
together with switching to make one of them active. In a few instances, particularly for
power supplies, the outputs can be combined so that switching is not necessary. Voting
can also be used for combining outputs of redundant units but this carries a high cost
because at least three identical units have to be installed to make it practicable. Same
design redundancy offers very high protection against random failures, and the

benefits do not depend on knowledge of failure modes. It is not very effective against
failures due to design deficiencies: if one component fails due to insufficient radiation
hardness, the redundant one is very likely to fail soon thereafter. Because of the high
cost, same design redundancy is used only sparingly in low cost satellites.

The cost of same design redundancy can sometimes be reduced by employing
k-out-of-n replacement, in which a pool of spares can be assigned to replace any one
of the pool of active units. An example is bulk memory (for data storage) which usu-
ally consists of multiple physically identical modules. Providing one or more spare
modules on the same data bus permits replacement of any one failed module. The same
scheme can be used for multi-cell batteries, solar panels, and other elements of the
electric power supply.

Diverse Design Redundancy

Installation of two or more components of different design (called diverse design
redundancy) to furnish the same service has two advantages: it offers high protection
against failures due to design deficiencies, and it can offer lower cost if the back-up
unit is a “lifeboat,” with lower accuracy and functionality, but still adequate for the
minimum mission needs. The installation of diverse units usually adds to logistic cost
because of additional test specifications, fixtures, and spare parts. This form of redun-

19.2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 7719

dancy is economical primarily where the back-up unit comes from a previous satellite
design, or where there is experience with it from another source. Where there is con-
cern about the design integrity of a primary component, diverse design redundancy
may have to be employed regardless of cost.

Functional and Temporal Redundancy

Functional redundancy (sometimes called analytic redundancy) involves furnish-
ing a service by diverse means. An example is the determination of attitude rate from
a rate gyro assembly (direct), and from observation of celestial bodies (indirect). It is
particularly advantageous when the alternate is already installed for another service,
e.g., if a star sensor is provided for navigation. In these cases the only cost incurred is
for the switching provisions and for data conversion. Both of these can frequently be
achieved in an existing onboard computer, thus further minimizing the cost.

Functional redundancy can also take the form of a ground back-up for functions
preferably performed autonomously, e.g., navigation, thermal control, or furnishing
commands for sensor operation. In the communication subsystem there are frequently
omni-directional and directional antenna systems. For some satellite missions these
may also be considered a form of functional redundancy.

The chief benefits of analytic redundancy are: (1) it avoids the cost and weight
penalties of physical redundancy, and (2) it is inherently diverse, thus providing
protection against design faults. The major limitation is that the back-up provisions
usually entail lower performance.

Temporal redundancy involves repetition of an unsuccessful operation. A common
example is a retry after a failure within the computing process. The same technique is
applicable to acquisition of a star, firing of a pyrotechnic device, or communication
with the ground. This is obviously a low cost technique. It is most effective when the
design incorporates an analysis of the optimum retry interval and of changes that may
improve the success of later operations, e.g., switching a power supply, reducing loads
on the power supply, or re-orientation of the satellite. The most important step is to
plan ahead for retry of operations and to incorporate “hooks” that permit automatic or
ground-initiated retry.

19.2.4 Test Techniques

The least expensive reliability test is one that is not run at all as a reliability test, but
rather as a part of a qualification test, lot acceptance test for purchased parts, or as an
acceptance test on the spacecraft as a whole or on a major subsystem. To use these
activities for reliability assessment may require some additional instrumentation and
sometimes an extension of the test time, but these are very small resource expenditures
compared to those required for even a modest separately run reliability test.

Other alternatives to obtaining reliability data by test are:

* Using test data obtained by others (including vendors) on the same component
* Using test or experience data on similar components
¢ Stress-strength analysis (particularly for mechanical components)
* Reliability prediction by MIL-HDBK-217 or similar sources
One of the greatest problems with reliability tests is that the results are usually

obtained after many months or even years of test. Once it has been decided that a
reliability test is necessary, a suitable scope and test environment must be selected.

780 Space Manufacturing and Reliability 19.2

The scope designates the assembly level; parts and circuit boards usually being desig-
nated as small scope, while subsystem and system level tests represent a large scope.
Advantages of small scope tests are:

« Low cost and small size of individual test articles permit testing of multiple
items

* Inputs and outputs are easily accessible
¢ The test environment can be tailored to the requirements of the unit under test
¢ The test can be conducted early because it does not require integration.

Advantages of large scope tests are:
¢ Interactions between components can be observed
¢ Test results are easily translated to effects on the mission.

The test environment can be quiescent (room ambient) or stressed. Advantages of
testing in a quiescent environment are:

¢ Low cost (no or only simple environmental chambers required)
* Articles under test are easily accessible
* No induction of failures due to unusually high stress

Advantages of a stressed environment are:
* Increased probability of failure (less test time required)
¢ Can identify environmental vulnerability of the unit under test.

The attributes of the approaches lead to the test recommendations shown in
Table 19-9.

TABLE 19-9. Typical Uses of Reliability Testing.

Small Scope Large Scope

Quiescent Suitability test High risk

Environment Critical components—failure inducing stress unknown subsystems

Stressed Critical components—failure inducing stress known

Reliability testing at large scope and in a stressed environment is very expensive
and is rarely warranted.

The time required for any reliability test can be significantly reduced if testing by
variables is employed. This means that the value of significant attributes is numer-
ically recorded (as contrasted with the commonly used pass/fail procedure). From
these data, the distribution of parameters can be plotted, and the probability of drop-
ping below an acceptance criterion can be assessed. The general technique is similar
to the one described in the Screening Techniques section. For reliability assessment
the parameter distributions are of interest, whereas in screening the attributes of
individual units are the chief criterion.

The small component populations that are typical of space procurements preclude
the use of conventional reliability demonstration methods. Even a modest subsystem
requirement, such as reliability of 0.95 for 17,000 hours (approximately 2 years),

19,2 Reliability for Space Mission Planning 781

corresponds to an MTBF of over 330,000 hours and will require over 1 million
component-hours of test to arrive at a statistically meaningful assessment by con-
ventional methods. Yet, experimental verification of the claimed reliability of a
component or subsystem is frequently desirable and sometimes required. The follow-
ing paragraphs explore low cost methods of accomplishing this.

The major causes of failures are workmanship and design. The first of these can be
controlled by quality assurance. Design failures occur primarily because the strength
of a component is not adequate for the environment in which it is used, or because the
manufacturing process permits too much variability in component characteristics. This
is most easily seen in mechanical spacecraft components where reliability depends on
(a) the margin between the nominal (mean) strength of the component and the
maximum service load and (b) the variability of strength about the mean in the
delivered product. Since test can characterize the strength of mechanical components
fairly easily, strength-load margins (design margins) have always played a major role
in their reliability assessment. For electrical and electronic components the same rela-
tionship holds in principle, but it is usually much harder to define a single failure
inducing stress or load. Nevertheless, test data can give valuable insights into potential
reliability problems. Important requirements are (a) recording of test results in numer-
ical form (not pass/fail), and (b) statistical evaluation of the probability of failure
derived from the numerical test results, e.g. by applying the 60 criterion (the mean
value of a parameter is at least six standard deviations above the specified minimum
or below the specified maximum) [Harry, 1997]. The tests from which the required
data are obtained need not be specific reliability tests. Typically they are the qualifica-
tion test and acceptance tests.
