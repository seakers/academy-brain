Over the past four decades the engineering design of spacecraft has evolved from
infancy to well-defined techniques supported by analysis tools, manufacturing
technology, and space-qualified hardware. This chapter summarizes these techniques,
with emphasis on the conceptual design of the spacecraft vehicle. The following two
chapters present more detailed design and manufacturing information. To design a
spacecraft, we must understand the mission, including the payload’s size and charac-
teristics, plus significant system constraints such as orbit, lifetime, and operations. We
then configure a space vehicle to carry the payload equipment and provide the
functions necessary for mission success. The design process shown in Table 10-1
involves identifying these functions, choosing candidate approaches for each function,
and selecting the best approaches. This chapter presents design methods with rules of
thumb that will help us roughly estimate the spacecraft design [Agrawal, 1986; Chetty,
1991; Griffin and French, 1991}.

An unmanned spacecraft consists of at least three elements: a payload, a spacecraft
bus, and a booster adapter. The payload is the mission-peculiar equipment or instru-
ments. The spacecraft bus carries the payload and provides housekeeping functions.
The payload and spacecraft bus may be separate modules, or the vehicle may be an
integrated design. The booster adapter provides the load-carrying interface with the
boost vehicle. The spacecraft may also have a propellant load and a propulsion kick
stage. The propellant, either compressed gas, liquid or solid fuel, is used for velocity
corrections and attitude control. A kick stage,” if used, is a separate rocket motor or
liquid stage used to inject the spacecraft into its mission orbit.

* Also called apogee boost motor, propulsion module, or integral propulsion stage.

The top-level requirements and constraints are dictated by the mission concept,
mission architecture, and by payload operation. For instance, the selection of orbit is
intimately tied to the selected mission and payload as described in Chaps. 6 and 7.
From a spacecraft design standpoint, the orbit also affects attitude control, thermal
design, and the electric power subsystem. However, most of these design effects are
secondary to the effect that the orbit can have on payload performance. The designer
therefore selects the orbit based on mission and payload performance, and computes
the required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing, thermal control,
power quantity, and duty cycle. The spacecraft is then sized to meet these require-
ments. We can summarize succinctly the spacecraft bus functions: support the payload
mass; point the payload correctly; keep the payload at the right temperature; provide
electric power, commands, and telemetry; put the payload in the right orbit and keep
it there; and provide data storage and communications, if required. The spacecraft bus
consists of subsystems or equipment groups which provide these functions. Table 10-2
lists the somewhat arbitrary definitions of subsystems used here and in Chap. 11. The
table also includes alternate terminology and groupings you may encounter, along
with references to more detailed information. Sometimes the payload is also treated as
a subsystem. Chapters 9 and 13 discuss payload design.

The propulsion subsystem provides thrust for changing the spacecraft’s transla-
tional velocity or applying torques to change its angular momentum. The simplest
spacecraft do not require thrust and hence have no propulsion equipment. But most
spacecraft need some controlled thrust, so their design includes some form of metered
propulsion—a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments.
We use thrusting to change orbital parameters, correct velocity errors, maneuver,
counter disturbance forces (e.g., drag), control attitude during thrusting, and control
and correct angular momentum. The equipment in the propulsion subsystem includes
a propellant supply (propellant, tankage, distribution system, pressurant, and propel-
lant controls) and thrusters or engines. Compressed gasses, such as nitrogen, and
liquids, such as monopropellant hydrazine, are common propellants. Significant sizing
parameters for the subsystem are the total impulse and the number, orientation, and
thrust levels of the thrusters. Chapter 17 describes design and equipment for propul-
sion subsystems.

The attitude determination and control subsystem measures and controls the
spacecraft’s angular orientation (pointing direction), or, in the case of a guidance,
navigation, and control system, both its orientation and linear velocity (which affects
its orbit). The simplest spacecraft are either uncontrolled or achieve control by passive

methods such as spinning or interacting with the Earth’s magnetic or gravity fields.
These may or may not use sensors to measure the attitude or position. More complex
systems employ controllers to process the spacecraft attitude, and actuators, torquers,
or propulsion subsystem thrusters to change attitude, velocity, or angular momentum.
Spacecraft may have several bodies or appendages, such as solar arrays or communi-
cation antennas, that require individual attitude pointing. To control the appendages’
attitude, we use actuators, sometimes with separate sensors and controllers. The
capability of the attitude control subsystem depends on the number of body axes and
appendages to be controlled, control accuracy and speed of response, maneuvering
requirements, and the disturbance environment. Section 11.1 discusses design of the
attitude determination and control subsystem.

The communications subsystem links the spacecraft with the ground or other
spacecraft. Information flowing to the spacecraft (uplink or forward link) consists of
commands and ranging tones. Information flowing from the spacecraft (downlink or
return link) consists of status telemetry and ranging tones and may include payload
data. The basic communication subsystem consists of a receiver, a transmitter, and a
wide-angle (hemispheric or omnidirectional) antenna. Systems with high data rates
may also use a directional antenna. The communications subsystem receives and
demodulates commands, modulates and transmits telemetry and payload data, and
receives and retransmits range tones—modulation that allows signal turnaround time
delay and hence range to be measured. The subsystem may also provide coherence
between uplink and downlink signals, allowing us to measure range-rate Doppler
shifts. We size the communications subsystem by data rate, allowable error rate,
communication path length, and RF frequency. Section 11.2 and Chap. 13 discuss
design of the communications subsystem.


304 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.1

The command and data handling subsystem distributes commands and accu-
mulates, stores, and formats data from the spacecraft and payload. For simpler
systems, we combine these functions with the communications subsystem as a track-
ing, telemetry, and command subsystem. This arrangement assumes that distributing
commands and formatting telemetry are baseband extensions of communications
modulation and demodulation. In its more general form, the subsystem includes a
central processor (computer), data buses, remote interface units, and data storage units
to implement its functions. It may also handle sequenced or programmed events. For
the most part, data volume and data rate determine the subsystem’s size. Section 11.3
discusses subsystem design, and Chap. 16 covers computers and software.

The power subsystem provides electric power for the equipment on the spacecraft
and payload. It consists of a power source (usually solar cells), power storage (batter-
ies), and power conversion and distribution equipment. The power needed to operate
the equipment and the power duty cycle determine the subsystem’s size, but we must
also consider power requirements during eclipses and peak power consumption.
Because solar cells and batteries have limited lives, our design must account for power
requirements at beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL). Section 11.4 discusses
design of the power subsystem.

The thermal subsystem controls the spacecraft equipment’s temperatures. It does so
by the physical arrangement of equipment and using thermal insulation and coatings to
balance heat from power dissipation, absorption from the Earth and Sun, and radiation
to space. Sometimes passive, thermal-balance techniques are not enough. In this case,
electrical heaters and high-capacity heat conductors, or heat pipes, actively control
equipment temperatures. The amount of heat dissipation and temperatures required for
equipment to operate and survive determine the subsystem’s size. Section 11.5
discusses temperature control in more detail.

The structural subsystem carries, supports, and mechanically aligns the spacecraft
equipment. It also cages and protects folded components during boost and deploys
them in orbit. The main load-carrying structure, or primary structure, is sized by either
(1) the strength needed to carry the spacecraft mass through launch accelerations and
transient events during launch or (2) stiffness needed to avoid dynamic interaction
between the spacecraft and the launch vehicle structures. Secondary structure, which
consists of deployables and supports for components is designed for compact packag-
ing and convenience of assembly. Section 11.6 discusses structural design.

10.1 Requirements, Constraints, and the Design Process

In designing spacecraft, we begin by developing baseline requirements and
constraints such as those in Table 10-3. If some of the information is not available, we
may need to assume values or use typical values such as those presented here or in the
following chapters. For successful design, we must document all assumptions and
revisit them until we establish an acceptable baseline.

To get a feel for the size and complexity of a spacecraft design, we must understand
the space mission: its concept of operations, duration, overall architecture, and con-
straints on cost and schedule. Even if we select a mission concept arbitrarily from
several good candidates, clearly defining it allows us to complete the spacecraft design
and evaluate its performance.

The payload is the single most significant driver of spacecraft design. Its physical
parameters—size, weight, and power—dominate the physical parameters of the

spacecraft. Payload operations and support are key requirements for the spacecraft’s
subsystems, as well. The payload may also impose significant special requirements
that drive the design approach, such as cryogenic temperatures or avoidance of con-
tamination. Fortunately, we often understand the payload’s characteristics better than
the spacecraft’s overall characteristics in the early design phases. Thus, we can infer
many important design features by understanding the payload and how it operates.

Chapters 6 and 7 show how orbital characteristics affect the mission. In spacecraft
design, the orbit affects propulsion, attitude control, thermal design, and the electric
power subsystem. Most of these design effects are secondary to the orbit’s effect on
payload performance. Therefore, we select the orbit based on mission and payload per-
formance. Then we compute the performance characteristics needed for the spacecraft,
such as pointing, thermal control, and power quantity and duty cycle. Finally, we size
the spacecraft to meet these needs.

The natural space environment—especially radiation—limits two aspects of space-
craft design: usable materials or piece parts, and spacecraft lifetime. Radiation levels
and dose must be considered in the design, but they do not normally affect the system’s
configuration or ability. Chapter 8 provides useful space environment information.
However, some types of hostile (weapon) environments may affect countermeasures,
configuration, shielding, or maneuvering ability.

Selecting a boost vehicle and the possible use of kick stages are central issues in
designing a spacecraft. We must select a booster that can put at least the minimum
version of our spacecraft into its required orbit. Chapter 18 describes available boost-
ers, all of which have limited weight-lifting ability. In most cases, we must extrapolate
published data to meet our mission requirements. Chapters 6 and 7 present the laws of
orbital mechanics and the techniques of trajectory design. These include methods for
computing velocity increments and guidance techniques. In some cases, the spacecraft
must provide large amounts of velocity just to reach orbit or to guide the flight path.
Chapter 17 presents performance characteristics for solid and liquid propulsion kick
stages to implement these functions. Common nomenclature for a kick stage used to
inject a spacecraft into transfer orbit is a perigee kick motor (PKM), whereas a kick
stage used to circularize at high altitude is called an apogee kick motor (AKM).

The booster selection will also affect a spacecraft’s linear dimensions. An aerody-
namic cover, called a fairing, or shroud, protects the spacecraft as it travels through
the atmosphere. The fairing’s diameter and length limit the spacecraft’ s size—at least
while it is attached to the booster. Chapter 18 presents the size of standard fairings for
various boosters. If the on-orbit spacecraft is larger than the fairing, it must be folded
or stowed to fit within the fairing and unfolded or deployed on orbit. To design an item
with a large area but small intrinsic mass, such as a solar array or antenna, we make
the item as light as possible, fold it and protect it during boost, and deploy it (unfold,
pull, or stretch it into shape) on orbit. Solar cells may rest on lightweight substrates or
even on film that is folded or rolled for storage. Antenna reflectors have consisted of
folded rigid panels or of fabric, either film or mesh. Thus, we meet the launch vehicle’s
demands for a smaller spacecraft by using a stowed configuration and then deploying
the spacecraft to meet the full size needed on orbit. We use weight efficiently by
caging and protecting the light-weight deployables during boost.

The ground system interface determines how much ground operators and the space-
craft can interact—an important part of design. The periods of visibility between
ground stations and the spacecraft limit ground control of spacecraft operations or
corrections of errant behavior. Visibility periods and ground coverage issues are

10.1 Requirements, Constraints, and the Design Process 307

described in Chap. 5. If ground operations cost too much, we may want the spacecraft
to operate autonomous] y—another major design decision.

Table 10-4 lists initial configuration decisions or trade-offs designers often face.
Weight, size, and power requirements for the payload place lower limits on
spacecraft’s weight, size, and power. The spacecraft’s overall size may depend on such
payload parameters as antenna size or optical system diameter. Our approach to space-
craft design must match these dimensions and provide fields of view appropriate to the
payload functions. The spacecraft must generate enough power to satisfy the payload
needs as well as its own requirements. The amount of power and the duty cycle will
dictate the size and shape of solar arrays and the requirements for the battery.

trades is in Sec. 10.2.

Field-of-view and pointing considerations influence how we configure the space-
craft. Instruments, sensors, solar arrays, and thermal radiators all have pointing and
field-of-view requirements that must be satisfied by their mounting on the spacecraft
and the spacecraft’s orientation. In the simplest case, all items are fixed to the body,
and control of the body’s attitude points the field of view. In more complex cases,
single or two-degree-of-freedom mechanisms articulate the field of view.

We must also establish how to configure the spacecraft’s propulsion early in the
design process. Although interaction with the Earth’s gravity or magnetic field can
control attitude, it cannot change the spacecraft’s velocity state. If spacecraft velocity
control is needed, some form of metered propulsion must be used. If we decide to use
metered propulsion, we should look at using this system for such functions as attitude
control or as an orbit transfer stage. Most attitude-control systems use metered pro-

pulsion to exert external torque on the spacecraft. Selecting a propulsion approach
depends on the total impulse requirement, and the propulsion system’s performance,
as discussed in Chap. 17.

10.2 Spacecraft Configuration

To estimate the size and structure of a spacecraft, we select a design approach,
develop a spacecraft configuration (overall arrangement) and make performance
allocations to the spacecraft subsystems. We then evaluate the resulting design and
reconfigure or reallocate as needed. Subsequent iterations add design detail and pro-
vide better allocations. The process of allocating design requirements involves two
mutually supporting techniques. First, the allocated design requirements are dictated
by considering the overall spacecraft design—a top-down approach. Alternatively, the
allocated design requirements are developed by gathering detailed design informa-
tion—a bottom-up approach. For instance, we may allocate 100 kg for structural
weight based on 10% of the overall spacecraft weight. This is a top-down allocation.
However, a detailed design of the structure may require 120 kg if aluminum is used
and 90 kg if composites are used. These are bottom-up allocations, providing us with
the opportunity to trade off alternatives and reallocate requirements to optimize the
design. Most of the allocation methods presented in this chapter are top-down. They
provide a starting point for the allocation process. However, we should use them in
conjunction with bottom-up design from the more detailed information given in
Chaps. 11, 16, and 17.

Figure 10-1 shows different spacecraft configurations. First, observe that each of
these spacecraft has a central body or equipment compartment that houses most of the
spacecraft equipment. Second, note that these spacecraft all have solar arrays either
mounted on external panels or on the skin of the equipment compartment. And finally
note that some of the spacecraft have appendages carrying instruments or antennas
attached to the main compartment. Let’s examine each of these configuration features
in more detail.

Table 10-5 lists the factors called configuration drivers leading to the various
configurations. The weight, size and shape of the payload, and the boost vehicle diam-
eter drive the size and shape of the equipment compartment. Table 10-5 also presents
rules of thumb based on analysis of a large number of spacecraft designs. This analysis
shows that the average spacecraft bus dry weight (spacecraft weight excluding propel-
lant) is approximately twice that of the payload. The minimum spacecraft bus dry
weight is equal to the payload weight and is achieved only when the payload is
massive and compact. At the other extreme, low-density payloads or those consisting
of multiple instruments can lead to a spacecraft bus as massive as 6 times the payload.
Although this is a large range of possible spacecraft bus weights, these ratios are at
least a bound. Section 10.3 shows how to refine the estimate.

The spacecraft equipment compartment volume can be estimated from its weight.
For 75 spacecraft launched between 1975 and 1984, the average spacecraft in launch
configuration with propellant loaded and all appendages folded had a density of only
79 kg/m> with a maximum of 172 kg/m} and a minimum of 20 kg/m3. However,
appendages are usually lightweight, so the weight of the equipment compartment is
only slightly less than the total spacecraft weight. We can use this experience to esti-
mate the spacecraft size (volume and dimensions) by the steps shown in Table 10-6.
We start with payload weight to obtain an estimate of spacecraft bus weight (e.g.,

twice payload weight) and add an estimate of propellant weight (see Sec. 10.3) to yield
spacecraft loaded weight. We now use an estimated density (e.g., 79 kg/m) to
compute the spacecraft volume. We select an equipment compartment shape and
dimensions to provide this volume, match the payload dimensions, and fit within the
booster diameter.

Usually, a spacecraft in folded launch configuration is cylindrically symmetric,
mounted on the booster with the axis of symmetry parallel to the thrust axis. The
folded spacecraft diameter is designed to fit within the boost vehicle diameter although
on rare occasions a bulbous fairing may be used to provide a slightly larger diameter.
(Bulbous fairings are generally avoided because they detract from booster perfor-
mance.) Since the equipment compartment diameter is approximately the same as the
folded spacecraft diameter, we can use the booster diameter as an upper limit for the
equipment compartment diameter and select a compartment shape to fit within this
diameter. Knowing its volume, we can readily compute the compartment’s length.

spacecraft compartment shapes.

Spacecraft solar arrays are of two types: body mounted and panel mounted. Exam-
ples of both types are shown in Fig. 10-1. An array produces about 100 W/m? of
projected solar cell area. This is unregulated power and represents an array efficiency
of 7%. To use this rule of thumb, we need to estimate the total spacecraft power, as

10.2 Spacecraft Configuration 313

described in Sec. 10.3. However for initial configuration selection, we need only
bound the power requirements and see if there is sufficient area on the equipment
compartment to allow body-mounted cells. At a minimum, power must be provided
for the payload. Prudent design would also make some allowance for spacecraft bus
power and battery recharge power which are discussed in more detail in Sec. 10.3. If
there is insufficient area on the spacecraft body for a body-mounted array, then we are
forced to use panels.

Evaluation of pointing and attitude control on spacecraft configuration starts with
identifying all pointing requirements (see Table 10-13) for both the spacecraft bus and
payload. The process of synthesizing a control approach to meet these requirements is
discussed in Sec. 10.4.2. Although we must go through this process in detail to see the
full effect of pointing on the spacecraft configuration, the basic implications can be
derived by the process and rules of thumb in Table 10-5. The spacecraft configuration
must provide 2 axes of control for each item that is to be pointed. The spacecraft body
has 3 axes so the body alone can satisfy one pointing requirement; for instance, one
body axis (i.e., the yaw axis) can be pointed toward nadir by control about the other 2
axes (roll and pitch). If two items are to be pointed, then the spacecraft must be
configured with at least one articulated joint between the two items. For illustration, a
body-mounted antenna can be pointed toward nadir by controlling 2 axes of body
attitude. A solar array can then simultaneously be pointed toward the Sun by using the
third body axis and providing a single axis solar array drive to control the solar array
attitude relative to the body. This approach is called yaw steering (see OGO,
Fig. 10-1C). If the spacecraft has a second item that must point in another direction
(say, an antenna that must point toward a communication relay satellite), then the
configuration must provide 2 more axes of control. The TDRS spacecraft shown in Fig
10-1B has 3 separate articulated antennas with a total of 6 mechanical axes of control
in addition to 3 axes of body attitude control and 1 axis of solar array control. DSP,
shown in Fig 10-1B, has a body-mounted payload and uses control of two body axes
to point toward nadir. The third body axis is used to scan the payload field-of-view. A
communication antenna is articulated about 2 axes to point toward a ground station,
and although solar array panels are used to augment the solar array area, the array is
not articulated.

Spin stabilization is a particularly simple and robust method of attitude control.
Satellites that employ spin stabilization are often cylindrical, such as DSCS II shown
in Fig 10-1A. For such a satellite, the spin axis supplies 1 axis of control by using a
motor-driven platform that is despun (spinning in a negative sense relative to the
satellite body). This is sometimes called a dual-spin system.. Equipment mounted on
the despun platform can be articulated about additional axes to achieve further point-
ing capability.

The attitude contro] method may also interact with the solar array configuration.
Solar panels may be body-fixed such as Explorer VI and DSP, or they may be articu-
lated, as shown on OGO and TDRS in Fig. 10-1. Spin-stabilized spacecraft usually
have body-fixed arrays, and 3-axis-controlled spacecraft generally use articulated
panels. The power generated by a solar array is proportional to the area that intercepts
sunlight (the projected area). A planar array which is pointed toward the Sun has a
ratio of total array area to projected area of one. A cylindrical array which has its
axis perpendicular to the Sun line has a ratio of 1/7 and an array which projects equal
area in all directions has a ratio of 1/4. The method of solar array pointing control and
the type of array selected therefore affect the total array area.

314 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.3

Sometimes a spacecraft configuration is driven to use long booms either to control
spacecraft moment of inertia or to separate delicate instruments from the spacecraft
body electrical fields. GEOSAT, shown in Fig. 10-1C, uses a boom to increase the
moment of inertia and provide gravity-gradient attitude stabilization, a passive attitude
control technique described in Sec. 11.1. OGO, also shown in Fig.10-1C, uses booms
to isolate payload magnetometers from the spacecraft body.

10.3 Design Budgets

We begin allocating performance by establishing budgets* or allocations for
propellant, power, weight, and reliability. We can derive the propellant budget by
estimating the propellant requirements for velocity changes (orbit correction and
maintenance) and attitude control. At first, we estimate the power budget by adding
the payload’s power requirements to power estimates for the spacecraft bus
subsystems. To derive the first weight budget for the spacecraft, we add the payload
weight to estimates for the spacecraft bus, including propulsion components and
power components. We make the initial reliability budget by defining the probability
of achieving acceptable spacecraft performance and lifetime.

A typical propellant budget as shown in Table 10-7 contains four elements: veloc-
ity-control propellant, attitude-control propellant, margin, and residual. The velocity-
correction requirement is expressed as total velocity change or AV, which is obtained
from Sec. 7.3. Chapter 17 presents the rocket equation Eq. (17-21) by which we
convert velocity change to propellant mass. Attitude-control propellant is used for spin
stabilization and maneuvering while spinning, countering disturbance torques (in-
cluding control during AV thrusting), attitude maneuvering, and limit cycling or
oscillation. Formulas for these entries are presented in Sec. 10.4.2 and summarized in
Table 10-7. Propellant margin is a percentage of the identified propellant requirement,
typically 25% for preliminary design. 1% or 2% is unavailable propellant.

Table 10-8 outlines the three steps for estimating spacecraft power requirements.
First, we prepare an operating power budget by estimating the power required by the
payload and the spacecraft subsystems. If the spacecraft has several operating modes
that differ in power requirements, we must budget separately for each mode, paying
particular attention to peak power needs for each subsystem. The second step is battery
sizing, or selecting the battery capacity appropriate to the spacecraft power require-
ments and battery cycle life. With size established, we can compute the battery’s
recharge power. The third step is accounting for power-subsystem degradation over
the mission life by computing radiation damage to the solar array.

Table 10-9 lists references that discuss operating power for the payload and the
spacecraft bus subsystems, and shows typical percentages of the operating power
budget devoted to each subsystem. These percentages change with the spacecraft’s
total power use, so I have presented ranges for a minimum (<100 W), a small (200 W),
and a medium to large spacecraft (S00—10,000 W). We can use these values as a start-
ing point if we do not have more information, but Sec. 10.6 and Chap. 11 give specific
examples of various power requirements.

Sections 10.4.6 and 11.3 discuss battery recharge power. At the minimum, the
recharge energy must exceed the energy drawn from the battery during discharge by
an amount that accounts for the efficiency of the charge-discharge process (typically
80%). Most batteries also require recharge at a minimum rate—specified as a fraction
of battery capacity (typically 1/15). These two requirements translate into recharge
power ranging from 7% of the discharge power for geosynchronous orbits to 60% for
low-altitude orbits.

The solar array must supply enough power for operations and recharging the
battery unti] end-of-life. The beginning-of-life power requirement must allow for
degradation in the solar array. As Sec. 11.4 points out, this degradation depends on
orbit altitude and radiation environment, but 30% is typical for 10 years at geosyn-
chronous altitude. We can assume the same value for altitudes of 800 km or less.
Between these altitudes the degradation is much larger.

Table 10-10 shows the build-up of spacecraft weight. As pointed out in Sec. 10.2,
the ratio of spacecraft dry weight to payload weight lies in the range of 2:1 to 7:1; the
payload weight is typically less than half the spacecraft dry weight and may be as little

as 15% of the dry weight. Spacecraft structure weight generally falls in the range of
15% to 25% of spacecraft dry weight (see Appendix A). Spacecraft structural weight
may also be estimated at 8% to 12% of injected weight (dry weight + propellant +
injection stage). Spacecraft thermal subsystem weight is between 2% and 5% of space-
craft dry weight. Weight percentages for other subsystems vary widely and require
more detailed investigation. (See Sec. 10.4.3, Chaps. 11 and 17.) To account for
uncertainties during preliminary design we add 25% to these weights for new equip-
ment and 5% or less for known hardware. We should hold a small allowance (1% to
2%) at the system level to account for integration hardware, such as brackets and
mounting hardware, which are often overlooked.

Assuming independent, serial operation, hardware
failure rate is generally evaluated by summing
piece part failure rates. (See Chap. 19 and
MIL-HDBK-17 [1991].) Failure mode analysis

and elimination are discussed in Sec. 10.4. Effect
of failures can be reduced and reliability raised by
changing the design, selecting more reliable
hardware, or adding redundant hardware and
software.

From the start of the spacecraft design we must design our hardware and software

to achieve reliable operation. The process of design-for-reliability starts in the con-
ceptual design phase with the determination of system reliability requirements and
allocation of these requirements to the spacecraft subsystems. This is a four-part
process as shown in Table 10-11. First, we establish the mission success criteria,
which is a list of events and operations that together constitute success. Second, we
assign a numerical probability to meeting each element of the mission success criteria
and select a set of ground rules for computing the probability of success. Third, we
allocate reliability requirements to all spacecraft hardware and software. Fourth, we

318 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

evaluate system reliability and iterate the design to maximize the reliability assess-
ment, and identify and eliminate failure modes. (See Secs. 10.5.2 and 19.2 for further
discussions of reliability.)

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus

10.4.1 Propulsion Subsystem

The propulsion equipment for a spacecraft includes tankage to hold the propellant,
lines and pressure-regulating equipment, and the engines or thrusters. Common
propellants are pressurized gas such as nitrogen, selected monopropellants such as
hydrazine, and bipropellants. The pressurized feed systems typically used may be
pressure regulated or blow down. Important design parameters are the number, orien-
tation, and location of the thrusters; the thrust level; and the amount of impulse
required. Chapter 17 discusses the design of propulsion subsystems and characteristics
of propulsion components.

The propulsion tanks rest at or near the spacecraft’s center of mass to avoid shifting
of the center of mass as the propellant is used. Engines for translational control are
aligned to thrust through the center of mass, whereas engines for attitude control thrust
tangentially and are mounted as far away from the center of mass as possible to
increase the lever arm and thus increase the torque per unit thrust. Attitude control
engines which fire in the direction of flight (along or in opposition to the velocity
vector) are generally used in pairs to produce a pure torque without net linear force.
However, the spacecraft flight path is less sensitive to thrust at right angles to the
velocity vector and single attitude control engines are sometimes used in these
directions. Three-axis control requires a minimum of 6 attitude control thrusters, and
many designs use 8 to 12 plus backup units for reliability.

Table 10-12 gives weight and power estimates for the propulsion subsystem.
Chapter 17 gives more detailed weights and Sec. 10.6 offers examples of integrated
designs. The propulsion subsystem does not use much electrical power unless it
employs thrusters with heated catalyst beds, heated thrusters, or electric propulsion.
Electric propulsion is rare, but heated thrusters are common. Propulsion lines and
tanks must be protected from freezing, usually by thermostatically controlled guard
heaters. Power for these heaters is included in the thermal subsystem. Electrically
operated solenoid valves control propellant flow to the thrusters, but we account for
their power in the ADC subsystem.

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 319

10.4.2 Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem

Attitude control requirements are based on those for payload pointing and the
spacecraft bus pointing. Table 10-13 lists possible design requirements. If we must
control the attitude of all or part of the payload, we have to decide whether to point the
entire spacecraft or to articulate the payload or part of the payload. In the extreme case
of a scanning payload fixed to the spacecraft’s body, we must scan with the entire
spacecraft. Similar decisions are necessary for parts of the spacecraft that need orient-
ing in other directions such as pointing at the Sun.

Other Requirements:

Communications Antenna Pointing Toward a ground station or relay satellite

Pointing in a particular direction requires control of angular orientation about each
of the 2 axes perpendicular to the pointing axis. If, for example, a payload or antenna
must point toward the Earth, we need to control its attitude about 2 horizontal axes. If
the payload is fixed to the spacecraft’s body, these 2 axes are 2 of the 3 axes. Thus, we
can use the third axis—+otation about the pointing axis—to satisfy a second pointing
requirement, such as pointing one axis in the direction of flight. Table 10-14 lists types
of pointing systems.

Either spin stabilization or 3-axis control using sensors and torquers can be used to
control the spacecraft’s attitude. Spin stabilization divides into passive spin, spin with
precession control, or dual spin (spin with a despun platform). Classes of 3-axis
control depend on the sensor type or torquing method. Possible sensors include Earth,
Sun and star sensors, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and directional antennas. Torquers
include gravity gradient, magnetic, thrusters, and wheels. Wheels include variable
speed reaction wheels; momentum wheels, which have a nominal nonzero speed and
therefore provide angular momentum to the spacecraft; and control moment gyros,

320 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

which are fixed-speed gimballed wheels. Table 10-15 summarizes these methods of
control during thrusting and nonthrusting.

We use spin stabilization extensively for attitude control during kick-stage firing
and for small spacecraft. Spin-stabilized satellites with a despun platform, called a
dual spin system, frequently support communications payloads. In this case, we mount
the payload antenna on the despun platform so we can control its pointing. If the spin
axis is roughly perpendicular to the Sun line, we can mount solar cells on the space-
craft’s cylindrical skin to produce electric power.

Three-axis approaches range from passive control using gravity gradient or mag-
netics to full active control with propulsion thrusters and wheels. Passive techniques
can provide coarse control to support low-accuracy pointing requirements and simple
spacecraft. The active 3-axis method gives us highly accurate pointing control, more
efficient solar arrays (by allowing oriented planar arrays), and pointing of several
payloads or spacecraft appendages. But active 3-axis systems are more complex and

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 321

usually heavier than spin-stabilized ones, and we may need to consider both
approaches carefully before deciding between them. Table 10-16 summarizes how
various requirements affect this decision.

The guidance and navigation function on most spacecraft is a basic form of radio
guidance. It uses ground tracking to measure the flight path (or spacecraft ephemeris),
ground computing of desired velocity corrections, and command of the correction
through the communications and command subsystems. The direction of the velocity
correction is governed by the attitude control of the spacecraft body and the magnitude
is controlled by engine firing time. Two elements limit performance: ground-tracking
and spacecraft attitude-control during thrusting. The Global Positioning System (GPS)
may provide another way to measure the flight path. Coupled with an appropriate
guidance computer, a GPS receiver should be able to guide the boost phase and allow
the spacecraft to navigate autonomously in orbit, at least for low altitudes. Other
autonomous navigation methods are also available (see Sec. 11.7). Guiding spacecraft
to intercept or rendezvous usually requires a guidance radar, a gyroscope reference
assembly, and often accelerometers.

Accurate attitude control depends on the attitude sensors. Table 10-17 summarizes
what present sensors can do. Each sensor class is available in either a 1- or 2-axis
version. Magnetometers, Earth sensors, and Sun sensors are available in forms which
use the spin motion of a spinning spacecraft to scan the sensor’s field of view. Some
magnetometers and Earth and Sun sensors do not require scanning, but some highly
accurate Earth sensors use scanning detectors. Magnetometers apply only to altitudes
below about 6,000 km because the Earth’s magnetic field falls off rapidly with alti-
tude. Uncertainty in the Earth’s magnetic field and its variability with time limits the
accuracy of a magnetometer. In the same way, horizon uncertainty limits an Earth
sensor’s accuracy. Star sensors, however, allow us to measure attitude very accurately.
Most star sensors are too slow (typically several seconds) to control a spacecraft’s
attitude directly, so we normally use them with gyroscopes for high accuracy and rapid
response. Gyroscope accuracy is limited by instrument drift, so most gyroscope sys-
tems are used in conjunction with an absolute reference such as a star sensor or a
directional antenna.

After-the-fact processing can improve our knowledge of attitude. For example, we
can monitor the Earth’s magnetic field continuously and therefore partially correct the
variable effects of magnetic sensing. Variations in the Earth’s horizon tend to follow
a daily cycle, so we can apply some filtering correction.

322 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

improve accuracies in the future.

Accuracy Characteristics and Applicability

Magnetometers 1.0° (5,000 km ait) Attitude measured relative to Earth's local
5° (200 km alt) magnetic field. Magnetic field uncertainties
and variability dominate accuracy. Usable
only below ~6,000 km.

Earth Sensors 0.05 deg (GEO) Horizon uncertainties dominate accuracy.
0.1deg (low altitude) | Highly accurate units use scanning.

Sun Sensors 0.01 deg Typical field of view +130 deg.
Star Sensors 2 arc sec Typical field of view +16 deg.

Gyroscopes 0.001 deg/hr Normal use involves periodically resetting the
: reference position.

Directional Antennas 0.01deg to 0.5 deg Typically 1% of the antenna beamwidth.

The attitude-control system can also produce attitude motions which combine with
the attitude sensor’s accuracy to affect the total control accuracy. Control systems that
use thrusters alone require a dead zone to avoid continuous firing of the thrusters. The
control system’s accuracy is limited to half the dead-zone value plus the sensor
accuracy. Systems which use wheels (either speed-controlled reaction wheels or
gimballed constant-speed wheels) can avoid dead-zone attitude errors, so they usually
can operate close to the sensor accuracy.

Torquing methods for 3-axis-controlled spacecraft include gravity gradient, mag-
netic, thrusters, and wheels. Spacecraft using gravity-gradient and magnetic torquing
are clean and simple but do not provide high levels of control torque. We use thrusters
on most spacecraft because they produce large torque and can control the spacecraft’s
translational velocity as well as attitude. If the spacecraft must maneuver or suffers
cyclical disturbances, such as those at orbit rate or twice orbit rate (see Chap. 11), we
need to use wheels. A wheel can cyclically speed up or slow down, thus producing
maneuvering torque or counteracting disturbance torques. A wheel system consumes
less propellant than a thruster-only system because periodic effects do not require
propellant use. On the other hand, wheel systems are heavier and more complex than
those without wheels. Variable-speed reaction wheels produce only limited control
torque (less than 1 N+m). To obtain large values of cyclic torque, we use control
moment gyros—constant-speed wheels gimballed about an axis perpendicular to the
spin axis. These gyros can develop torques up to several thousand N+ m. When we need
more degrees of freedom or better pointing accuracy, we use mechanisms to point
spacecraft appendages, such as solar arrays or directional antennas.

Estimating Torque Requirements

One important sizing parameter for the control subsystem is its torque capability.
This capability, often called the control authority, must be large enough to counter-
balance disturbance torques and control the attitude during maneuvers and following
transient events such as spacecraft separation, deployment, and failure recovery.
These latter events usually size the torque requirement. The separation transient is
usually specified in terms of tip-off rate—the angular velocity, typically 0.1 to 1 deg/s,
imparted to the spacecraft at release from the booster. We size the attitude control
thrusters to capture or stabilize the spacecraft attitude before it has exceeded a speci-

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 323

fied value, as shown in Fig. 10-2A. The relation between required torque T, the tip-off
rate, @, (in rad/s), spacecraft moment of inertia, J,, and the maximum attitude excur-
sion, O9, (in rad), is:

T= 4,07 (Iy/ Omar) (10-1)
The torquing ability of a thruster system, a reaction wheel, a control moment gyro, or
a pointing mechanism may be set by an acceleration requirement such as that arising
from an attitude slew maneuver, shown in Fig 10-2B. The torque is simply 1, where I
is the moment of inertia and a is the acceleration. Sometimes the attitude maneuver is
specified as a change in angle of 9 in a time t,,,. The torque in this case is:

T =461/t,,7 (10-2)

As Fig. 10-2B shows, this is based on applying full accelerating torque for t,,,,/2 and
full decelerating torque for the remaining time.

The control torque required to stabilize a spacecraft during velocity-correction
firing of a rocket motor is the product of the rocket’s thrust level and the distance that
its line-of-action is offset from the spacecraft center-of-mass. This torque can be due
either to thruster misalignment or cg offset (see Table 10-18).

Estimating Angular Impulse for 3-Axis Control

Another major sizing parameter for the attitude control subsystem is the angular
impulse capability of its torquers. Angular impulse is the time integral of torque. For
thruster-produced torque, the angular impulse is related to the propellant mass ex-
pended. For reaction wheels and control moment gyros, the angular impulse is related
to wheel moment of inertia and speed. In all cases, angular impulse is related to control
system weight.

For 3-axis control systems, we calculate angular impulse by evaluating that needed
for attitude maneuvering, for counteracting the effects of disturbance torques, and for
oscillation or limit cycling. We determine the angular impulse required for man-
euvering from spacecraft moment of inertia and maneuver angular rate. The angular
impulse required to start an attitude maneuver L ya7_ is:

Lstart = 1s Oman (10-3)

where I, is spacecraft moment of inertia and @,,,, is the angular rate (rad/s) of the

maneuver. Stopping the maneuver requires an equal amount of angular impulse of
opposite polarity.

To compute angular impulse to cancel disturbance torques, we examine the
disturbances affecting the spacecraft as shown in Table 10-18. These disturbance
torques are all vector quantities. They can be expressed in any convenient system of
coordinates, although spacecraft body coordinates are generally used. For a given
spacecraft configuration, orbit, and spacecraft attitude, these torques can be computed
and integrated over the spacecraft lifetime. The result is the accumulated angular
impulse which, if uncontrolled, will disturb the spacecraft attitude. The control sub-
system must counteract these disturbance torques by applying control torque and the
control subsystem angular impulse capability must be at least equal to the disturbance
angular impulse.

In addition to the disturbance torques listed in Table 10-18, the control system may
be sized by the requirement to interchange momentum between spacecraft body axes
(sometimes referred to as Euler cross-coupling torque). Numerically this torque-like
effect is:

Ty =-Qx H, (10-4)

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 325

and comes about when the spacecraft dynamic equations are written in rotating
coordinates. T,, is the torque, Q is the angular velocity of the coordinate system, and
H, is the spacecraft angular momentum including that due to body rotation and
internal moving parts (such as reaction wheels). For a circular orbit and the dynamic
equations written in a coordinate system which rotates at orbit rate, the Euler cross-
coupling torques are of the same form as gravity-gradient torques and these effects are
often combined.

Note that, for any single axis, the disturbance torque may have cyclic terms that
integrate to zero over an integer number of cycles and secular terms that are not
periodic. Also note that angular impulse required for maneuvering is all cyclic. Reac-
tion wheels and control moment gyros can counteract cyclic torques by changing
speed or direction. If we use reaction wheels or control moment gyros (CMGs), we can
size them for the cyclic terms and counteract only the secular terms with thrusters. But
if we are designing a system that has no wheels or CMGs, we must expel propellant to
counteract all disturbances, and the angular impulse requirement is the sum of the time
integrals of the absolute value of disturbance torque computed about each axis. The
process of computing control system angular impulse from disturbance torques and
identifying cyclic and secular components is shown in Table 10-19.

Thruster control systems operate by pulsing a thruster when the attitude error
exceeds a set value known as the dead-zone limit. The thruster’s design determines the
length of the pulse—typically from 0.02 sec to 0.1 sec. The propellant consumption of
such a system is proportional to the size of the pulses and the rate of pulse firing. A
well designed control system will fire a minimum length pulse each time the dead-
zone limit is exceeded. The angular velocity change, A@, produced by a minimum
pulse Prin is:

AQ® = Phin / I, (10-5)
where P.

‘min = 1 5 tmin» T is thrust level of the thruster, s is the lever arm through
which the thruster works to produce torque, ¢,,;, is the minimum thruster firing time,
and I, is the spacecraft’s moment of inertia. The mean angular velocity of the space-
craft while in the dead-zone is A@/2 which implies that the spacecraft transverses
a dead-zone of 26, in 46,/Aq@ seconds. Since the pulse firing time is negligible rel-
ative to the time spent in traversing the dead-zone, the average impulse rate, IR, is one
minimum pulse every 40,/Aq@ seconds, or:

IR = P2,y in / (409 1;) (10-6)

The total angular impulse expended during the mission, L,,, is IR times mission
duration:

Lin = IR * mission duration (10-7)

The torque produced by a thruster is equal to its thrust T times its lever arm s. The
time integral of thrust is linear impulse and is related to the mass of propellant used by
the rocket equation (Eq. 17-6). An appropriate expression relating angular impulse to
propellant use is:

L=s| Tat =5 pgm, (10-8a)
or equivalently:

my = LI (5 Isp) (10-8b)

A reaction wheel produces torque by changing its speed. Its angular impulse
capability is equal to its moment of inertia times its maximum speed—its total angular
momentum. A control moment gyro produces torque by changing the direction of its
constant-speed momentum wheel. The angular impulse capability of a CMG is its
momentum (wheel mass moment of inertia times speed) times the angle through which
it can be moved. The relation between momentum and weight and power for wheels
and CMGs is presented in Table 10-20.

Estimating Angular Impulse for Spin Stabilization

For a spin-stabilized spacecraft, angular impulse is required for spinup, spin main-
tenance, and spin-axis precession. If the spacecraft is spin-stabilized for only part of
its mission (such as during kick-stage thrusting), then impulse is also needed for
despin.

The impulse requirement for spinup is:
L spinup =I, Q, (10-9)

where Lp inyp is the impulse required in N -m-s, 4, is the spacecraft moment of inertia
about the spin axis in kg-m2, and 2, is the spin speed in rad/s. Typical values of spin
speed range from 0.1 rad/s for spacecraft requiring minimal spin stability to 10 rad/s
for stabilization during kick motor firing. Impulse required for despin is computed
with this same equation. Note that the inertia of the spacecraft during despin may be
different than during spinup.

The principal merit of spin stabilization is that it is passive; that is, a spin-stabilized
spacecraft will remain spinning at constant rate with its spin axis substantially fixed in
inertial space. However, if the spacecraft has a thrusting mode such as kick-stage firing
or thruster firing for velocity correction, both the spin speed and the spin axis orienta-
tion may be changed. Disturbance torques as presented in Table 10-18 may also make
spin corrections necessary.

Variation in spin speed occurs when the thruster’s axis and spacecraft center of
mass are misaligned. If the offset between center of mass and the thrust axis is L,,,, the
angular impulse, AH, imparted by a velocity correction AV to a spacecraft of mass m,/,
is:

AH = my AV Lem (10-10)

If the offset is in the direction that changes the spin speed, then impulse will be
required to correct spin speed. If the offset is along the spin axis, the spacecraft
angular-momentum vector will precess, thus changing the orientation of the spin axis.
In either event, impulse is required to correct the unwanted change. If spin-speed
correction is required, the impulse is about the spin axis and if precession is involved,
it is normal to the spin axis. Typical thruster alignment tolerance is 0.1 deg. This
tolerance, coupled with center of mass uncertainty, leads to typical thrust-axis to
center-of-mass offset of 0.002s—0.01s where s is the distance from the thruster to the
center of mass.

328 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

To change the direction of spin-axis orientation, we must precess the angular-
momentum vector. This is usually done by synchronizing off-axis thruster pulses with
the spin period of the spacecraft. The small increments of angular impulse imparted by
properly synchronized firings add at 90 deg to the momentum vector to rotate the
vector direction. Some nutation is also introduced by the thruster firings but this
decays with time. The impulse required to precess a spinning spacecraft through an
angle of @ radians is

Lprecess = Iss Q, a (10-11)

where J,, is the mass moment of inertia about the spin axis, Q, is the spin speed (in
rad/s) and @ is the angle of rotation of the spin vector in radians.

The total angular impulse is converted to propellant weight through the use of
Eq. (10-10). Typical weight and power for attitude control components are summa-
rized in Table 10-20 and discussed in Sec. 11.1. Actuators and wheels are available in
a large number of sizes and capabilities. Their weight and power as a function of
torque may be estimated by the relations given.

10.4.3 Communications Subsystem

The communications subsystem receives and demodulates uplink signals and
modulates and transmits downlink signals. The subsystem also allows us to track
spacecraft by retransmitting received range tones or by providing coherence between
received and transmitted signals, so we can measure Doppler shift. Table 10-21 sum-
marizes the main system considerations which drive the design of communications
subsystems.

TABLE 10-21. System Considerations for Design of Communications Subsystems.
Consideration Implication
Access Ability to communicate with the spacecraft requires clear field of view
to the receiving antenna and appropriate antenna gain
Frequency Selection based on bands approved for spacecraft use by international
agreement. Standard bands are S (2 GHz), X (8 GHz), and Ku (12 GHz)

Baseband Data Data bandwidth and allowable error rate determine RF power level
Characteristics for communications

Communication access to a spacecraft requires a clear field of view for the
spacecraft antenna. It also requires sufficient received power to detect the signal with
acceptable error rate. Access across many viewing angles demands an antenna with a
wide beamwidth, so good spacecraft designs always include an antenna system that
can receive signals over at least a hemisphere. The gain of a widebeam antenna is
low—typically 0 dB for hemispheric coverage. Therefore, we must select a level of
transmit power and a receiver sensitivity that allow us to detect signals with an
acceptable error rate.

The spacecraft receives data consisting of commands and range tones. Command
rates range from 100 bits/s to 100 kbits/s, with most systems below 1,000 bits/s. The
data rate depends on mission considerations and sets the communications subsystem’ s
bandwidth, which establishes the received power required to detect signals (Chap. 13).

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 329

For spacecraft communicating directly with ground terminals, received signal strength
is not a design driver because we can set the ground terminal’s transmitting power as
high as necessary. However, received signal strength from a relay satellite does affect
the communications subsystem’s receiver sensitivity and maximum data rate. Systems
that require data communications at rates greater than 1,000 bits/s normally use high-
gain, directional antennas and can operate at low bit rates to allow wide-angle access
when needed.

The downlink signal consists of range tones, telemetry for spacecraft status, and
payload data. The baseband data is normally digital and multiplexed by frequency or
time. Telemetry to report the spacecraft’s status operates between 100 bits/s and
1,000 bits/s. If the downlink handles only status telemetry, or if the payload data will
fit within a low-bandwidth link, we can communicate using a widebeam antenna. Data
communication over a high bandwidth usually requires a high-gain, directional an-
tenna and a low-bandwidth mode for widebeam coverage.

Table 10-22 shows how we size the communications subsystem. To do so, we must
identify the data bandwidths of the uplink and downlink, select communication
frequencies, prepare RF power budgets for both links (Chap. 13), and select equip-
ment. The basic communications subsystem consists of a transmitter, a receiver, a
widebeam antenna, and an RF diplexer. We may also use a high-power transmitter or
a directional antenna if the data rate requires it.

10.4.4 Command and Data Handling Subsystem

The command and data handling subsystem, (C&DH), receives and distributes
commands and collects, formats, and delivers telemetry for standard spacecraft
operations (housekeeping) and payload operations. We usually handle housekeeping
data intermittently and at rates below 1,000 bits/s. Rates for payload commanding and
telemetry depend on the payload’s design. They may require very high data rates
(10 kb/s to 500 Mb/s) and storage of payload data.

The C&DH subsystem may include encryptors, decryptors, a sequencer or timer, a
computer for data processing, and equipment for data storage. It interfaces with the
communications subsystem from which it receives commands and to which it sends
the formatted telemetry stream. It also delivers commands to and receives telemetry
from the other spacecraft subsystems and may have similar interfaces with the
payload.

The decoding of command signals is peculiar to the detailed design of the system.
A typical command is a serial binary word containing a preamble, a user address, and
the command word. The preamble allows the spacecraft to identify and authenticate
the command. The command unit decodes the user addresses and then routes actual
commands to the correct users, either by separate wires or by a data bus. Each user then
decodes and executes the command.

In some cases, we need several commands to do something. If the function is time
critical, we can send precursor commands and verify their receipt before sending a
precisely timed execute or a time-tagged execute. A sequencer or onboard computer
can execute time-tagged commands. If we need to send commands over time, we can
time-tag them or use a timer-execute command followed by a sequence of timer-reset
commands. If the command system fails, the command halts when the timer times out.
Ordnance normally requires separate arm and fire commands.

Telemetry signals tell us about the spacecraft’s health and provide operational data
needed to control the spacecraft. Normally, we convert telemetry measurements to
digital signals, serially multiplex them in a telemetry frame using a repetitive pattern,
and transmit the frame using a main frame word for frame synchronization. We may
use a main frame word as a subcommutated channel or we may supercommutate
signals if we need a sampling rate higher than the frame rate. Finally, we may place
the telemetry frames in packets and multiplex them with other downlink data.

Commands and telemetry signals depend on the spacecraft’s operation. Each of the
spacecraft’s commandable functions needs a separate command. In addition, we must
provide enough telemetry to define the spacecraft’s state of health, as well as data for
operational control.

Table 10-24 lists the steps to size the C&DH subsystem. In its simplest form, this
subsystem consists of a command decoder and a telemetry multiplexer. More com-
plex systems distribute the command decoding function by routing serial commands
to user subsystems for final decoding. Telemetry multiplexing can also be distributed.
High-performance subsystems use central digital computers for data processing.
Table 10-25 presents typical characteristics. Chapter 11 describes more complex
subsystems.

10.4.5 Thermal Subsystem

The thermal design of a spacecraft involves identifying the sources of heat and
designing paths for transporting and rejecting heat, so components will stay within

required temperatures. The sources of heat include solar radiation, Earth-reflection
and infrared radiation, and electrical energy dissipated in the electrical components.
Conventional electronics operate at temperatures close to room temperature (25 °C)
and will tolerate temperature variations of about +20 °C. Battery cells, particularly
nickel-cadmium cells, are more sensitive to temperature than most electronics. But
they can still stand temperature ranges of 5 °C to 20 °C. We can control the tempera-
tures of compartments for conventional electronics by coating or insulating their outer
surfaces. We select these coatings to strike a balance between the heat absorbed and
the heat radiated to space. The coatings include various paints and tapes, and second
surface glass mirrors. The weight of such coatings is almost independent of the
quantity of heat dissipated and seldom exceeds 4% of the spacecraft dry weight. The
thermal coatings, particularly insulation, can close out compartment openings and may
also shield components from electromagnetic radiation.

Components which have stringent temperature requirements or which dissipate
large amounts of electrical power require more extensive thermal control. For exam-
ple, we usually place gyros and precision oscillators in insulated compartments, or
ovens, with active electrical heaters to control temperatures carefully. Traveling wave
tubes and other elements which dissipate a lot of power concentrate their dissipation
locally and produce hot spots. Normally, we conduct heat away from such hot spots

332 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

and spread it over a thermal panel where it radiates to space. If the hot spots are less
than 50 W, we can simply increase the thickness of the mounting panel so it will carry
the heat away. But more intense hot spots and equipment that must meet tight thermal
limits usually require heat pipes to move the heat and thus equalize temperatures.

The process of thermal design for spacecraft proceeds as follows. The first step is

to identify heat sources and the location of radiating panels to dispose of excess heat.
The heat sources include internal dissipation and external radiation from the Sun and
the Earth. Often, particular surfaces of the spacecraft are not exposed or only partially
exposed to the Sun or Earth. These faces are preferred locations for radiating panels
_and for components which dissipate large amounts of heat. The latter should be next
to the radiators. We can compute the total amount of radiating area from the static-
heat-balance equation for the entire spacecraft. But a component’s thermal perfor-
mance may differ markedly from the average.

Most power for thermal control goes to heaters that keep components from getting
too cold. Heaters also compensate for imperfections in insulation or heat leaks, and are
used to heat areas such as articulation joints that are difficult to insulate and dissipate
little heat internally. Heaters or heater-controlled heat pipes (see Sec. 11.5) offer very
tight control or control at a particular temperature value for certain components. A
typical medium-sized spacecraft (1,000 W) consumes 20 W in the thermal subsystem
plus any power required for special thermal control. In most cases, heaters can operate
from primary power.

10.4.6 Power Subsystem

The power subsystem generates power, conditions and regulates it, stores it for
periods of peak demand or eclipse operation, and distributes it throughout the space-
craft. The power subsystem may also need to convert and regulate voltage levels or
supply multiple voltage levels. It frequently switches equipment on or off and, for
increased reliability, protects against short circuits and isolates faults. Subsystem
design is also influenced by space radiation, which degrades the performance of solar
cells. Finally, battery life often limits the spacecraft’s lifetime.

Earlier in this chapter, I described how to prepare a power budget for the spacecraft.
This budget includes most of the information we need to size the power subsystem: the
spacecraft’s needs for operating power, storage requirements, and how the power
subsystem degrades over the spacecraft’s lifetime. The remaining steps to size the
power subsystem are selecting a solar-array approach, sizing the array, sizing the
batteries and the components that control charging, and sizing the equipment for
distributing and converting power.

Solar arrays are generally planar, cylindrical, or omnidirectional. Planar arrays are
flat panels pointed toward the Sun. Their power output is proportional to the projection
of their area toward the incident sunlight. Three-axis-stabilized spacecraft normally
use planar arrays. Cylindrical arrays appear on spin-stabilized systems in which the
spin axis is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the Sun line. The output of a solar-
cell array is nearly proportional to the amount of solar energy intercepted, and the
projected area of a cylinder is 1/n times the total area. Thus, the cylindrical array
should have approximately 7m times as many cells as a planar array with the same
power rating. But temperature effects slightly favor the cylindrical array, so the actual
ratio is closer to 1/2.5. If the spacecraft can receive sunlight from any aspect, then its
array must have equal projected area in all directions. In other words, it must have an
omnidirectional array. A sphere has this property, but paddles or cylinders combined

10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 333

with planar panels are also possible. The total area of an omnidirectional array must
be approximately 4 times the projected area, so an omnidirectional array has about
4 times the area of a planar array with the same power rating.

The required area of a planar solar array is related to the required power, P, the solar
constant (1,367 W/m2), and the conversion efficiency of the solar-cell system.
Although cells have had efficiencies as high as 30%, practical array designs range
from 5% to 15% when taking into account the operating conditions and degradation at
end-of-life. An array with an efficiency of 7% would have a required area of

0.07 x 1367

where A, is in m2 and P is in watts. This area is characteristic of current arrays. The
mass of a planar array with specific performance of 25 W/kg is

M,, = 0.04 P (10-13)

= 0.01P (10-12)

where M, is in kg and P in watts. Current designs range from 14 to 47 W/kg at
end-of- life. The high end would provide 66 W/kg at beginning-of-life. Solar arrays
mounted on the spacecraft’s body usually weigh less than planar arrays.

Rechargeable nickel-cadmium or nickel-hydrogen batteries are the usual devices
for energy storage for unmanned spacecraft. They are available in various sizes and
are highly reliable even though their performance characteristics are quite complex.
The battery often represents one of the most massive components in the spacecraft. It
also is very sensitive to temperature and to the use profile. Nickel-cadmium, and to a
lesser extent nickel-hydrogen batteries perform best when operated between 5 °C and
20 °C. This range is both lower and more restricted than the temperature requirements
for most electronic components. The battery also has complex wear-out mechanisms,
thus limiting cycle life as a function of depth-of-discharge. Other variables—temper-
ature, rate of charge, rate of discharge, and degree of overcharge-—-also affect cycle life
but in a less well-defined way. If a battery has shallow discharge cycles, it loses capac-
ity. To counter this tendency, most spacecraft recondition their batteries from time to
time by discharging them completely.

We determine a battery’s capacity from the energy it must produce (discharge
power times discharge duration) and from its depth-of-discharge. We select the
battery’s depth-of-discharge to meet cycle life requirements. Table 10-26 gives guide-
lines on depths-of-discharge for nickel-cadmium and nickel-hydrogen batteries.
Section 11.4 discusses these concepts in more detail.

TABLE 10-26. Allowed Battery Depth-of-Discharge vs. Cycle Life.

Cycle Life Battery Type Depth of Discharge
Less than 1,000 cycles NiCd 80%
NiH> 100%
10,000 cycles NiCd 30%
NiH 50%

To compute a battery’s capacity, we divide the discharge energy (watt-hours) by
the depth-of-discharge. The ratio of battery weight to battery capacity is 30 to
40 W-hr/kg for NiCd batteries and 35 to 50 W: hr/kg for NiHy.Often, several batteries


334 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4

operate in parallel to provide the needed capacity. By using several small batteries, we
can add some redundant batteries for backup with less weight penalty than for a second
large battery.

Spacecraft primary power—power produced by the solar array and batteries—is
not well regulated (28 + 5 V is typical). Furthermore, we must match the solar array’s
electrical output to the battery’s charging requirements and provide switching equip-
ment that allows the battery to supply power when needed. Section 11.4 describes
various ways to meet these needs. Significant features include limiting the battery’s
charge rate, limiting overcharge, providing for low-impedance discharge, and provid-
ing for reconditioning. The controller or regulator must cope with the voltage swings
between charge and discharge. The power control unit must isolate faults and switch
to redundant units while also serving as the center of the power distribution network.
An estimate of the power control unit’s weight is 0.02 kg/W of controlled power.

Most electronic equipment, for both the payload and the spacecraft, requires
voltage regulation tighter than that provided by the arrays and batteries. We must
either regulate the primary power or convert it to secondary power, which we can reg-
ulate more tightly. In either case, power dissipates in the regulator or the power
converters. This dissipation typically amounts to 20% of the power converted, which
may be all of the spacecraft’s operating power. In sizing the power subsystem, we
must therefore include the weight of the power conversion equipment—typically
0.025 kg/W converted.

The power subsystem includes wiring for distribution and may have components
for switching and fault isolation. The power dissipated in wiring losses and switching
equipment is 2% to 5% of the operating power, and the wiring harness takes up 1% to
4% of the spacecraft dry weight. Spacecraft which must operate in high radiation
environments may require shielded wire to distribute power. Table 10-27 summarizes
the weight and power requirements of the power subsystem.

Primary power is distributed in most unmanned spacecraft as low-voltage direct
current. But for systems with power needs above 10 kW, we should consider alternat-
ing current distribution, both sine wave and square wave, at several hundred volts.

Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) have been designed for various
power levels but have been applied only to low-power needs. In practice, the units
consist of a radioisotope heat source which can produce power by thermoelectrics or
provide thermal energy to a rotating generator. If we use one of these units, we must
dispose of excess heat during all mission phases and particularly during launch

preparation and boost. We must also consider safety issues, but RTG sources are
probably safer than most propellants. The design must ensure that the generator
remains intact and shielded even during catastrophic launch failure.

Using rotating machines to generate primary power is another design with
potential. Closed-cycle, thermal engines should be nearly twice as efficient as solar
cells, and rotating generators can provide sine-wave AC power with better regulation
than solar-cell designs.

10.4.7 Structures and Mechanisms

The spacecraft structure carries and protects the spacecraft and payload equipment
through the launch environment and deploys the spacecraft after orbit injection. The
load-carrying structure of a spacecraft is primary structure, whereas brackets, closeout
panels, and most deployable components are secondary structure.

We size primary structure based on the launch loads, with strength and stiffness
dominating its design. The size of secondary structure depends on on-orbit factors
rather than boost-phase loads. Secondary structure only has to survive but not function
during boost, and we can usually cage and protect deployables throughout this phase.

Each of the launch boosters provides maximum acceleration levels to be used for
design (see Chap. 18). These acceleration levels or load factors are typically 6 g’s
maximum axial acceleration and 3 g’s maximum lateral acceleration. These levels
work for conceptual design, but some designers prefer to increase them by as much as
50% during early design phases. During preliminary sizing, we must remember that
the primary structure must carry some weight, such as kick motors and propellant,
which will drop away before orbit injection. Section 11.6 discusses structural design
and presents methods for preliminary structural sizing.

We use cylindrical and conical shell structures and trusses for primary structure,
commonly building them out of aluminum and magnesium with titanium for end
fittings and high-strength attachments. Composite materials have seen limited use in
primary structure to date but they will become more common. We can size primary
structure by modeling it as a cylindrical beam which is mass loaded by its own weight
and the spacecraft’s components. The lateral load factors applied to this beam produce
a moment that is a function of axial location. Compression in the extreme section of
the beam carries the moment. By adding the axial load to the moment-induced,
compressive load, we can estimate the critical load, which in turn sizes the primary
structure (see Eq. 11-42). In these preliminary sizing calculations, we can exercise
much license in assuming symmetry and in simplifying the loads. We can iterate the
skin gage to withstand stress levels and check the tubular design for buckling (see
Sec. 11.6.6).

We use a similar approach to size a truss-based primary structure. We reduce the
truss to its simplest form by successively removing redundant members until we reach
a statically determinant structure. Simply combining loading conditions allows us to
size the truss members.

We must also locate and mount components on the basic, load-carrying cylinder or
truss. Most electronic components have rectangular symmetry and are mounted with
lugs or bosses integral to their housings. Mounting requirements include loads, good
thermal contact with the mounting surface, and good electrical contact. Aluminum
honeycomb is an excellent mount for components. It attaches to longeron-stringer
frames to form a semi-monocoque (load-carrying skin) structure. Honeycomb sheets
with composite faces occasionally substitute for other approaches.

336 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.5

Some components are not rectangular. For example, propellant tanks are normally
spherical but may be elongated, have conical sections, or be toroidal. Electromechan-
ical drives and reaction wheels are cylindrical, and control moment gyros are complex.
These components include mounting provisions in their designs. Generally they have
flanges, bosses, or lugs. In most cases, and particularly in the case of tanks and pres-
sure vessels, the mounting must avoid loading the component. To do so, the mount
must be statically determinant, and component loads from deflection of the mount
must be minimal.

Other components of complex geometric shape, such as thrusters and connectors,
may mount through brackets specifically tailored to them. Hinges and similar items are
machined fittings with integral flanges or mounting bosses. We can align components
by shimming, but we must be careful not to disturb thermal and electrical bonds.

A set of data on spacecraft subsystem mass is presented in Appendix A. These data
show the structural mass to be approximately 20% of the spacecraft total. However
these data do not include all of the injected mass (apogee kick motors carried in the
spacecraft are not included). Therefore one should be careful about using these data
for estimating new designs. However, structural mass of 10% to 20% of spacecraft dry
mass is a reasonable starting point.

We must have an interstage structure to mount the spacecraft to the booster. This
structure conforms to the booster provisions for mounting and carries loads during the
boost phase. Both truss structures and conical adapters are common. Because this
structure is designed for strength under high loads, it is an excellent candidate for
high-strength materials and weight-efficient design. The spacecraft usually provides
this interstage structure and incorporates a separation joint to release the spacecraft at
orbit.

Common methods of attachment at the separation plane are marmon clamps or
separation bolts. In the marmon clamp, the separation joint is a continuous ring held
together by an annular clamp. Release of clamp tension allows the joint to separate. In
the case of separation bolts, the joint is held by several bolts which are released by
either severing the bolt or by releasing a nut. Once the separation joint is free, springs
impart a small velocity increment to the spacecraft. After separation, the booster
maneuvers to avoid accidental impact. For spin-stabilized spacecraft, the interstage
structure may incorporate a mechanism to impart spin while ejecting the spacecraft.

The Shuttle interfaces differently from the expendable boosters. It links with its
payloads at a series of hard points located along the sill of the cargo bay and along the
cargo bay’s centerline (keel fittings). The payload and its upper stages usually require
acradle or fittings to translate the loads into these hard points. Mechanisms for deploy-
ing the spacecraft may be spring-powered or motor-driven. Chapter 11 presents
weight-estimating relations for motor-driven mechanisms. Spring-powered mecha-
nisms must meet stiffness requirements, but they weigh about half as much as their
motor-driven equivalents.

10.5 Integrating the Spacecraft Design

10.5.1 Spacecraft Size

If we know the spacecraft’s weight and power, we can estimate its size. Most space-
craft have a main body or equipment compartment. Many also have solar panels which
wrap around the compartment for launch and deploy outside the compartment on orbit.

10.5 Integrating the Spacecraft Design 337

Table 10-28 gives estimating relations based on analysis of the volume and dimen-
sions of a number of spacecraft. These spacecraft ranged from 135 kg to 3,625 kg and
represent about 15% of the U.S. spacecraft launched between 1978 and 1984 [TRW
Defense and Space Systems Group, 1980-1985]. Their density ranged from 20 kg/m3
to 172 kg/m3, with an average of 79 kg/m3. The spacecraft were all cylindrically
symmetric, although the cross section varied from rectangular to circular. The ratio of
base diameter to cube root of mass ranged from 0.16 m/kg!3 to 0.31 m/kg!3, with an
average of 0.23 m/kg!/3. The ratio of spacecraft height to cube root of mass ranged
from 0.13 to 0.83, with an average of 0.39 m/kg!/3.

Section 10.4.6 presented relations for estimating the area of a solar array. Some-
times, the required array area is smaller than the spacecraft’s body area, and the body
can be oriented properly relative to the Sun. In this case, we can mount the solar cells
directly on the body. But high-power spacecraft usually mount the solar cells on
external panels, either off to one side or symmetrically on both sides of the equipment
compartment. External solar arrays greatly increase the spacecraft’s moment of
inertia, particularly about the axes perpendicular to the array axis. Suppose the solar
array consists of two square panels, one on each side of the spacecraft, and the center
of each of these panels is L, meters from the body’s center. If so, the increase in
moment of inertia is approximately L,2M,, where M, is the solar array weight.
Table 10-29 gives an approximate expression for L, in terms of the array area and the
body dimension, s. It shows the solar array’s moment of inertia relative to the space-
craft’s center. External solar arrays also affect the total projected spacecraft area,
which in turn influences aerodynamic drag and solar-radiation pressure. Table 10-29
summarizes estimating rules for solar-array moment of inertia and area offset. A, is the
total solar array area. We must add these inertias to the inertias of the central compart-
ment, assuming the latter to be equal to the values for the folded spacecraft computed
above.

10.5.2 Lifetime and Reliability

Reliability is a parameter under the designer’s control. We should consider its
potential effect on spacecraft sizing during conceptual design by examining failures
from wear-out and random causes. In other words, we should identify the ways in
which the spacecraft may fail and tailor the design to eliminate or limit failures to
acceptable levels. This implies identifying components or functions which can wear
out and designing the system so that they meet the mission’s lifetime requirements.
Propellant supply and battery-cycle life are examples of these components. If equip-
ment does not wear out, we must evaluate how each part’s failure affects the mission
and modify the design to eliminate any single-point failures. Then, we use statistics to
compute the probability of mission success and tailor the design to acceptable levels.
This process is not exact, but careful attention to reliability gives us the most balanced
and able system possible.

To design for reliability, we must understand what constitutes success. The more
specifically and numerically we can state the success criteria, the easier we can trans-
late these criteria into design requirements. After defining success, we should list the
smallest amount of equipment or number of functions that will provide it. We can
begin by placing these functions in a signal flow or block diagram. In this basic form,
most functions involve only one path or set of equipment. For this reason, we some-
times call it a single-string reliability model. Later in the design process, we can add
multiple paths or backup modes to improve the probability of success, taking care to
understand both the reliability enhancement and the cost.

By understanding the functions needed for a successful mission, we understand the
factors which limit mission life or threaten that success. Often a new mission depends
on developing or exploiting new technology, so we need to know the technology and
the factors that stress the components of our system. By reducing our knowledge to a
set of specifications and applying the stresses to our design, we improve our ability to
produce reliable hardware.

One of the key steps in design for reliability is to numerically predict the probability
of success. To do so, we must differentiate failures from wear-out and failures from
random causes. Classic reliability models depict the rate of failure when plotted
against time as a “bathtub”-shaped curve. Early on, systems fail at high rates because
of infant mortality, late in life, they fail because of wear-out. We can eliminate failures
from infant mortality with careful construction, testing, and burn-in. We can avoid
wear-out by understanding and eliminating the factors that cause it or by providing
enough hardware to replace worn-out equipment. Between the extremes of infant
mortality and wear-out, the failure rate is more or less uniform and attributed to
random effects.

Wear-out shortens a mission. Random failures kill a spacecraft with accumulated
effects. A successful design copes with them by providing enough backup components
to cover them. Because we cannot determine when they will occur, our design must
allow us to detect and correct them. Also, a good design tolerates some failures and
remains useful in a degraded mode.

Searching for and identifying the ways in which equipment can fail is a basic part
of design for reliability. This process, called Failure Modes Effects and Criticality
Analysis (FMECA) assumes that we can identify the ways in which equipment can fail
and analyze the effect. Key to this process is identifying and eliminating single-point
failure modes—failures that by themselves can kill the mission. If we cannot eliminate
them, we must control their probability of occurrence.

10.6 Examples 339

We can analyze the failure modes of our equipment in several ways. For example,
the all-part method simply analyzes each of the spacecraft’s parts to determine the
effect of its failure. On a large spacecraft this method is a lot of work but is straight-
forward and easy to do. The all-part method requires us to analyze shorts and opens
—systematically searching for wires or printed traces on circuit boards that can cause
failure if opened or shorted together. We can also use scenarios to find potential failure
modes. To do so, we simulate the spacecraft’s launch, deployment, and operation to
ensure that telemetry can detect failures and that the command system can correct
them. This simulation normally occurs when operational procedures are being pre-
pared, but it can more effectively detect design flaws if done earlier.

Another way to identify failure modes is the jury method. In many cases new
designs do not have a lot of experience behind them, but people have had experience
with similar equipment. We can poll them as part of a formal design review or in a
separate meeting, thus using their experience to identify likely failure modes and
probable effects.

10.6 Examples

In this section, we discuss three examples of spacecraft sizing. First we develop a
preliminary estimate of the FireSat spacecraft and then review two actual systems
—FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B.

The drivers for the FireSat spacecraft design are the FireSat payload design
(Sec. 9-7, Table 9-15) and the orbit and AV requirements (Table 7-3). We will use
these to get a broad estimate of the overall size, weight, and power for FireSat and then
to break this down into approximate subsystem allocations. The results of the top-level
process are summarized in Table 10-30. Keep in mind that these are crude estimates
that allow us to begin the process of spacecraft design. We must continually evaluate
and refine the requirements and resulting design and perform a variety of system trades
to arrive at an acceptable, consistent design.

Our first estimate of the spacecraft mass and power come directly from the payload
estimates of Sec. 9-7 (Table 9-15). As given in Table 10-5, the payload mass is
between 17% and 50% of the spacecraft dry weight with an average of 30% (see also
Appendix A). We know very little about FireSat at this time, so we will add margin by
estimating the payload at 20% of the spacecraft mass, well below the average percent-
age. However, FireSat was scaled down from a flight unit. This implies that the bus
will probably be a larger fraction of the spacecraft dry weight. Our knowledge of the
weight is poor at this time because we have not yet done a preliminary weight budget.
When we allocate the mass to subsystems below we will hold the margin at the system
level to allow us to apply it as needed to various subsystems.

Similarly, our initial power estimate is based on the payload power of 32 W and the
estimate from Table 10-9 that for moderate size spacecraft, the payload represents
40% of the spacecraft power. Our spacecraft is small with significant control and
processing requirements. Therefore, we will again be conservative and assume that the
payload represents only 30% of the power requirement for FireSat. Here the knowl-
edge is very poor, because we have not yet budgeted the power and have not
determined what payload duty cycle should be used—that is, should we turn the pay-
load off over the poles and oceans? Because we will have to contend with eclipses
(Sec. 5.1, Example 1), the solar array output will be estimated at 170 W to provide
110 W to the spacecraft which then provides 32 W to the payload.

In Sec. 7.5.1, we decided to try eliminating a kick stage and flying the spacecraft
up using low-thrust chemical propulsion. In order to maintain reasonable efficiency,
we initially assume a metered bipropellant system with an I,, of 300 s (Sec. 10.4.1,
Chap. 17). Using the rocket equation (Eq. 17-7), we can compute the propellant mass
as 28 kg and then add small amounts for attitude control and margin as given in
Table 10-30. Here our knowledge of the propellant mass as a fraction of the spacecraft
mass is good, although the spacecraft mass itself is not yet well known. Because the
propellant mass is small, we may choose later to go to a simpler monopropellant
system or to have the launch vehicle put FireSat directly into its end orbit.

Given an approximate mass for the whole system we can estimate the size and
moments of inertia from Table 10-28. This, in turn, can tell us something about the
solar array configuration. We estimate the body area at 2.0 m2 and the required solar
array area at 1.7 m2. So we can probably avoid solar panels altogether and use an
omnidirectional array consisting of solar cells mounted on the non-nadir facing sides
of the body. This will be compact, economical, and easy to control.

Finally, Table 10-31 presents two ways of developing a preliminary weight budget
for FireSat. We can estimate the mass of each subsystem as a percentage of spacecraft

10.6 Examples 341

dry mass or as a percentage of the payload mass. Column (1) lists the average percent-
age of spacecraft dry mass devoted to each subsystem based on the historical data for
spacecraft listed in Appendix A. The resulting mass distribution and margin are shown
in column (3). Column (2) lists the same data expressed as the average percentage of
payload mass devoted to each subsystem. The resulting FireSat mass distribution is
shown in column (4). We recommend using the mass distribution shown in column
(4). A weight margin of at least 25% at this stage of development is appropriate. The
column (3) approach resulted in a “margin” of only 11.2 kg or 8% of the spacecraft
dry mass. This approach prematurely divides the available margin among the
subsystems. We recommend maintaining the margin at the system level and then allo-
cating it to the payload or other subsystems as necessary throughout the development.

To provide more detailed examples of spacecraft design, we'll look at two actual
spacecraft—FLTSATCOM [Reeves, 1979] and HEAO-B [Frazier, 1981] and use our
estimating techniques to describe them. Figure 10-3 shows the basic configuration of
these spacecraft and their principal mission parameters.

providing UHF communications between ground stations and mobile users. The
communications payload equipment consists of receivers, processors, transmitters,
and antennas. Its mission of global communications requires full-Earth antenna
coverage. The antennas are body-fixed and oriented to point toward nadir. The orbit
has a 24-hour period (geosynchronous) and initially is inclined 2.5 deg to the equator.
There is no active inclination control. The launch vehicle is an Atlas-Centaur to inject
the spacecraft into an elliptic transfer orbit. At apogee, a solid kick motor injects the
spacecraft into geosynchronous orbit. The spacecraft uses the Air Force Satellite
Control Network for command and control.

The mission of HEAO-B was X-ray astronomy. Its payload consisted of 5 X-ray
instruments mounted within a telescope assembly. The mission required the telescope

to be pointed anywhere and stabilized to 1 arcmin accuracy, with 30 arcsec stability
over one hour. A slew rate of 10 deg/min was required. The orbit was circular at
540 km altitude inclined at 22.75 deg. HEAO-B was launched on an Atlas-Centaur in
late 1978 and had a design life of one year. It interfaced with NASA’s GSTDN S-band
ground network.

Table 10-33 presents the key design decisions for configuring the two spacecraft.
Weight dominated the FLTSATCOM design. The payload was large and complex,
and mission-reliability goals required complete payload redundancy. The Atlas-
Centaur’s launch capability limited the weight, thus requiring tight weight control.
Because the FLTSATCOM payload required over 1,000 W, designers selected an
oriented planar solar array. The Atlas-Centaur’s fairing diameter also limited the
spacecraft’s folded size. The spacecraft employs two attitude-control modes: spin
stabilization for orbit injection and 3-axis stabilization for on-orbit control. All
communication components are body-fixed, and the body is controlled to point the
antennas toward nadir. A planar solar array is articulated about one axis to point
toward the Sun. Liquid-hydrazine propulsion provides attitude and orbit control; a
solid apogee kick motor injected the spacecraft into orbit.

Weight did not dominate the design for HEAO-B. Its payload instruments existed
before the program developed the spacecraft to carry them. The program was able to
establish large weight and power margins. The fairing diameter affected the space-
craft’s size, but the instruments fit within this diameter. Power requirements were
modest and a planar body-fixed array was used. The spacecraft mission required
precision pointing of the payload, which led to 3-axis attitude control using
gyroscopes, star sensors, and reaction wheels. Kick-stage propulsion was not required.
Hydrazine monopropellant propulsion was used for attitude control.

Design Budgets

Table 10-34 presents the propellant budget, velocity increments, specific impulse,
and spacecraft mass for FLTSATCOM. To derive the velocity required to insert the
spacecraft into its final orbit, the designers used the methods in Chap. 7. That chapter
also describes injection-error analysis which the designers used to derive the velocity
increment that corrected the orbit. The ratio of this error to the AKM velocity (0.5%)
is typical of current performance for solid motors. The stationkeeping velocity derives
from analysis of orbit perturbations over the spacecraft’s design life. The stationkeep-
ing increment developed from an operational requirement to move the spacecraft at a
rate of 15 deg longitude per day. During orbit injection FLTSATCOM spin-stabilized
at 60 rpm and maneuvered through an angle of 65 deg while spinning. Eqs. (10-7) and
(10-9) translate these requirements into propellant weight. During its lifetime the
spacecraft uses propellant for attitude control, mainly to counter solar radiation
pressure. HEAO-B needed propellant only to acquire attitude and to cancel distur-
bance torques (principally aerodynamics and gravity gradient; see Table 10-18). The
propellant’s mass was 138 kg.

Tables 10-35 and 10-36 present the power and weight budgets for FLTSATCOM
and HEAO-B. HEAO-B had two normal power modes: cruise and ground pass. The
table shows power requirements for both modes, together with the orbital average. The
batteries were sized for 20% depth of discharge because the mission life exceeded
5,000 discharge cycles. For FLTSATCOM, payload power, including noted power
conversion losses, is the main entry. The FLTSATCOM battery was large enough to

10.6 Examples 345

support the full operating power during the maximum eclipse of 1.2 hours. The bat-
teries operated at a maximum depth of discharge of 70% and required a recharge
power of 167 W. Designers sized the array for a beginning-of-life power of 1,800 W.

Subsystem Design

Table 10-37 shows characteristics of the propulsion subsystems for the example
spacecraft. Each subsystem uses liquid-hydrazine propellant stored in two tanks. The
tanks are pressurized with a fixed amount of nitrogen gas, so the hydrazine pressure
decays as propellant burns. The tanks can cross connect through commandable isola-
tion valves. Thrusters and propellant plumbing are redundant and able to cross
connect. HEAO-B used twelve 4.4-N thrusters mounted in six dual-thruster assem-
blies. FLTSATCOM uses sixteen 4.4-N thrusters and four 0.44-N thrusters mounted
in dual-thruster assemblies.

Table 10-38 summarizes the attitude-control requirements for the two example
spacecraft (see Table 10-13). FLTSATCOM employs body-mounted antennas for its
payload and orients one body face to point the antennas toward nadir. FLTSATCOM
also has a planar solar array which it orients toward the Sun by combining body
orientation and rotation of the array axis. Finally, FLTSATCOM has a guidance
requirement for AV corrections. HEAO-B was required to point anywhere except close
to the Sun and hold accurate pointing for long periods. It also had modest power
requirements and no requirement for orbit correction.

Both FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B are 3-axis-controlled spacecraft. Both space-
craft had body-mounted payloads and controlled the body’s attitude to point the
payloads (see Table 10-13). Both spacecraft use one axis of body attitude control to
orient a planar solar array toward the Sun. FLTSATCOM, which requires more than
1 kW of electric power, orients the array about a second axis.

FLTSATCOM employs a solid apogee kick motor to inject it into orbit. Attitude is
controlled during AKM firing by spin stabilization (see Tables 10-14 and 10-15). The
spin direction can be rotated by using an off-axis thruster; the thruster fires pulses syn-
chronized with the spin period. During normal operation and AV firing, FLTSATCOM
is 3-axis stabilized. It uses Earth and Sun sensors for attitude sensing and thrusters and
a reaction wheel for torque. HEAO-B did not have a AV mode. Under normal
operation, it used gyroscopes and Sun sensors for attitude sensing with wheels and
thrusters for torque. Its torqued gyroscopes slewed the reference-pointing direction,
and payload star sensors allowed accurate reference and correction of gyro drift.
Radiation pressure causes the main disturbance torques for FLTSATCOM. Gravity
gradient and aerodynamics were the chief torques for HEAO-B. See Table 10-18 and
Sec. 11.1.

Table 10-39 shows weight and power values for components of the complete
guidance, navigation, and control subsystems (including redundancy) for both
FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B.

FLTSATCOM employed a single system for tracking, telemetry, and command
(TT&C). This spacecraft uses only 977 commands for infrequent commanding. The
telemetry requirements are 178 mainframe words (0.5 s frame rate) and fewer than
1,000 subcommutated words—typical of a minimum subsystem for TT&C. A wide-
beam antenna mounted on the tip of the main payload’s antenna mast ensures
communications access to the satellite.

The communications requirements for HEAO-B were driven by HEAO’s low-
altitude and low-inclination orbit, which allowed infrequent access to the spacecraft
for commanding and data readout. Table 10-40 summarizes characteristics of the
communications subsystem and the subsystem for command and data handling.
HEAO-B’s spacecraft had to maneuver and take payload data while out of sight of a
ground station. The commanding subsystem included a stored command programmer
which could store and execute 256 commands. Data remained on a tape recorder until
the ground station read it out at communication intervals.

The FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B components require temperatures of 5-50 °C
—wno challenge to the designers. Thermal balance is achieved by mounting the com-
ponents on external panels of the equipment compartment and allowing the panels to
radiate excess heat to space. Second-surface mirrors serve as radiators, taking
advantage of their low solar absorptivity and high infrared emissivity. Areas not
required for radiation are insulated. The spacecraft’s interior surfaces are black to
enhance internal heat transfer, and guard heaters prevent excessively low temperatures
when equipment is off, or on sensitive assemblies such as propellant lines.

Table 10-35 presented power budgets for FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B. Table
10-41 shows the characteristics and components of their power subsystems. FLTSAT-
COM uses planar arrays oriented toward the Sun by solar-array drives and controls the
body’s attitude about the Z-axis (yaw control). The array produces 1,800 W at begin-
ning of life. HEAO-B used planar solar panels which were body-mounted. They were
oriented toward the Sun by X-axis (roll) attitude control which kept the Sun in the X-Z
body plane. With this attitude, the Sun was up to 75 deg away from the array normal.
To improve this poor illumination, designers sized the array for 1,500 W under full
solar illumination.

Both FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B use NiCd batteries. The cycle life for FLTSAT-
COM was less than 1,000 cycles, and the three batteries operated at 70% depth of
discharge. They also contain bypass electronics to allow removal of failed cells. The
three HEAO-B batteries had a cycle life of over 5,000 cycles and operated at 20%
depth of discharge.

Table 10-41 also shows the characteristics of the power control, switching, cabling,
and conversion equipment on FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B. The FLTSATCOM
spacecraft uses an unregulated bus and switches power to user subsystems in central
power-control units. A central power converter provides secondary power for the
spacecraft bus subsystems. HEAO-B used a regulated solar array and also switched
power to users in a set of integration assemblies. These units also contained power
converters.

Table 10-42 summarizes the structural design of FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B.

Figure 10-4 shows the structure of FLTSATCOM, and Fig. 10-5 shows the structure
of HEAO-B. The HEAO-B structure was a semi-monocoque in which longerons, stiff-
ened skin panels, and rings carried the loads. Both spacecraft were launched on the
Atlas-Centaur and were designed to substantially the same boost loads. In the launch
configuration, both spacecraft were about the same diameter, although HEAO-B was
slightly longer. The on-orbit configurations of the spacecraft were quite different
because FLTSATCOM has a large, deployable, solar array and deployed antennas.
HEAO-B had essentially the same configuration on orbit as during launch. The two
spacecraft had different designs for the load-carrying structure. FLTSATCOM carries
loads with a central cylinder. The equipment compartment mounts around this cylin-
der, and the deployables stay around the outside of the compartment during boost.

Design Integration

Table 10-43 gives relations for estimating the spacecraft’s size based on its weight.
Equations (10-12) and (10-13) give relations for estimating solar-array area and
weight based on the spacecraft’s total power. The table compares the actual parameters
for FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B to the estimated values.
