23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases
23.2 Lessons Learned from Existing Space Programs
23.3 Future Trends

Since the first edition of Space Mission Analysis and Design (SMAD) appeared in
1989, substantial progress has been made in applying this process more broadly to
space missions, in part because of the continuing pressure to reduce mission costs.
With the exception of launch, costs in all segments of space missions have been
reduced. Launch costs, while not having succumbed as yet, are under attack from a
wide variety of directions. A large number of communications constellations are being
created that are bringing a more manufacturing-oriented methodology to bear, with an
emphasis on both lower cost and high quality. Even interplanetary missions are
becoming quicker and less expensive. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize how
best to make the SMAD process work within the real environment of acquisition
regulations, programs long past preliminary study phases, and the “new space” mis-
sions which we hope will be forthcoming in future years.

Much of this book ignores two of the major challenges to doing SMAD: organiza-
tional structure and the acquisition process. Both tend to introduce political and
bureaucratic obstacles to our goal of developing cost-effective designs. As described
briefly in Sec. 21.1, any space program exists within a broad and important context of
law, policy, politics, and economics which we must not ignore. We are, after all, pro-
posing to spend large amounts of someone’s money designing and developing space
missions. Even the best program has little chance of success if it does not fit into the
political, economic, and policy context that must support it. Politics can include, for
example, the need to have manufacturing distributed around the country for publicly
funded programs or use of technology from specific companies for privately funded
ones. In any case, we need to work within these boundaries.

Our goal is to learn from past space programs and apply that experience, along with
our judgment of how to do it better, to new and ongoing programs. In practice, we
often end up doing things the way we have always done them, perhaps because it’s
worked or is simply easier to do than trying to change the mindset of individuals and
organizations. Introducing change is difficult in any venue, but we must change and,
indeed, may need to take more calculated risks if we are to drive down the cost of space
missions.

884 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.1

This book develops space mission analysis and design through a series of process
tables indexed on the inside front cover. This process flow divides into three main
areas: high-level processes, definition of the elements, and detailed design. The high-
level processes develop concepts for the mission design. With these concepts in hand,
we can begin defining the characteristic elements of the space mission architecture.
Then we can design those elements in more detail. Table 1-1 in Sec. 1.1 gives you
simplified steps to begin designing your particular mission. Remember that success
depends on iterating and continuously improving the design.

We must caution you that SMAD does not work well whenever you need much
more than typical estimation accuracy. Our high-level algorithms and sanity checks
provide estimates for conceptual design. These estimates are enough in most cases, but
whenever performance is critical, or if you are approaching a technology threshold,
you should refer to more detailed information. Areas frequently needing more than
typical estimation accuracy are satellite lifetimes in low-Earth orbit, computer systems
sizing, and system cost modeling. Table 23-1 outlines ways to deal with these and
similar problems.

TABLE 23-1. Dealing with Areas Needing Much More Than Typical Estimation Accuracy.

1. Estimate as realistically as possible by working through succeeding levels of
the process tables outlined in these chapters.

2. Estimate both upper and lower bounds.
3. Use conservative values and substantial design margin.

4. If control of a parameter is critical:
A. Identify drivers during design.
B. Reestimate regularly as the design matures.
C. Develop and maintain options.

5. Be prepared to trade with overall system performance.

23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases

Nearly all space missions must respond appropriately to the economic and political
forces acting on them throughout their design and operational life. At all stages of a
program, we need to achieve two critical goals:

* Meet bonafide mission objectives and requirements while minimizing
program cost and risk

¢ “Sell” the program and keep it sold, if it remains worth doing

The evolving political and economic environment may alter program objectives or
make the program not worth doing. Even though a program continues to be worth-
while, it may still require a significant effort to demonstrate the mission utility within
the ever-changing environment.

Minimizing Program Cost and Risk

Early conceptual design has a great impact on both cost and risk. However, costs
fluctuate (usually upward) throughout a program. Increased cost is frequently justifi-
able, but can also be due to unnecessary engineering changes, schedule slips, and

23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases 885

changes in the funding profile. Thus, we would like to apply the SMAD process
throughout the mission life cycle to reduce, or at least contain, program cost and risk.
This process is summarized below and described in more detail in Wertz and Larson
[1996], Chap. 10.

Table 23-2 summarizes how to keep down cost and risk, but these steps can conflict
with how space programs are typically run. Good mission engineering demands that
we regularly review and consider revising mission objectives, requirements, and
approaches. However, this review may make the program seem unstable. We might
ask, “Why are we looking at our mission objectives and requirements again? We have
already done that and now must build the system.” We must do so because programs
and mission designs must mature and adapt to new conditions. Thus our concept of
operations, approach, and goals must also evolve.

TABLE 23-2. Mission Engineering Activities Needed Throughout the Mission Life. These
are key to containing or reducing cost.

Action Comment

. Maintain well-defined objective Ensure all engineering personnel know the broad
mission objectives

. Revisit system-level trades regularly Best done at beginning of each mission phase

3. Document reasons for choices Does not occur in standard formal documentation,
but is critical to maintaining options

. Maintain a strong systems engineering | Needed to continue developing lower-risk, lower-
group cost solutions and to keep program sold

. Control system-level trades and Allows trade between elements and applying
budgets within the systems margin to different elements as needed
engineering group

6. Update analysis of mission utility Necessary to keep program sold in a strongly
competitive, cost-conscious environment

A major part of doing our job better is to identify the right issues and look for key
alternatives to investigate. Working the wrong issues can be costly. For example, early
in the U.S. space program, scientists and engineers were trying to figure out how to
handle the enormous heat generated during reentry into the atmosphere. At first the
problem statement was, “Find a material that will withstand a temperature of
14,000 °F for 5 minutes.”” Much time and money were spent trying to solve this
problem even though no known material could withstand the required temperature.
Finally, someone recognized that the problem would be restated as, “Find a way to
protect a capsule and the person inside during reentry.”Ablative materials quickly
solved this problem. The moral of this story is to make certain you are working the
right problems and asking the right questions throughout the program.

Returning to see whether we are meeting basic mission objectives does not mean
we will change the concept of operations 2 months before launch. The further a pro-
gram has evolved, the more it takes to justify fundamental changes. Still, if a new tech-
nology or concept of operations can reduce mission cost, risk, and schedule, we should
evaluate and use it if it is worthwhile. As the program evolves, the cost of imple-
menting change becomes greater and the benefit decreases because other parts of the
mission have been designed to work as originally intended. Nonetheless, changes late
in the program may provide equal or better performance at less cost and risk.

886 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.1

Although reevaluating mission objectives may appear to jeopardize a program, the
result becomes stronger and sounder. We could keep the same mission concept
throughout, but a far better approach is to formally review mission requirements at the
beginning of each mission phase. This review tells us where the program is going and
why. At the same time, it allows us to resolve these issues by the end of each mission
phase to maintain program stability within a highly competitive environment.

Secondly, we must keep the program flexible by assigning economic value to
system flexibility. All too often, a program quickly becomes rigid by trying to
optimize the meeting of narrow requirements for the current mission design. Thus,
changing mission objectives or technology is difficult. Hewing to fixed requirements
may reduce cost for a small, short-turnaround, unique mission, but is unlikely to
succeed for larger-scale activities. For example, geosynchronous satellites should be,
and usually are, designed to work in multiple slots so we can move them from one
position to another. Expressed differently, the mission design as well as the design of
the elements should be robust, i.e., stable in the presence of unknown perturbations.
We need robust or flexible designs to help minimize the cost and risk of unforeseen
yet inevitable changes in mission objectives and requirements.

One way to make a system more flexible is to carry out as many onboard tasks as
possible in software and ensure we can reprogram the software from the ground. Now
that we have more sophisticated processors and greater onboard memory, we-can cre-
ate very flexible satellites without driving up cost and weight. This allows us to both
correct design flaws on orbit and respond to changing mission needs and conditions.

Too often, programs attempt to reduce risk by flying only components which have
flown before. Many subcontractors change their design only when manufacturers stop
making particular parts and components. A far better approach is be to allow some per-
formance margin and then use modern technology to achieve the needed performance
at lower weight, cost, and risk. As Chap. 20 outlines, we also make an informed
assessment of the Technology Readiness Level of a particular approach, assign it a
documented risk factor, and feed that information into the decision-making process.

An excellent approach to minimizing the risk of new technology has been used
successfully by Surrey Space Technology Laboratory, Ltd. on a sequence of missions.
As shown in Fig. 23-1, Surrey continually flies both an older, space-proven computer
and a newer, more powerful one. This approach allows Surrey to have both a conser-
vative flight-proven design to ensure mission success, while at the same time flying
some of the newest, most capable processors in space.

Keeping the Program Sold

History has shown that space programs can be cancelled in virtually any
phase—during conceptual design, during development and construction, after the first
one or two launches, or in mid-life while the spacecraft is still operating on orbit. The
message is clear: if the program is worth doing, we must keep the program sold
throughout its mission life. Doing so is straightforward.We must analyze mission
utility and trade cost against performance over the entire mission. We must also
maintain a clear, easy-to-understand and consistent rationale for mission objectives,
requirements and design decisions. At any time, we should be able to present a cost vs.
performance analysis and demonstrate to those who are funding it the benefits of
having the program proceed.

Maintaining an ongoing mission utility analysis capability means that we should
always be aware of the fundamental mission objectives and how well they are being

met. Thus, the mission objectives become important not only in the continuing design
of the program, but also in keeping it alive.

System Engineering Over the Life Cycle

_ Strong system and mission engineering should be maintained throughout the life of
the program: trading on requirements, reevaluating the basic mission concept, and
evaluating alternatives and mission utility. Otherwise the program may not continue.

Overall, mission engineering later in the program should proceed as outlined in
earlier chapters. At all levels, requirements should reflect what to do rather than how
to do it. We want to let technology flow up and into the program where it can do the
most good for cost, risk utility, or operations. We are unlikely to achieve the mission
performance at minimum cost and risk by limiting ourselves to the technologies and
approaches from the concept-design team.

A key element in mission engineering is to document the main system trades and,
especially, the reasons for choices. Unfortunately, specifications demand only that
you state what the system must do, how well it must be done, and how to verify that it
meets the requirement. They do not ask you to say why you have chosen the require-
ments. However, requirements are intended to quantify the trade between what we
would like to achieve and what is possible within the established budget. Thus, we
should document as fully as possible the reasons for these trades and requirements so
we can effectively revisit them during mission utility assessments and regular require-
ment reviews.

One way to initially reduce cost and schedule is to minimize the upfront engi-
neering on the program. “Shoot the engineers and get on with the program,” can get
programs moving and contain growing engineering costs. This approach has some
good features. We do not want to spend excessive time optimizing a strawman design
that will change drastically at a later date. We also do not want to develop too much
detail in the conceptual design. These activities divert resources from the more
important, top-level mission trades. At the same time, we must have enough upfront
system engineering as well as initial and continuing trades on objectives and mission

888 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.2

utility. There is no substitute for these activities—ignorance does not improve system
performance.

23.2 Lessons Learned from Existing Space Programs

For the most part, the existing space mission analysis and design process works
well: trade-offs among technical alternatives in essentially all areas bring positive
results. But in our experience there are four common pitfalls in the front-end planning
of space missions:

¢ Disregarding or failing to understand the needs of operators, users, and devel-
opers during the early phase of design

* Failing to trade on requirements
¢ Constraining trades to too low a level too early
¢ Postponing or avoiding assessment of alternatives

Inappropriate results such as higher cost or reduced performance usually result from
the acquisition process and organizational structure rather than from incorrect trade-
off decisions. Occasionally, parochial views and politics keep the players from
interacting in a way that fosters good upfront design and development of the space
mission. Designing the mission operations concept, generating requirements, and
performing early trades without taking into account the needs of the users, operators
and developers can doom a program to failure from the beginning. A key to success is
to foster continuous and open communications between the players. This can be an up-
hill battle involving multiple organizations and possibly multiple nations, but it must
be done.

The space mission concept and requirements drive any program, so users, operators
and developers of the system must work together to identify credible, cost-effective
mission approaches. Once requirements are defined, organizations often go to great
lengths and expense to meet them because they do not want to be unresponsive or to
say a given requirement is difficult. This can unnecessarily drive up cost. Table 23-3
shows steps that can help solve this problem.

TABLE 23-3. Steps to Help Alleviate the Problem of Failing to Trade on Requirements.

. Specify functional requirements only—not how they should be accomplished
. Identify and challenge difficult and costly requirements
. Begin concept exploration with system requirements trades

. Revisit top-level system requirement trades at each major milestone throughout the
program

. Maintain open communications among all groups involved

We often constrain trades to low levels too early. Early in a program we commonly
do trades like altitude vs. resolution and coverage but ignore trades between system
elements (see Fig. 1-3). We should look for cost-effective trade-offs among the
elements such as shifting capability from the launch vehicle to the spacecraft or from
the spacecraft to the ground segment. For example, we can move more computing and

23.3 Future Trends 889

data processing from the ground station to the spacecraft for autonomous navigation.
The question is, should we provide a spacecraft which can determine its position and
velocity on board and remove the interface to the ground? This could increase the cost
of spacecraft development but save a great deal in operations cost by reducing the
ground system’s need to track the spacecraft, process data, and provide spacecraft
ephemeris. This is a politically sensitive trade because it takes money and responsi-
bility away from the ground element and gives them to the space element. This can
result in a turf battle where decisions are made on the basis of who controls the budget,
rather than on what provides the best results at the lowest cost.
Two positive steps can help reduce these problems:

* Look explicitly for trades between system elements

¢ Do these trades as early as possible, before organizational structure and poli-
tics rule out major options

Look at the result of these trades carefully. For example, when someone presents an
extremely low-cost spacecraft concept with minimal capability, look for higher costs
in other mission elements.

We often postpone or avoid assessing major alternatives for space programs. We
do so to meet tight budget constraints, to keep the program appearing stable, and to
avoid reducing the momentum to proceed. As we know, change costs much more as a
program proceeds. Change during concept exploration may do little or nothing to
engineering cost, whereas changes during the definition phase involve more people
and a reassessment of a more detailed design. Design changes involve formal
paperwork and change controls. Changing anything once the hardware is in production
can dramatically increase cost. It is more cost-effective to make changes as early as
possible.

23.3 Future Trends

In several respects, we expect more changes in the way that space programs are
conducted over the coming decade than have occurred since the start of the space
program.” In the near term, three distinct trends are apparent:

* Increased political and economic constraints driving the industry toward
lower-cost space missions and increased inter-organizational and international
cooperation

* More reliance on advanced spacecraft processing

¢ The introduction of large constellations and, consequently, a more manufac-
turing approach to spacecraft design

Because of budget constraints on the space program as a whole, we expect a
continuing strong emphasis on lower costs for spacecraft and space missions. Small
spacecraft are a natural outcome, including single-purpose small satellites for data
relay or materials processing and large constellations of small satellites for communi-

* The changing direction of future space programs has been discussed by a number of authors,
including Butler [1990], Fogg [1995], Handberg [1995], Harvey [1996], Heiken, et al. [1991],
Hoban [1997], Johnson-Freese [1997], Kay [1995], Launius [1998], Richard Lewis [1990],

cations, space surveillance, or tactical applications. Because of the accelerating use of
onboard processors and miniaturization of many components, small, low-cost satel-
lites will be as capable as older, larger satellites. (See, for example, Sarsfield [1998].)
More people are building and working with LightSats—small, inexpensive spacecraft,
traditionally in low-Earth orbit but moving rapidly outward. As described in Chap. 22,
the technologies used here tend to be nontraditional and far less expensive. LightSats
represent a new way of doing business in space that, if correctly exploited, can drive
down costs by a factor of 2 to 10 with respect to more traditional programs [Wertz and
Larson, 1996].

The biggest technical change in space missions will be the increased use of onboard
processing. Space computers are emerging from infancy, with full-fledged, general-
purpose processors now becoming available. We will use them much more as they
become more economical and begin to duplicate some of the ground processing capa-
bility. As onboard processing increases, spacecraft will take on more complex tasks
and become more autonomous.

Increases in spacecraft autonomy could drive costs either up or down, depending
on the community’s approach to autonomy and software development. We strongly
recommend using software to help lower costs. As shown in Table 23-4, we believe
autonomy in moderation can reduce cost and risk by automating repetitive functions
on the spacecraft while leaving the higher-level functions to ground operations. Every-
day tasks such as telemetry processing, attitude control, and orbit control should be
done autonomously on board, with all of the relevant information attached to the
payload data for downlink to the ground. On the other hand, trying to fully automate
problem solving can be dramatically expensive. So long as the spacecraft is capable of
putting itself in a fail-safe mode, this work is best performed on the ground where
operators can do what they do best—use their intelligence to understand, resolve, and
repair spacecraft problems and respond to changing circumstances.

TABLE 23-4. Development of Low-Cost, Autonomous Systems. The objective of “autonomy
in moderation’ is to automate repetitive tasks and spacecraft safing while allowing
people to identify and fix problems and create long-term plans [Wertz and Larson,
1996].

Functions That Should Be Automated Functions That Should Not Be Automated

* Attitude determination and control ¢ Problem resolution
¢ Orbit determination and control * Identification and implementation of fixes
¢ Payload data processing ¢ One-time activities (e.g., deployment and

* Repetitive housekeeping, e.g., battery check-out)
charging, active thermal control * Long term operations planning

¢ Anomaly recognition ¢ Emergency handling beyond safing
¢ Spacecraft safing

We do not know if proposals to drive down launch costs will succeed in the coming
decade. If launch costs drop significantly, low-cost satellite systems will be possible.
Reducing launch costs will itself drive down spacecraft cost because it will no longer
be worth as much to optimize the spacecraft design or minimize weight [Wertz and
Larson, 1996]. Costs for space exploration would become more consistent with avia-
tion and other commercial activities.

We also expect to see significant changes in space payloads, due both to the
increased level of processing and other factors. In observations and communications,

23.3 Future Trends 891

the use of increased processing capability and array sensors for observations will
greatly increase the capacity of small spacecraft. In addition, a number of new types
of space missions will begin, most notably materials processing in space and other
applications of a microgravity environment. This area is just now beginning and has
enormous growth potential as low-gravity manufacturing processes become better
understood. Much of this will require low-cost access to space and the return of
payloads from space as well.

The commercial communications constellations have also had a major impact on
the process of designing and manufacturing spacecraft [Logsdon, 1995]. Commercial
geosynchronous spacecraft have been manufactured in an assembly line process for
some time. Nonetheless, low-Earth orbit constellations require that the entire constel-
lation be built and launched in a short time in order to allow the system to begin
servicing customers. For example, the Iridium constellation of 66 satellites was
launched in slightly over a year which required satellites to be coming off the assembly
line at an average rate of approximately one per week. This significantly changes the
focus of spacecraft design from performance optimization to high-reliability manufac-
turing. The two contrasting approaches are presented in Chaps. 12 and 19 above. To
the extent that these manufacturing techniques can be applied to other space missions
as well, this should continue to reduce the cost, risk, and schedule of spacecraft devel-
opment. The application of this to spacecraft components is discussed by Zafanella
[1998].

In addition, new constellations like Iridium, Celestri, Globalstar and even the exist-
ing GPS, provide an unprecedented infrastructure that can be used to create new and
more cost-effective space mission architectures. For example having an abundance of
bandwidth available in space can facilitate the movement of data around the world,
thus alleviating the current problems we have with over-subscribed networks, and
changing the way we do missions.

Since the first satellites, space has moved from a very novel activity to a routine
commercial enterprise. Today, on the average, Americans use some form of space as-
set many times per day—weather, television, telephones, navigation, Internet, and
more. Companies are looking for ways to use space and space-related assets to develop
and provide highly marketable products and services. More than ever, companies are
focusing on the end-to-end perspective—providing customers what they need in a
more cost-effective way. For example, recent deregulation of electric utilities in North
America has resulted in regional utilities trying to sell their electricity all over the con-
tinent. One severe problem they face is how to keep track of the customers’ use of elec-
tricity, which has prompted the need for a method of automatically reading utility
meters continentally—from space. The commercial space systems we propose must be
relevant and financially viable, while government space systems must be relevant and
cost-effective.

Today, space exploration depends more on policy, politics, and economics, than on
technological limits. Virtually any mission is now technically possible. We can build
a lunar base, send humans to Mars, develop space colonies and huge solar-powered
satellites, or send manned or unmanned probes to the outer planets. Our limitations are
set by what we choose to do or what we can afford. As environmental problems
become more serious on the Earth’s surface, intelligently using space will become
More important. Yet the use of space resources cannot grow unless we can demon-
strate that we are becoming more efficient and cost effective in our use of space. This
is the challenge for space in the early 21st century.
