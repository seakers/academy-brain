Astrodynamics is the study of a satellite’ s trajectory or orbit, that is, its path through
space. The satellite’s ephemeris is a table listing its position as a function of time. The
first section below explains the terms used to describe satellite orbits, provides equa-
tions necessary to calculate orbital elements from position and velocity, and shows
how to predict the future position and velocity of a satellite. We base this method on
a simple, but accurate, model treating the Earth and the satellite as spherical masses.
The next section discusses how forces other than the Newtonian gravitational force
affect the orbit of a satellite. The third section explains maneuvering strategies used to
change the satellite’s orbit. The final two sections discuss the available launch times
and methods for maintaining satellite orbits.

Several textbooks are available in the areas of satellite orbits and celestial mechan-
ics. Some of the most popular are Bate, Mueller, and White [1971], Battin [1999],
Danby [1962], Escobal [1965], Kaplan [1976], and Roy [1991]. More recently
Chobotov [1996], Wiesel [1996], and Vallado [1997] have provided works specifical-
ly on spacecraft astrodynamics.

6.1 Keplerian Orbits

Explaining the motion of celestial bodies, especially the planets, has challenged
observers for many centuries. The early Greeks attempted to describe the motion of
celestial bodies about the Earth in terms of circular motion. In 1543, Nicolaus Coper-
nicus proposed a heliocentric (Sun-centered) system with the planets following circu-
lar orbits. Finally, with the help of Tycho Brahe’s observational data, Johannes Kepler
described elliptical planetary orbits about the Sun. Later, Isaac Newton provided a
mathematical solution for this system based on an inverse-square gravitational force.

Kepler spent several years reconciling the differences between Tycho Brahe’s care-
ful observations of the planets and their predicted motion based on previous theories.
Having found that the data matched a geometric solution of elliptical orbits, he
published his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609 and his third law in 1619.
Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion (which also apply to satellites orbiting the
Earth) are:

¢ First Law: The orbit of each planet is an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus.

* Second Law: The line joining the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in
equal times.

* Third Law: The square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of
its mean distance from the Sun.

6.1.1 Satellite Equations of Motion

Figure 6-1 depicts the key parameters of an elliptical orbit. The eccentricity, e, of
the ellipse (not shown in the figure) is equal to c/a and is a measure of the deviation of
the ellipse from a circle.

Isaac Newton explained mathematically why the planets (and satellites) follow
elliptical orbits, Newton’s Second Law of Motion, applied to a constant mass system
and, combined with his Law of Universal Gravitation, provides the mathematical basis
for analyzing satellite orbits. Newton’s law of gravitation states that any two bodies
attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them. The equation for the magni-
tude of the force caused by gravity is

F= —GMm/r?
= —um/r (6-1)

where F is the magnitude of the force caused by gravity, G is the universal constant of
gravitation, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the satellite, r is the distance
from the center of the Earth to the satellite, and 1 = GM is the Earth’s gravitational
constant (= 398,600.5 km3s~).

Combining Newton’s second law with his law of gravitation, we obtain an equation
for the acceleration vector of the satellite:

r+ (ue? jr =0 (6-2)

This equation, called the two-body equation of motion, is the relative equation of
motion of a satellite position vector as the satellite orbits the Earth. In deriving it, we
assumed that gravity is the only force, the Earth is spherically symmetric, the Earth’s
mass is much greater than the satellite’s mass, and the Earth and the satellite are the
only two bodies in the system.

A solution to the two-body equation of motion for a satellite orbiting Earth is the
polar equation of a conic section. It gives the magnitude of the position vector in terms
of the location in the orbit,

r=a(l—-e)/(1+ecos v) (6-3)
where a is the semimajor axis, e is the eccentricity, and v is the polar angle or true
anomaly.

A conic section is a curve formed by the intersection of a plane passing through a
right circular cone. As Fig. 6-2 shows, the angular orientation of the plane relative to
the cone determines whether the conic section is a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyper-
bola. We can define all conic sections in terms of the eccentricity, e, in Eq. (6-3)
above. The type of conic section is also related to the semimajor axis, a, and the
specific mechanical energy, & Table 6-1 shows the relationships between energy,
eccentricity, and semimajor axis and the type of conic section.

6.1.2 Constants of Motion

Using the two-body equation of motion, we can derive several constants of motion
of a satellite orbit. The first is

=-y2 _ =
€=V"/2-pl/r=-p/ (Qa) (6-4)

where & is the total specific mechanical energy, or mechanical energy per unit mass,
for the system and is the sum of the kinetic energy per unit mass and potential energy
per unit mass. We refer to Eq. (6-4) as the energy equation. Because the forces in the
system are conservative, the energy is a constant. The term for potential energy, —y/r,
defines the potential energy to be zero at infinity and negative at any radius less than
infinity. Using this definition, the specific mechanical energy of elliptical orbits will
always be negative. As the energy increases (approaches zero), the ellipse gets larger,
and the elliptical trajectory approaches a parabolic trajectory. From the energy
Eq. (6-4), we find that a satellite moves fastest at perigee of the orbit and slowest at
apogee.

6.1 Keplerian Orbits 135

We also know that for a circle the semimajor axis equals the radius, which is
constant. Rearranging the energy equation, we find the velocity of a satellite in a
circular orbit.

V,,, = (w/ ny"? (6-5)
= 7,905 366 (Rp /r)!2
= 631.3481 71?

where FV,

’, 18 the circular velocity in km/s, Re is the Earth’s radius in km, and r is the
orbit’s radius in km.

From Table 6-1, the energy of a parabolic trajectory is zero. A parabolic trajectory
is one with the minimum energy needed to escape the gravitational attraction of Earth.
Thus, we can calculate the velocity required to escape from the Earth at any distance,
r, by setting energy equal to zero in Eq. (6-4) and solving for velocity.

Vie = (Qu /r)!2 (6-6)
= 11.179 88 (Rp/r)
= 892.861] r-2
where V,

Zse 1S the escape velocity in km/s, and r is in km.

Another constant of motion associated with a satellite orbit is the specific angular
momentum, h, which is the satellite’s total angular momentum divided by its mass. We
can find it from the cross product of the position and velocity vectors.

h=r xv (6-7)

We find that from Kepler’s second law, the angular momentum is constant in
magnitude and direction for the two-body problem. Therefore, the orbital plane
defined by the position and velocity vectors must remain fixed in inertial space.

6.1.3 Classical Orbital Elements

When solving the two-body equations of motion, we need six constants of
integration (initial conditions) for the solution. Theoretically, we could find the three
components of position and velocity at any time in terms of the position and velocity
at any other time. Alternatively, we can completely describe the orbit with five
constants and one quantity which varies with time. These quantities, called classical
orbital elements, are defined below and are shown in Fig. 6-3. The coordinate frame
shown in the figure is the geocentric inertial frame,” or GCI, defined in Chap. 5 (see
Table 5-1). Its origin is at the center of the Earth, with the X-axis in the equatorial
plane and pointing to the vernal equinox. Also, the Z-axis is parallel to the Earth’s spin
axis (the North Pole), and the Y-axis completes the right-hand set in the equatorial
plane. The classical orbital elements are:

a: semimajor axis: describes the size of the ellipse (see Fig. 6-1).
e: eccentricity: describes the shape of the ellipse (see Fig. 6-1).

* A sufficiently inertial coordinate frame is a coordinate frame that we can consider to be non-
accelerating for the particular application. The GCI frame is sufficiently inertial when
considering Earth-orbiting satellites, but is inadequate for interplanetary travel because of its
rotational acceleration around the Sun.

136 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.1

i: inclination: the angle between the angular momentum vector and the unit
vector in the Z-direction.

2: right ascension of the ascending node: the angle ftom the vernal equinox to
the ascending node. The ascending node is the point where the satellite passes
through the equatorial plane moving from south to north. Right ascension is
measured as a right-handed rotation about the pole, Z.

@: argument of perigee: the angle from the ascending node to the eccentricity
vector measured in the direction of the satellite’s motion. The eccentricity
vector points from the center of the Earth to perigee with a magnitude equal
to the eccentricity of the orbit.

V: true anomaly: the angle from the eccentricity vector to the satellite position
vector, measured in the direction of satellite motion. Alternately, we could
use time since perigee passage, T.

Fig. 6-3. Definition of the Keplerian Orbital Elements of a Satellite in an Elliptic Orbit. We
define elements relative to the GCI coordinate frame.

Given these definitions, we can solve for the elements if we know the satellite’s
position and velocity vectors. Equations (6-4) and (6-7) allow us to solve for the
energy and the angular momentum vector. An equation for the nodal vector, n, in the
direction of the ascending node is

n=Zxh (6-8)
We can calculate the eccentricity vector from the following equation:
e=(1/w{(V2 —- u/ry)r -(r-v)v} (6-9)

Table 6-2 lists equations to derive the classical orbital elements and related param-
eters for an elliptical orbit.

Equatorial (i = 0) and circular (e = 0) orbits demand alternate orbital elements to
solve the equations in Table 6-2. These are shown in Fig. 6-3. For equatorial orbits, a
single angle, IT, can replace the right ascension of the ascending node and argument
of perigee. Called the longitude of perigee, this angle is the algebraic sum of Q and @.
As i approaches 0, IZ approaches the angle from the X-axis to perigee. For circular

orbits (e = 0), a single angle, u = m+ v, can replace the argument of perigee and true
anomaly. This angle is the argument of latitude and, when e = 0, equals the angle from
the nodal vector to the satellite position vector. Finally, if the orbit is circular and equa-
torial, then a single angle, /, or true longitude, specifies the angle between the X-axis
and the satellite position vector.

6.1.4 Satellite Ground Tracks

As defined in Chap. 5, a satellite’s ground track is the trace of the points formed by
the intersection of the satellite’s position vector with the Earth’s surface. In this section
we will evaluate ground tracks using a flat map of the Earth. Chapters 5 and 7 give
another approach of displaying them on a global representation.

Although ground tracks are generated from the orbital elements, we can gain
insight by determining the orbital elements from a given ground track. Figure 6-4
shows ground tracks for satellites with different orbital altitudes and, therefore, differ-
ent orbital periods. The time it takes Earth to rotate through the difference in longitude
between two successive ascending nodes equals the orbit’s period. For direct orbits, in
which the satellite moves eastward, we measure the change positive to the east. For
retrograde orbits, in which the satellite moves westward, positive is measured to the
west.” With these definitions, the period, P, in minutes is

P=4(360 deg ~-AL) direct orbit (6-10)
P=4(AL — 360 deg) retrograde orbit

+This convenient empirical definition does not apply for near polar orbits. More formally, a
prograde or direct orbit has i < 90 deg. A retrograde orbit has i > 90 deg. A polar orbit has
i= 90 deg.

138 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.1

(For a more precise rotation rate for the Earth, use 3.988 min/deg instead of 4.0 in
these equations.) where AZ is the change in longitude in degrees that the satellite goes
through between successive ascending nodes. The difference in longitude between
two successive ascending nodes for a direct orbit will always be less than 360 deg, and
in fact will be negative for orbits at altitudes higher than geosynchronous altitude. For
retrograde orbits, the difference in longitude between two successive ascending nodes
(positive change is measured to the west) is always greater than 360 deg.

Once we know the period, we can determine the semimajor axis by using the

Figure 6-4 shows one revolution each for the ground tracks of several orbits with
an increasing semimajor axis. The period of a geosynchronous orbit, E, is 1,436 min,
matching the Earth’s rotational motion.

We can determine the orbit’s inclination by the ground track’s maximum latitude.
For direct orbits the inclination equals the ground track’s maximum latitude, and for
retrograde orbits the inclination equals 180 deg minus the ground track’s maximum
latitude.

The orbit is circular if a ground track is symmetrical about both the equator and a
line of longitude extending downward from the ground track’s maximum latitude. All
the orbits in Fig. 6-4 are circular.

Figure 6-5 shows examples of ground tracks for the following typical orbits:

6.1.5 Time of Flight in an Elliptical Orbit

In analyzing Brahe’s observational data, Kepler was able to solve the problem of
relating position in the orbit to the elapsed time, ¢— fp, or conversely, how long it takes
to go from one point to another in an orbit. To solve this, Kepler introduced the quan-
tity M, called the mean anomaly, which is the fraction of an orbit period which has
elapsed since perigee, expressed as an angle. The mean anomaly equals the true anom-
aly for a circular orbit. By definition,

M—Mg=n (t~ ty) (6-12)
where M, is the mean anomaly at time ¢, and x is the mean motion, or average angular
velocity, determined from the semimajor axis of the orbit:

n =(p/a3)2 (6-13)

x 36,173.585 a? deg/s
= 8,681,660.4 a3? rev/day
23.125 2977 x 10°a-3? deg/day

where a is in km.

This solution will give the average position and velocity, but satellite orbits are
elliptical, with a radius constantly varying in orbit. Because the satellite’s velocity
depends on this varying radius, it changes as well. To resolve this problem we define
an intermediate variable called eccentric anomaly, E, for elliptical orbits. Table 6-3
lists the equations necessary to relate time of flight to orbital position.

time of flight t~i=(M —-M))/n (t - tg in sec)

Vv true anomaly v = M+ 2esinM +1.25e2 sin(2M) (approx.)

As an example, we find the time it takes a satellite to go from perigee to an angle
90 deg from perigee, for an orbit with a semimajor axis of 7,000 km and an eccentricity
of 0.1. For this example

Vo =£ = My =0.0 rad fo =0.0s

v = 1.5708 rad E =1.4706 rad

M =1.3711 rad n =0.001 08 rad/s
t =1,271.88s

Finding the position in an orbit after a specified period is more complex. For this
problem, we calculate the mean anomaly, M, using time of flight and the mean motion
using Eq. (6-12). Next, we determine the true anomaly, Vv, using the series expansion
shown in Table 6-3, a good approximation for small eccentricity (the error is of the
order e?). If we need greater accuracy, we must solve the equation in Table 6-3 relating
mean anomaly to eccentric anomaly. Because this is a transcendental function, we
must use an iterative solution to find the eccentric anomaly, after which we can calcu-
late the true anomaly directly.

6.1.6 Orbit Determination

Up to this point, we have assumed that we know both the position and velocity of
the satellite in inertial space or the classical orbital elements. But we often cannot
directly observe the satellite’s inertial position and velocity. Instead, we commonly
receive data from radar, telemetry, optics, or GPS. Radar and telemetry data consists
of range, azimuth, elevation, and possibly the rates of change of one or more of these
quantities, relative to a site attached to the rotating Earth. GPS receivers give GCI
latitude, longitude, and altitude. Optical data consists of right ascension and declina-
tion relative to the celestial sphere. In any case, we must combine and convert this data
to inertial position and velocity before determining the orbital elements. Bate, Mueller,
and White [1971] and Escobal [1965] cover methods for combining data, so I will not
cover them here.

The type of data we use for orbit determination depends on the orbit selected,
accuracy requirements, and weight restrictions on the spacecraft. Because radar and
optical systems collect data passively, they require no additional spacecraft weight,
but they are also the least accurate methods of orbit determination. Conversely, GPS

6.2 Orbit Perturbations 141

data is more accurate but also requires a receiver and processor, which add weight. We
can also use GPS for semiautonomous orbit determination because it requires no
ground support. An alternative method for fully autonomous navigation is given by
Tai and Noerdlinger [1989] (See Sec. 11.2.)

6.2 Orbit Perturbations

The Keplerian orbit discussed above provides an excellent reference, but other
forces act on the satellite to perturb it away from the nominal orbit. We can classify
these perturbations, or variations in the orbital elements, based on how they affect the
Keplerian elements.

Figure 6-6 illustrates a typical variation in one of the orbital elements because of a
perturbing force. Secular variations represent a linear variation in the element. Short-
period variations are periodic in the element with a period less than or equal to the
orbital period. Long-period variations have a period greater than the orbital period.
Because secular variations have long-term effects on orbit prediction (the orbital ele-
ments affected continue to increase or decrease), I will discuss them in detail. If the
satellite mission demands that we precisely determine the orbit, we must include the
periodic variations as well. Battin [1999], Danby [1962], and Escobal [1965] describe
methods of determining and predicting orbits for perturbed Keplerian motion.

Fig. 6-6. Secular and Periodic Variations of an Orbital Element. Secular variations
represent linear variations in the element, short-period variations have a period less
than the orbital period, and long-period variations have a period longer than the orbital
period.

When we consider perturbing forces, the classical orbital elements vary with time.
To predict the orbit we must determine this time variation using techniques of either

142 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.2

special or general perturbations. Special perturbations employ direct numerical inte-
gration of the equations of motion. Most common is Cowell’s method, in which the
accelerations are integrated directly to obtain velocity and again to obtain position.

General perturbations analytically solve some aspects of the motion of a satellite
subjected to perturbing forces. For example, the polar equation of a conic applies to
the two-body equations of motion. Unfortunately, most perturbing forces don’t yield
to a direct analytic solution but to series expansions and approximations. Because the
orbital elements are nearly constant, general perturbation techniques usually solve
directly for the orbital elements rather than the inertial position and velocity. The
orbital elements are more difficult to describe mathematically and approximate, but
they allow us to better understand how perturbations affect a large class of orbits. We
can also obtain solutions much faster than with special perturbations.

The primary forces which perturb a satellite orbit arise from third bodies such as
the Sun and the Moon, the nonspherical mass distribution of the Earth, atmospheric
drag, and solar radiation pressure. We describe each of these below.

6.2.1 Third-Body Perturbations

The gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon cause periodic variations in all of
the orbital elements, but only the right ascension of the ascending node, argument of
perigee, and mean anomaly experience secular variations. These secular variations
arise from a gyroscopic precession of the orbit about the ecliptic pole. The secular vari-
ation in mean anomaly is much smaller than the mean motion and has little effect on
the orbit; however, the secular variations in right ascension of the ascending node and
argument of perigee are important, especially for high-altitude orbits.

For nearly circular orbits, e? is almost zero and the resulting error is of the order e?.
In this case, the equations for the secular rates of change resulting from the Sun and
Moon are:

* Right ascension of the ascending node:

Quoon = -0.003 38 (cosi)/n (6-14)

Asuy = —0.001 54 (cosi)/n (6-15)
¢ Argument of perigee:

yoon = 0.001 69(4 —5 sin? i)/n (6-16)

@syy = 0.000 77(4-5 sin? i)/n (6-17)

where i is the orbital inclination, n is the number of orbit revolutions per day, and Q
and « are in deg/day. These equations are only approximate; they neglect the varia-
tion caused by the changing orientation of the orbital plane with respect to both the
Moon’s orbital plane and the ecliptic plane.

6.2.2, Perturbations Because of a Nonspherical Earth

When developing the two-body equations of motion, we assumed the Earth has a
spherically symmetric mass distribution. In fact, the Earth has a bulge at the equator,

6.2 Orbit Perturbations 143

a slight pear shape, and flattening at the poles. We can find a satellite’s acceleration
by taking the gradient of the gravitational potential function, ®. One widely used form
of the geopotential function is:

® = (p/n) 1- }°5, (Re /n)" A, (sin L) (6-18)
n=2

where pt =GM is Earth’s gravitational constant, R, is Earth’s equatorial radius, P, are
Legendre polynomials, L is geocentric latitude, and J, are dimensionless geopotential
coefficients of which the first three are:

J,= 0.001 082 63
J, = —0.000 002 54
J, = —0.000 001 61

This form of the geopotential function depends on latitude, and we call the geo-
potential coefficients, J,, zonal coefficients. Other, more general expressions for the
geopotential include sectoral and tesseral terms in the expansion. The sectoral terms
divide the Earth into slices and depend only on longitude. The tesseral terms in the
expansion represent sections that depend on longitude and latitude. They divide the
Earth into a checkerboard pattern of regions that alternately add to and subtract from
the two-body potential. A geopotential model consists of a matrix of coefficients in the
spherical harmonic expansion. The widely used Goddard Earth Model 10B, or
GEM 10B, is called a “21 x21 model” because it consists of a 21 x21 matrix of co-
efficients. In order to achieve high accuracy mapping of the ocean surface and wave
properties, the TOPEX mission required creating a 100 x 100 geopotential model.

The potential generated by the nonspherical Earth causes periodic variations in all
of the orbital elements. The dominant effects, however, are secular variations in right
ascension of the ascending node and argument of perigee because of the Earth’s
oblateness, represented by the J, term in the geopotential expansion. The rates of
change of Q and w due to J, are

= —2.064 74 x 10!4a77/? (cosi) (I~ e7)?
@y, = 0.75nJ, (Rg /a)*(4—5sin?i)(1~e*)* (6-20)
= 1.032 37x10!4a~"/?(4—5 sin? i) (1-2)?

where n is mean motion in deg/day, Rx is Earth’s equatorial radius, a is semimajor axis
in km, e is eccentricity, i is inclination, and Q and q@ are in deg/day. Table 6-4
compares the rates of change of right ascension of the ascending node and argument
of perigee resulting from the Earth’s oblateness, the Sun, and the Moon. For satellites
in GEO and below, the J, perturbations dominate; for satellites above GEO the Sun
and Moon perturbations dominate.

Molniya orbits are highly eccentric (e = 0.75) with approximately 12 hour periods
(2 revolutions/day). Orbit designers choose the orbital inclination so the rate of change
of perigee, Eq. (6-20), is zero. This condition occurs at inclinations of 63.4 deg and
116.6 deg. For these orbits we typically place perigee in the Southern Hemisphere, so

the satellite remains above the Northern Hemisphere near apogee for approximately
11 hours/orbit. Mission planners choose perigee altitude to meet the satellite’s mission
constraints. Typical perigee altitudes vary from 200 to 1,000 km. We can calculate the
eccentricity and apogee altitude using the semimajor axis, perigee altitude, and equa-
tions from Table 6-2.

In a Sun-synchronous orbit, the satellite orbital plane remains approximately fixed
with respect to the Sun. We do this by matching the secular variation in the right
ascension of the ascending node (Eq. 6-19) to the Earth’s rotation rate around the Sun.
A nodal precession rate of 0.9856 deg/day will match the Earth’s average rotation rate
about the Sun. Because this rotation is positive, Sun-synchronous orbits must be
retrograde. For a given semimajor axis, a, and eccentricity, we can use Eq. (6-19) to
find the inclination for the orbit to be Sun-synchronous.

6.2.3 Perturbations From Atmospheric Drag

The principal nongravitational force acting on satellites in low-Earth orbit is
atmospheric drag. Drag acts in the opposite direction of the velocity vector and
removes energy from the orbit. This energy reduction causes the orbit to get smaller,

6.2 Orbit Perturbations 145

leading to further increases in drag. Eventually, the altitude of the orbit becomes so
small that the satellite reenters the atmosphere.
The equation for acceleration due to drag on a satellite is:

ap = —(1/2)p (C, Alm) V2 (6-21)

where p is atmospheric density, A is the satellite’s cross-sectional area, m is the satel-
lite’s mass, V is the satellite’s velocity with respect to the atmosphere, and Cp is the
drag coefficient ~ 2.2 (See Table 8-3 in Sec. 8.1.3 for an extended discussion of Cp).

We can approximate the changes in semimajor axis and eccentricity per revolution,
and the lifetime of a satellite, using the following equations:

Aa,., = 2 (CpA/m)a? p, exp (-c) [Jy + 2el,] (6-22)
Ae,e, = 20 (Cp A/m)a p, exp (-c) [h + e (ly +hy/2] (6-23)

where p, is atmospheric density at perigee, c = ae / H, H is density scale height (see
column 25, Inside Rear Cover), and J; are Modified Bessel Functions” of order i and
argument c. We model the term m / (Cp A), or ballistic coefficient, as a constant for
most satellites, although it can vary by a factor of 10 depending on the satellite’s
orientation (see Table 8-3).

For near circular orbits, we can use the above equations to derive the much simpler
expressions:

Aa, oy = —2% (CpA/m)pa? (6-24)
AP 9, = 6%? (Cp A/m)pa?/V (6-25)
AV, = ™ (Cp A/m)pa V (6-26)
Ae, = 0 (6-27)

where P is orbital period and V is satellite velocity.
A rough estimate of the satellite’s lifetime, L, due to drag is

L ¥—H/ Ade, (6-28)

where, as above, H is atmospheric density scale height given in column 25 of the Earth
Satellite Parameter tables in the back of this book. We can obtain a substantially more
accurate estimate (although still very approximate) by integrating Eq. (6-24), taking
into account the changes in atmospheric density with both altitude and solar activity
level. We did this for representative values of the ballistic coefficient in Fig. 8-4 in
Sec. 8.1.

6.2.4 Perturbations from Solar Radiation

Solar radiation pressure causes periodic variations in all of the orbital elements. Its
effect is strongest for satellites with low ballistic coefficients, that is, light vehicles
with large frontal areas such as Echo. The magnitude of the acceleration, ag, in m/s?
arising from solar radiation pressure is

ap® ~4.5 x 106(1 +r) A/m (6-29)

where A is the satellite cross-sectional area exposed to the Sun in m?, mis the satellite
mass in kg, and r is a reflection factor. (x = 0 for absorption; r = 1 for specular

* Values for J, can be found in many standard mathematical tables.

146 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.3

reflection at normal incidence; and r ~ 0.4 for diffuse reflection.) Below 800 km
altitude, acceleration from drag is greater than that from solar radiation pressure;
above 800 km, acceleration from solar radiation pressure is greater.

6.3 Orbit Maneuvering

At some point during the lifetime of most satellites, we must change one or more
of the orbital elements. For example, we may need to transfer it from an initial parking
orbit to the final mission orbit, rendezvous with or intercept another satellite, or correct
the orbital elements to adjust for the perturbations discussed in the previous section.
Most frequently, we must change the orbital altitude, plane, or both. To change the
orbit of a satellite, we have to change the satellite’s velocity vector in magnitude or
direction using a thruster. Most propulsion systems operate for only a short time com-
pared to the orbital period, so we can treat the maneuver as an impulsive change in the
velocity while the position remains fixed. For this reason, any maneuver changing the
orbit of a satellite must occur at a point where the old orbit intersects the new orbit. If
the two orbits do not intersect, we must use an intermediate orbit that intersects both.
In this case, the total maneuver requires at least two propulsive burns.

In general, the change in the velocity vector to go from one orbit to another is
given by

AV = Weep ~ Vourrent (6-30)

We can find the current and needed velocity vectors from the orbital elements,
keeping in mind that the position vector does not change significantly during impul-
sive burns.

6.3.1 Coplanar Orbit Transfers

The most common type of in-plane maneuver changes the size and energy of the
orbit, usually from a low-altitude parking orbit to a higher-altitude mission orbit such
as a geosynchronous orbit. Because the initial and final orbits do not intersect (see.
Fig. 6-7), the maneuver requires a transfer orbit. Figure 6-7 represents a Hohmann"
Transfer Orbit. In this case, the transfer orbit’s ellipse is tangent to both the initial and
final circular orbits at the transfer orbit’s perigee and apogee, respectively. The orbits
are tangential, so the velocity vectors are collinear at the intersection points, and the
Hohmann Transfer represents the most fuel-efficient transfer between two circular,
coplanar orbits. When transferring from a smaller orbit to a larger orbit, the propulsion
system must apply velocity change in the direction of motion; when transferring from
a larger orbit to a smaller, the velocity change is opposite to the direction of motion.

The total velocity change required for the transfer is the sum of the velocity changes
at perigee and apogee of the transfer ellipse. Because the velocity vectors are collinear
at these points, the velocity changes are just the differences in magnitudes of the
velocities in each orbit. We can find these differences from the energy equation, if we
know the size of each orbit. If we know the initial and final orbits (7, and rg), we
calculate the semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse, a,,, and the total velocity change

Alternatively, we can write the total AV required for a two-burn transfer between circular
orbits at radiir, and rg:

where ¥ # = 631.3481 when AV is in km/s and all of the semimajor axes are in km. Asin step |
above, a, = (ry + tp)/ 2.

The above expression applies to any coplanar Hohmann transfer. In the case of small transfers
(that is, 7, close to #), we can approximate this conveniently in two forms:

top

AV =Viy —Vip (6-33)

AV ©0.5 (Ar/r) Vig (6-34)
where

Ar =1p—ry (6-35)
and

rer ® Tp Vig * Vig * Vip (6-36)

To make the orbit change, we divide the AV into two small burns are of approximately equal
magnitude.

The result in Eq. (6-33) is more unusual than it might seem at first. Assume that a satellite is
in a circular orbit with velocity V4. In two burns we increase the velocity by an amount AV’. The
result is that the satellite is higher and traveling s/ower than originally by the amount AV. We
can best clarify this result by an example. Consider a satellite initially in a circular orbit at
400 km such that r, = 6,778 km and V,, = 7,700 m/s. We will apply a total AV of 20 m/s (= 0.26%
of V,,) in two burns of 10 m/s each. From Eq. (6-34) the total Ar will be 0.52% of 6,778 km or
35 km. Thus, the final orbit will be circular at an altitude of 6,813 km. Immediately following
the first burn of 10 m/s the spacecraft will be at perigee of the transfer orbit with a velocity of
7,710 m/s. When the spacecraft reaches apogee at 6,813 km it will have slowed according to
Kepler’s second law by 0.52% to 7,670 m/s. We then apply the second burn of 10 m/s to circu-
larize the orbit at 7,680 m/s which is 20 m/s slower than its original velocity. We have added
energy to the spacecraft which has raised the orbit and resulted in a lower kinetic energy but
sufficiently more potential energy to make up for both the reduced speed and the added AV.

Sometimes, we may need to transfer a satellite between orbits in less time than that
required to complete the Hohmann transfer. Figure 6-8 shows a faster transfer called
the one-tangent burn. In this instance the transfer orbit is tangential to the initial orbit.
It intersects the final orbit at an angle equal to the flight-path angle of the transfer orbit
at the point of intersection. An infinite number of transfer orbits are tangential to the
initial orbit and intersect the final orbit at some angle. Thus, we may choose the trans-
fer orbit by specifying the size of the transfer orbit, the angular change of the transfer,
or the time required to complete the transfer. We can then define the transfer orbit and
calculate the required velocities.

For example, we may specify the size of the transfer orbit, choosing any semimajor
axis that is greater than the semimajor axis of the Hohmann transfer ellipse. Once we
know the semimajor axis of the ellipse (a,,), we can calculate the eccentricity, angular
distance traveled in the transfer, the velocity change required for the transfer, and the
time required to complete the transfer using the equations in Table 6-5.

Hohmann transfer and a one-tangent burn transfer from a low altitude parking orbit to
geosynchronous orbit.

Another option for changing the size of the orbit is to use a constant low-thrust
burn, which results in a spiral transfer. We can approximate the velocity change for
this type of orbit transfer by

Av=|V, -V|| (6-37)

where the velocities are the circular velocities of the two orbits. Following the

previous example, the total velocity change required to go from low-Earth orbit to
geosynchronous is 4.7] km/s using a spiral transfer. We obtain this by subtracting the
results of step 3 from the results of step 2 in the above example.

6.3.2 Orbit Plane Changes

To change the orientation of the satellite’s orbital plane, typically the inclination,
we must change the direction of the velocity vector. This maneuver requires a
component of AV to be perpendicular to the orbital plane and, therefore, perpendicular
to the initial velocity vector. If the size of the orbit remains constant, we call the
maneuver a simple plane change (Fig. 6-9A). We can find the required change in
velocity by using the law of cosines. For the case in which V; is equal to V;, this
expression reduces to

AV=2¥F, sin (0/2) (6-38)

where V, is the velocity before and after the burn, and @ is angle change required.

A. Simple Plane Change B. Combined Plane Change

Fig. 6-9. Vector Representation of Simple and Combined Changes in Orbital Plane. For
the simple plane change, the magnitude of initial and final velocities are equal.

For example, the change in velocity required to transfer from a low-altitude
(A= 185 km) inclined (i = 28 deg) orbit to an equatorial orbit (i = 0) at the same altitude
is:

r= 6,563 km V,= 7.79 km/s AV = 3.77 km/s

From Eq. (6-38) we see that if the angular change equals 60 deg, the required
change in velocity equals the current velocity. Plane changes are very expensive in
terms of the required velocity change and resulting fuel consumption. To minimize
this, we should change the plane at a point where the velocity of the satellite is a
minimum: at apogee for an elliptical orbit. In some cases, it may even be cheaper to
boost the satellite into a higher orbit, change the orbital plane at apogee, and return the
satellite to its original orbit.

6.3 Orbit Maneuvering 151

Typically, orbital transfers require changes in both the size and the plane of the
orbit, such as transferring from an inclined parking orbit at low altitude to a zero-
inclination orbit at geosynchronous altitude. We do this transfer in two steps: a
Hohmann transfer to change the size of the orbit and a simple plane change to make
the orbit equatorial. A more efficient method (less total change in velocity) would be
to combine the plane change with the tangential burn at apogee of the transfer orbit
(Fig. 6-9B). As we must change both the magnitude and direction of the velocity
vector, we can find the required change in velocity using the law of cosines:

AV=(V24V,2 — 2V,V,cos0)!? (6-39)

where V, is the initial velocity, V;is the final velocity, and 0 is the angle change
required.

For example, we find the total change in velocity to transfer from a Shuttle parking
orbit to a geosynchronous equatorial orbit as follows:

r, = 6,563 km rp = 42,159 km
i,= 28 deg iy = 0 deg
V,=7.79 km/s V, = 3.08 km/s
AV, = 2.46 km/s Ab, = 1.83 km/s

AV oraz = 4.29 km/s

Completing a Hohmann transfer followed by a simple plane change would require
a velocity change of 5.44 km/s, so the Hohmann transfer with a combined plane
change at apogee of the transfer orbit represents a savings of 1.15 km/s. As we see
from Eq. (6-39), a small plane change (@ 2 0) can be combined with an energy change
for almost no cost in AV or propellant. Consequently, in practice, we do geosyn-
chronous transfer with a small plane change at perigee and most of the plane change
at apogee.

Another option is to complete the maneuver using three burns. The first burn is a
coplanar maneuver placing the satellite into a transfer orbit with an apogee much
higher than the final orbit. When the satellite reaches apogee of the transfer orbit, it
does a combined plane change maneuver. This places the satellite in a second transfer
orbit which is coplanar with the final orbit and has a perigee altitude equal to the
altitude of the final orbit. Finally, when the satellite reaches perigee of the second
transfer orbit, another coplanar maneuver places the satellite into the final orbit. This
three-burn maneuver may save fuel, but the fuel savings comes at the expense of the
total time required to complete the maneuver.

6.3.3 Orbit Rendezvous

Orbital transfer becomes more complicated when the objective is to rendezvous
with or intercept another object in space: both the interceptor and target must arrive at
the rendezvous point at the same time. This precise timing demands a phasing orbit to
accomplish the maneuver. A phasing orbit is any orbit which results in the interceptor
achieving the desired geometry relative to the target to initiate a Hohmann transfer. If
the initial and final orbits are circular, coplanar, and of different sizes, then the phasing
orbit is simply the initial interceptor orbit (Fig. 6-10). The interceptor remains in the
initial orbit until the relative motion between the interceptor and target results in the

152 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.3

desired geometry. At that point, we inject the interceptor into a Hohmann transfer
orbit. The equation to solve for the wait time in the initial orbit is:

Wait Time = (4; — $y + 2k) Quy, — Og)) (6-40)

where @, 1s the phase angle (angular separation of target and interceptor) needed for
rendezvous, @; is the initial phase angle, k is the number of rendezvous opportunities,
(for the first opportunity, k = 0), ;,,is the angular velocity of the interceptor, and @.,

is the angular velocity of the target. We calculate the lead angle, a,, by multiplying
,, by the time of flight for the Hohmann transfer and ¢, is 180 deg minus a.

Fig. 6-10. Geometry Depicting Rendezvous Between Two Circular, Coplanar Orbits. The
phase angle is the angular separation between the target and interceptor at the start
of the rendezvous and the lead angle is the distance the target travels from the start
until rendezvous occurs.

The total time to rendezvous equals the wait time from Eq. (6-40) plus the time of
flight of the Hohmann transfer orbit.

The denominator in Eq. (6-40) represents the relative motion between the inter-
ceptor and target. As the size of the interceptor orbit approaches the size of the target
orbit, the relative motion approaches zero, and the wait time approaches infinity. If the
two orbits are exactly the same, then the interceptor must enter a new phasing orbit to
rendezvous with the target (Fig. 6-11). For this situation, the rendezvous occurs at the
point where the interceptor enters the phasing orbit. The period of the phasing orbit
equals the time it takes the target to get to the rendezvous point. Once we know the
period, we can calculate the semimajor axis. The two orbits are tangential at their point
of intersection, so the velocity change is the difference in magnitudes of the two
velocities at the point of intersection of the two orbits. Because we know the size of
the orbits, and therefore, the energies, we can use the energy Eq. (6-4) to solve for the
current and needed velocities.

Frequently operators must adjust the relative phasing for satellites in circular orbits.
They accomplish this by making the satellite drift relative to its initial position. The
drift rate in deg/orbit is given by

drift rate = 1,080 AV/V (6-41)

where V is the nominal orbital velocity and AV is the velocity change required to start
or stop the drift.

The techniques described above move the target vehicle close to the interceptor.
Once the two vehicles are close to each other they begin proximity operations by solv-
ing a set of relative motion equations to achieve the final rendezvous. Vallado [1997]
contains an excellent discussion of the solution to the nearby relative motion problem,
as addressed by the Clohessy- Wiltshire or Hill’s equations of relative motion.

6.4 Launch Windows

Similar to the rendezvous problem is the launch-window problem, or determining
the appropriate time to launch from the surface of the Earth into the desired orbital
plane. Because the orbital plane is fixed in inertial space, the launch window is the
time when the launch site on the surface of the Earth rotates through the orbital plane.
As Fig. 6-12 shows, the launch time depends on the launch site’s latitude and longi-
tude and the satellite orbit’s inclination and right ascension of the ascending node.

For a launch window to exist, the launch site must pass through the orbital plane.
This requirement places restrictions on the orbital inclinations, i, possible from a
given launch latitude, L:

* No launch windows exist if L > i for direct orbit or L > 180 deg — i for
retrograde orbits.

¢ One launch window exists if L = ior L = 180 deg —i.
¢ Two launch windows exist if L <7 or L < 180 deg ~/.

The launch azimuth, B, is the angle measured clockwise from north to the velocity
vector. If a launch window exists, then the launch azimuth required to achieve an
inclination, i, from a given launch latitude, L, is’given by:

154 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.4

latitude (L), and launch azimuth (f).

and
V_cos B, Vv,
tany = ———_———__ = | — |cos
mY Vy — Vig COSi VY cosB (6-42c)

where V, is the inertial velocity of the launch site given by Eq. (6-46) below,
Veq = 464.5 m/s is the velocity of Earth’s rotation at the equator, and V, = 7.8 km/s is
the velocity of the satellite immediately after launch. G, is the inertial launch azimuth
and y is a small correction to account for the velocity contribution caused by Earth’s
rotation. For launches to low-Earth orbit, y ranges from 0 for a due east launch to 3.0
deg for launch into a polar orbit. The approximation for y in Eq. (6-42c) is accurate to
within 0.1 deg for low-Earth orbits. For launches near the ascending node, B is in the
first or fourth quadrant and the plus sign applies in Eq. (6-42a). For launches near the
descending node, f is in the second or third quadrant and the minus sign applies in
Eq. (6-42a).

Let 5, shown in Fig. 6-12, be the angle in the equatorial plane from the nearest node
to the longitude of the launch site. We can determine 6 from:

cos 6 =cos B/sini (6-43)
where 6is positive for direct orbits and negative for retrograde orbits. Finally, the local

sidereal time, LST, of launch is the angle from the vernal equinox to the longitude of
the launch site at the time of launch:

LST = Q+6 (launch at the ascending node)
= 2+180deg—6 (launch at the descending node) (6-44)

where £2 is the right ascension of the ascending node of the resulting orbit.

6.5 Orbit Maintenance 155

Having calculated the launch azimuth required to achieve the desired orbit, we can
now calculate the velocity needed to accelerate the payload from rest at the launch site
to the required burnout velocity. To do so, we use topocentric-horizon coordinates
with velocity components V5, V;, Vz:

K= -h, cos cos B, (6-45a)
V, = V,, cos @ sin B, — V, (6-45b)
V,=V,,sin @ (6-45c)

where V,,, is the velocity at burnout (usually equal to the circular orbital velocity at the
prescribed altitude), ¢ is the flight path angle at burnout, f, is the launch azimuth at
bumout, and V, is the velocity of the launch site at a given latitude, L, as given by:

V, = (464.5 m/s) cos L (6-46)

Equations (6-45c) do not include losses in the velocity of the launch vehicle be-
cause of atmospheric drag and gravity—approximately 1,500 m/s for a typical launch
vehicle. Also, in Eq. (6-45c) we assume that the azimuth at launch and the azimuth at
burnout are the same. Changes in the latitude and longitude of the launch vehicle
during powered flight will introduce small errors into the calculation of the burnout
conditions. We can calculate the velocity required at burnout from the energy equation
if we know the semimajor axis and radius of burnout of the orbit [Eq. (6-4)].

6.5 Orbit Maintenance

Once in their mission orbits, many satellites need no additional orbital adjustments.
On the other hand, mission requirements may demand that we maneuver the satellite
to correct the orbital elements when perturbing forces have changed them. Two par-
ticular cases of note are satellites with repeating ground tracks and geosynchronous
equatorial satellites, placed at an assigned longitude.

Using two-body equations of motion, we can show that a satellite will have a
repeating ground track if it has exactly an integer number of revolutions per integer
number of days. Its period, therefore, must be:

P = (m sidereal days) / (k revolutions) (6-47)

where m and k are integers, and | sidereal day = 1,436.068 167 min. For example, a
satellite orbiting the Earth exactly 16 times per day has a period of 89.75 min and a
semimajor axis of 6,640 km.

Next we would modify the period of the satellite to account for the drift in the
orbital plane caused by the Earth’s oblateness (/;). We can calculate the change in the
right ascension of the ascending node, AQ, because of J, from the two-body orbital
elements. In this case the new period is:

Pyew = Prworopy + AQ gant (6-48)

Because we base the nodal drift on the two-body orbital elements, we must iterate
to find the new orbital period and semimajor axis. Continuing with the previous exam-
ple, assume a perigee altitude of 120 km and an inclination of 45 deg. In this case, we
find that the compensated period is 88.20 min and the new semimajor axis is 6,563 km.

Several examples of spacecraft placed in orbits with repeating ground tracks are
shown in Table 6-7.

The Earth’s oblateness also causes the direction of perigee to rotate around the
orbit. If the orbit is noncircular and the mission places limits on the altitude over
specific targets, we must control the location of perigee. One possibility is to select the
inclination of the orbit to be at the critical inclination (63.4 deg for a direct orbit and
116.4 deg for a retrograde orbit), so the location of perigee is fixed. If other constraints
make this selection impossible, we must maintain the orbit through orbital maneuvers.
We can change the location of perigee by changing the flight-path angle by an angle
9. Only the direction of the velocity vector changes, so we can find the change in ve-
locity from the equation for a simple plane change:

AV=2V sin 6/2 (6-49)

A final consideration for a low-altitude orbit with repeating ground tracks is the
change in the semimajor axis and eccentricity due to atmospheric drag. Drag causes
the orbit to become smaller. As the orbit becomes smaller, the period also decreases,
causing the ground track to appear to shift eastward. If we specify some tolerance,
such as a maximum distance between the actual and desired ground tracks, the satellite
must periodically maneuver to maintain the desired orbit.

We can use Eq. (6-22) to calculate the change in semimajor axis per revolution of
the orbit. Given the change in the size of the orbit, we can also determine the change
in the period:

AP = 3x Aa/(na) (6-50)

If constraints exist for either the period or semimajor axis of the orbit, we can use
Eqs. (6-22) and (6-50) to keep track of the period and semimajor axis until we need to
correct the orbit. We can apply a tangential velocity change at perigee to adjust the
semimajor axis when required. Again, we can find the current and needed velocities
from the energy Eq. (6-4), because we know the size, and therefore the energy, of the
two orbits.

Geosynchronous equatorial orbits also require orbital maintenance maneuvers. Sat-
ellites in these orbits drift when perturbations occur from the nonspherical Earth and
from the third-body gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon. Matching the period
of a geostationary orbit with the Earth’s rotational velocity results in a resonance with
the J,, term in the geopotential. This resonance term results in a transverse accelera-
tion, that is, an acceleration in the plane of the orbit. This causes the satellite to drift in
longitude (East-West drift). The Sun and the Moon cause out-of-plane accelerations
which make the satellite drift in latitude (North-South drift).

North-south stationkeeping is necessary when mission requirements limit inclina-
tion drift. If not corrected, the inclination of the orbit varies between 0 and 15 deg with
a period of approximately 55 years. The approximate equations to solve for the worst-
case change in velocity are:

6.5 Orbit Maintenance 157

AVuoon = 102.67 cos & sin & (m/s/yr) (6-51)
= 36.93 m/s per year, for i= 0
AVsuy = 40.17 cos ¥ sin y (m/s/yr) (6-52)

= 14.45 m/s/yr, for i=0

where is the angle between the orbital plane and the Moon’s orbit, and yis the angle
between the orbital and ecliptic plane.

The transverse acceleration caused by resonance with the J,, term results in peri-
odic motion about either of two stable longitudes at approximately 75 deg and 255 deg
East longitude. If we place a satellite at any other longitude, it will tend to orbit the
closest of these two longitudes, resulting in East-West drift of up to 180 deg with
periods of up to 900 days. Suppose a mission for a geostationary satellite specifies a
required longitude, [p. The change in velocity required to compensate for the drift and
maintain the satellite in the vicinity of the specified longitude is:

AV= 1.715 sin (2 |p - J,) (6-53)

where I, is the desired longitude, J, is the closest stable longitude, and AVis in m/s/yr.
For example, we find the velocity change required for one year if the desired lon-
gitude is 60 deg west as

L, =-60deg [, = 255 deg
AV = 1.715 m/s/yr

After the mission of the satellite is complete, several options exist, depending on
the orbit. We may allow low-altitude orbits to decay and reenter the atmosphere or use
a velocity change to speed up the process. We may also boost satellites at all altitudes
into benign orbits to reduce the probability of collision with active payloads,
especially at synchronous altitudes or when the satellite is part of a large constellation.
Because coplanar velocity changes are more efficient than plane changes, we would
normally apply tangential changes in velocity. Their magnitude would depend on the
difference in energy of the two orbits. Generally, a change in altitude of a few hundred
kilometers is sufficient to prevent collisions within a constellation. If we increase the
altitude of the orbit for disposal, we must make sure atmospheric drag does not cause
the disposal orbit to decay and return the spacecraft to the original altitude of the con-
stellation. If we choose to deorbit our satellite, the velocity change required to deorbit
a satellite in a circular orbit at initial altitude, H;, and velocity, V, is:

AV, = VIR _2(Ret He)
deorbit 2Ry + Hy + Hi (6-54a)
e 1
A,- H.
= V L é€
Eee + | (6-54b)

where R; is the radius of the Earth and H, is the perigee altitude at the end of the burn.
It is not necessary to reduce perigee altitude to 0 km. Choosing a 50 km deorbit
altitude would reduce the FireSat AVjeorpi, to 183 m/s. Note that we reduce only

perigee in the deorbit burn. Reducing perigee to 100 to 150 km could result in several
orbits over which apogee decreases before the spacecraft reenters and might not allow
adequate control of the deorbit conditions.
