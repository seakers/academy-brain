1.4 Step 2: Preliminary Estimate of Mission Needs,
Requirements, and Constraints

Space mission analysis and design begins with one or more broad objectives and
constraints and then proceeds to define a space system that will meet them at the
lowest possible cost. Broad objectives and constraints are the key to this process.
Procurement plans for space systems too often substitute detailed numerical require-
ments for broad mission objectives. To get the most performance for the money spent,
we must require of the system only what it can reasonably achieve. Thus, while our
overall objectives to communicate, navigate, or observe will generally remain the
same, we will achieve these objectives differently as technology and our understand-
ing of the process and problem evolve. This chapter summarizes, and the book as a
whole details, this process of defining and refining both what is to be done and what
mission concept will do it at the lowest cost.

There are now a number of references available on the mission design process and
the definition of mission objectives. Rechtin [1991] and Ruskin and Estes [1995]
provide general discussions of this process. Shishko [1995] provides an overview from
the NASA perspective and Przemieniecki [1993] gives a similar treatment for defense
missions. Davidoff [1998] and Wertz and Larson [1996] discuss this process from the
perspective of very low-cost missions and methods for dramatically reducing mission
cost, respectively. Boden and Larson [1996] discuss the analysis and design process
specifically for mission operations. Finally, Kay [1995] examines the fundamental
difficulty of doing technical trades within a democratic political environment.

1.1 Introduction and Overview

Table 1-1 summarizes our approach to the space mission analysis and design
process. Space missions range widely from communications, to planetary exploration,
to proposals for space manufacturing, to burial in space. No single process can fully
cover all contingencies, but the method in Table 1-1 summarizes a practical approach
evolved over the first 40 years of space exploration.

2 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 11

Space is expensive. Cost is a fundamental limitation to nearly all space missions
and is becoming more so. Consequently, this and subsequent tables reflect the assess-
ment of each author on how things traditionally have been done and how they should
be done differently, both to lower cost and to achieve the greatest return from the space
investment.

Analysis and design are iterative, gradually refining both the requirements and
methods of achieving them. Thus, we must repeat the broad process defined in
Table 1-1 many times for each mission. The first several iterations may take only a
day, but more detailed assessments will take far longer.

Successive iterations through Table 1-1 will usually lead to a more detailed, better-
defined space mission concept. But we must still return regularly to the broad mission
objectives and search for ways to achieve them at a lower cost. In defining and refining
the approach, there is strong pressure to proceed to ever greater detail, and never revise
a decision once it has been made. Although we must maintain orderly progress, we
must also review the mission design regularly for better ways to achieve the mission
objectives. Methods may change as a result of evolving technology, a new understand-
ing of the problem, or simply fresh ideas and approaches as more individuals become
involved.

Finally, we must document the results of this iterative process. If we wish to go
back and reexamine decisions as new data becomes available, we must clearly under-
stand and convey to others the reasons for each decision. We need this documentation
for decisions based on detailed technical analyses, and, equally important, for those
based on simplicity, ease of assessment, or political considerations.

This book presents many examples from real space missions. To illustrate the
mission analysis and design process without being tied to existing space systems, we
invented the hypothetical FireSat space mission. Figure 1-1 shows the broad mission
statement we used to begin the process of space mission design for FireSat. We wish

11 Introduction and Overview 3

to stress that the parameters developed throughout the book are by no means the only
possible set for FireSat, nor necessarily the best. To show how solutions may vary,
Chap. 22 presents a very low-cost spacecraft as an alternative for FireSat. Our example
system simply illustrates the iterative process of space mission analysis and design.
Different assumptions, requirements, or proposed solutions may lead to dramatically
different results.

FireSat
Mission Statement

Because forest fires have an increasing impact on recreation and
commerce and ever higher public visibility, the United States needs a
more effective system to identify and monitor them. In addition, it would
be desirable (but not required) to monitor forest fires for other nations;

collect statistical data on fire outbreaks, spread, speed, and duration; and
provide other forest management data.

Ultimately, the Forest Service’s fire-monitoring office and rangers in the
field will use the data. Data flow and formats must meet the needs of both
groups without specialized training and must allow them to respond
promptly to changing conditions.

Fig. 1-1. Origin of the Hypothetical FireSat Mission. FireSat is used as the primary example
throughout this book.

To illustrate the broad process of Table 1-1, we will go through each of the top-
level steps for the FireSat mission and indicate the type of information that needs to be
developed:

In Step 1, we define what the mission needs to achieve. What are our qualitative
goals, and why? This information should come largely from the mission statement of
Fig. 1-1. We need to return to this broad goal over and over to ask whether we are
doing what we set out to do.

Step 2 is significantly different. It quantifies how well we wish to achieve the
broad objectives, given our needs, applicable technology, and cost constraints. These
quantitative requirements should be subject to trade as we go along. A major error in
many space-system procurements is to set requirements in concrete at a relatively
early stage. An example for FireSat might be a 100 m positioning accuracy for initial
fire detection. A 100 m requirement seems to be a reasonable place to start, but
compared to an accuracy of 200 m, it could add tens or even hundreds of millions of
dollars to the overall system cost. We might spend this extra money better in acquiring
fire detection airplanes, providing more personnel on the ground, or using better fire-
fighting technology. Congress, the Department of the Interior, and the Forest Service
must ultimately decide how well FireSat should do and at what cost. Space mission
analysis and design provides the quantitative data needed to support such decisions.

Our next step is to define and characterize a space mission to meet the objectives.
Step 3 begins this process by developing alternative mission concepts. A mission
concept or concept of operations is a broad statement of how the mission will work in
practice. It includes issues such as how the data will be sensed and delivered to the end
user, how the mission will be controlled, and the overall mission timeline. Alternative
mission concepts include, for example, conceptually distinct approaches to the prob-
lem such as the very low-cost approach defined in Chap. 22. These would also include

4 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 11

different orbits or different wavelength bands for fire detection that would require
dramatically dissimilar systems.

Step 4 defines alternate combinations of mission elements or the space mission
architecture to meet the requirements of the mission concept. The space mission
architecture is the mission concept plus a definition of each of the elements of the
mission shown in Fig. 1-3 (Sec. 1.2). A good way to begin Step 4 is to look at the
mission elements in Fig. 1-3 and consider what alternatives for each of them would
best meet mission objectives.

In any real system, many things influence overall cost, performance, or the design
of detailed components. However, these are influenced mainly by a relatively small
number of key parameters or components, called drivers. Thus, there may be cost,
performance, or system drivers which affect the design of the overall space system. In
Step 5 we identify the principal cost and performance drivers for each alternative
mission concept. For most space missions, system drivers include the number of
satellites, altitude, power, and instrument size and weight. (Sec. 2.3 gives a more
detailed list.) By explicitly identifying the system drivers, we can concentrate our
effort on parameters having the most impact on the design and therefore on the cost of
the space mission. This method improves our chances of getting the best possible
design within the available budget.

Step 6 is typically the most involved in mission design because it defines in detail
what the system is and does. Here we determine the power, weight, and pointing
budgets* and decide what to process on the ground or in space. Characterizing the
mission is the most costly step because it requires the expertise of many people.
Developing detail is always comforting in managing any design process but, as noted
earlier, we must take care not to overdo details while characterizing the mission.
System-level requirements and trades must remain our primary focus.

The next step in mission analysis and design is to evaluate the systems we have
defined. Having defined and characterized alternative mission concepts, we return in
Step 7 to our initial quantitative requirements and identify the critical requirements,*
that is, the key requirements principally responsible for determining the cost and
complexity of the system. Recall that the system drivers are those defining parameters,
such as altitude or payload aperture, which most strongly affect the cost, performance,
and system design. System drivers are not normally system requirements. However, a
critical requirement for coverage or resolution may result in altitude and aperture
becoming performance or system drivers. The implication of this for mission analysis
and design is that we must put substantial effort into understanding the quantitative
relationship between, for example, altitude, aperture, coverage, and resolution, in
order to set intelligently both the requirements (coverage and resolution) and system
parameters (altitude and aperture). For FireSat, the critical requirements might be fire
location accuracy, resolution, coverage, or timeliness of the data. We should concen-
trate on these requirements to determine how firm they are, how good we should make
them, and how much we will pay for them to achieve our broad objectives. Critical
requirements may differ for alternative mission concepts.

* A budget is a numerical list of the components of any overall system parameter. Thus, the total
spacecraft weight budget would consist of the weights assigned to the payload instruments,
the various subsystems, the propellant required, and typically some margin for growth.

¥ In the first and second editions of this book, critical requirements were called driving require-
ments. We changed the terminology to avoid confusion with the system drivers of Step 5.

11 Introduction and Overview 5

The above questions form the basis of mission utility analysis, Step 8, in which we
quantify how well we are meeting both the requirements and the broad objectives as a
function of either cost or key system-design choices. We would like to provide the
decision maker a single chart of potential performance vs. cost. More typically, we
must settle for something less ideal, such as the percent of fires detected within 2 hours
vs. the aperture of the instrument, or the delay time in detecting forest fires vs. altitude
and the number of satellites in the constellation. Only the user or developer of the sys-
tem can ultimately determine the goodness of these critical performance measures,
called Measures of Effectiveness or Figures of Merit. Consequently, mission definition
must be to some degree a joint process between those who understand the mission
analysis and design process and those who eventually must use the system or justify
its cost.

Having evaluated alternative designs and done a preliminary assessment of mission
utility, we select one or more baseline system designs in Step 9. A baseline design is
a single consistent definition of the system which meets most or all of the mission
objectives. A consistent system definition is a single set of values for all of the system
parameters which fit with each other—e.g., resolution and coverage rates which cor-
respond to the assigned altitude, aperture, and resulting spacecraft weight. In actually
designing a space system, many parameters are being defined and changed simulta-
neously. The baseline provides a temporary milestone against which to measure
progress. It also allows us to limit the number of options which must be evaluated.
Rather than looking at all possible combinations of altitude, aperture, power, and
spectral band (a nearly impossible task), it is much more feasible to look at the impact
of varying each of these individually relative to one or two baseline designs. As the
system design matures, the baseline becomes more firm, and eventually becomes the
system design. However, we should always remember that the baseline is only a start-
ing point for the iterative trade process and should not be regarded as an ironclad
definition of mission parameters.

Because builders of a space system work from specific requirements, we must
translate the broad objectives and constraints of the mission into well-defined system
requirements in Step 10. In Step 11, we flow down or allocate these numerical
requirements to the components of the overall space mission in the same way that a
budget allocates weight and power to the spacecraft’s components. The final list of
detailed requirements reflects how well we have done the job of space mission
analysis, design, and allocation.

1.1.1 Changes in Future Space Missions

The way we analyze and design space missions is itself continually evolving. In
particular, we expect major changes in this process because of increasing techno-
logical maturity, increasing use of onboard processing, and continuing emphasis on
low-cost missions.

Technological limits on space exploration are giving way to those of policies,
politics, and economics. Nearly any mission is technically feasible. It is well within
our technical capacity to build a lunar base, mount manned explorations to Mars or
other planets, create an industrial base in space, or build networks of satellites to
provide truly global communications and observations. Our activity in space depends
on what we can afford to do or what we choose to do. Therefore, we must carefully
analyze why we choose to use or explore space. We must select each space mission,
not just to achieve something that could not have been done before, but to achieve
something that should be done or is worth doing.

6 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.1

A major technological change in future space missions will be increased use of
onboard computers. Space system developers have been very slow to use computers
because of the conservative approach to spacecraft design, long lead times in space-
craft production, and very real difficulties associated with running a computer reliably
in space.* The shift to increased onboard processing is moving spacecraft toward more
autonomy and increased complexity in terms of the tasks they undertake. Whether this
change drives space costs up or down depends upon the government and industry’s
approach to autonomy and software development for space. Spacecraft may follow the
example of ground systems, carrying either low-cost commercial systems or vastly
more expensive but more capable special purpose systems.

We anticipate continuing emphasis on low-cost spacecraft. Small spacecraft will
increase for future space missions. These could be either individual, single-purpose,
small satellites or large constellations of small satellites used for communications,
space-based radar, or tactical applications. Again, the community appears to be divid-
ing into those who can build small, low-cost spacecraft and those who continue to
build large, expensive systems. Creating LightSats represents a new ethic and a new
way of doing business in space. If the space business is to grow and prosper as com-
mercial aviation has, we must find a way to reduce the costs of using space. Lowering
cost is the real challenge for space mission analysis and design, as well as the govern-
ment and industrial groups which have created and used this process.

Finally, the mission concept and associated space mission architecture largely
determine the cost, complexity, and efficiency of the overall system, This is com-
pounded greatly when you begin to consider integrating the operational aspects of
many different missions. For example, today within DoD, we have communication,
navigation, signal intelligence, reconnaissance, and weather systems; each with their
own mission concept and architecture. The upcoming challenge is to find ways for
these systems to operate together to meet user needs.

The fundamental question is ““Who are the customers, and what products or services
do they require?” In trying to answer this we find ourselves dealing with information-
related issues: What information is required, where, and in what form? Most
customers don’t care about the existence of communications, navigation, or weather
satellites. They need specific information and are not interested in what systems
provide it. Today’s challenge is to blend the capabilities and information available
from multiple systems to meet customer needs. Military people often express this as
tasking, processing, interpretation, and dissemination, whereas commercial people
often express the same issues as customer requests processing, formatting, and
delivery.

Figure 1-3 is divided along somewhat arbitrary, functional boundaries. We need to
find ways to dissolve these artificial boundaries and create cost-effective solutions to
our customer’s information needs. For example, instead of trying to integrate the
separate systems discussed above, we might consider having multimission payloads
and spacecraft that have the ability to gather intelligence information, weather, and
provide navigation using one payload—multimission payloads.

An alternative to creating multimission payloads is to divide the architecture
differently by placing all sensors on one space asset, processing capability on another

* Space computers are far more susceptible than ground computers to single-event upsets caused
by the high-radiation environment or randomly occurring cosmic rays. To protect against this
damage, we must design computers specifically for use in space, as described in Chap. 16.

1.2 The Space Mission Life Cycle 7

and using existing or proposed communications links to move the information around.
A third alternative might be to use a series of low-cost LightSats each doing a separate
function, but in such a way that the end results can be easily and directly integrated by
the user’s equipment on the ground.

These examples provide a slightly different perspective which is difficult for many
organizations, both industrial and government, to adopt because we think and organize
functionally—tlaunch, spacecraft, operations, and so on. Being able to functionally
decompose our missions and divide them into workable pieces has been one of the
reasons, for our success. On the other hand, if we think only functionally it may cause
significant problems. We must also think horizontally and create systems that can be
integrated with other space and ground systems to create capabilities that are greater
than the sum of their parts. As always, our goal is to meet the total user needs at
minimum cost and risk.

1.2 The Space Mission Life Cycle

Table 1-2 illustrates the life cycle of a space mission, which typically progresses
through four phases:

* Concept exploration, the initial study phase, which results in a broad definition
of the space mission and its components.

¢ Detailed development, the formal design phase, which results in a detailed
definition of the system components and, in larger programs, development of
test hardware or software.

¢ Production and deployment, the construction of the ground and flight hard-
ware and software and launch of the first full constellation of satellites.

* Operations and support, the day-to-day operation of the space system, its
maintenance and support, and finally its deorbit or recovery at the end of the
mission life.

These phases may be divided and named differently depending on whether the
sponsor—the group which provides and controls the program budget—is DoD,
NASA, one of the many international organizations, or a commercial enterprise. The
time required to progress from initial concept to deorbiting or death of the space asset
appears to be independent of the sponsor. Large, complex space missions typically
require 10 to 15 years to develop and operate from 5 to 15 years, whereas small,
relatively simple missions require as few as 12 to 18 months to develop and operate
for 6 months to several years.

Procurement and operating policies and procedures vary with the sponsoring
organization, but the key players are the same: the space mission operator, end user or
customer, and developer. Commercial space missions are customer driven. The main
difference between users and customers is that customers usually pay for a service,
whereas users receive services that others pay for. Operators control and maintain the
space and ground assets, and are typically applied engineering organizations. End
users receive and use the products and capability of the space mission. They include
astronomers and physicists for science missions, meteorologists for weather missions,
you and me for communication and navigation missions, geologists and agronomists
for Earth resources missions, and the war fighter for offensive and defensive military

space missions. The developer is the procuring agent, be it government or a commer-
cial enterprise, and includes the contractors, subcontractors, and government develop-
ment, and test organizations. The operators and users must generate technically and
fiscally responsible requirements; the developer must provide the necessary product
or capability on time and within changing political and funding constraints.

Three basic activities occur during the Concept Exploration Phase (see Fig. 1-2).
Users and operators develop and coordinate a set of broad needs and performance
objectives based on an overall concept of operations. At the same time, developers
generate alternative concepts to meet the perceived needs of the user and operating
community. In addition, the sponsor performs long-range planning, develops an
overall program structure, and estimates budgetary needs and available funding to
meet the needs of the users, operators, and developers. In order to be successful in pro-
ducing and deploying a new space capability, the four key players in this activity must
closely integrate their areas of responsibility.

This book emphasizes the concept exploration phase which further divides into
needs analysis and concept development, as detailed in Table 1-3. The goal during
concept exploration is to assess the need for a space mission and to develop affordable
alternatives that meet operator and end-user requirements. The Needs Analysis is a

continuing process which culminates in a new program start. Operators and end users
develop potential mission requirements based on the considerations shown in the left-
hand column of Table 1-3. The process is different for each organization, but at some
point a new program begins with a set of mission objectives, concept of operations,
and desired schedule. In DoD, the Mission Needs Statement documents this informa-
tion and becomes part of the planning, programming, and budgeting system [Defense
Systems Management College, 1990]. If approved, the program receives funding and
proceeds to concept development.

At the Program Initiation milestone, the funding organization commits to pro-
ceeding through concept development. The program will receive different levels of
scrutiny depending on its scope, political interest, and funding requirements. In DoD,
programs classed as major programs receive the utmost attention at the highest levels
of the Defense Department. Various components of the military use distinct criteria to
identify major programs [Defense Systems Management College, 1990]. A DoD crit-
ical requirements program is “major” if it requires more than $200 million in research,
development, test, and evaluation funds or more than $1 billion in production costs.
Programs that require participation by more than one component of the armed forces
or have congressional interest may also be classified as major programs.

During Concept Development the developer must generate alternative methods of
meeting the operator’s and end user’s needs. This procedure includes developing and
assessing different concepts and components for mission operations, as well as

TABLE 1-3. Further Breakdown of Concept Exploration Phase. During concept exploration
the operator and end users define their needs and requirements and pass them to
the developing organization for concept development. A basic premise of this book
is that the operator, user, and developer should work together to create realistic and
affordable mission objectives and requirements that meet user needs.

estimating the factors shown in the right-hand column of Table 1-3. The information
becomes part of an overall system concept. High-level managers in the user, operator,
and development communities evaluate whether the concepts, initial mission objec-
tives, and potential requirements meet the mission’s intentions. If the program satisfies
the need at a reasonable cost, it passes the Requirements Validation milestone and
proceeds into the Detailed Development Phase.

This book provides the technical processes and information necessary to explore
concepts for many space missions. Table 1-3 identifies a major concern that can
undermine the entire process: in many cases, users and operators analyze the needs and
formulate mission requirements apart from the development community. Then they
pass these requirements “over the wall” without negotiating. The developer often
generates alternatives without the operators and users. These autonomous actions
produce minimum performance at maximum cost.

To explore a concept successfully, we must remove the walls
between the sponsor, space operators, users or customers, and
developers and become a team.

A good team considers the mission’s operations, objectives, and requirements as
well as the available technology to develop the best possible mission concept at the
lowest possible life-cycle cost.

All space missions consist of a set of elements or components as shown in
Fig. 1-3. The arrangement of these elements form a space mission architecture.
Various organizations and programs define their mission elements differently,
although all of the elements are normally present in any space mission.

The subject of the mission is the thing which interacts with or is sensed by the space
payload: moisture content, atmospheric temperature, or pressure for weather missions;
types of vegetation, water, or geological formations for Earth-sensing missions; or a
rocket or intercontinental ballistic missile for space defense missions. We must decide

what part of the electromagnetic spectrum to use in order to sense the subject, thus
determining the type of sensor as well as payload weight, size, and power. In many
missions, we may trade off the subject. For example, if we are trying to track a
missile during powered flight, the subject could be the rocket body or exhaust plume,
or both.

For communications and navigation missions the subject is a set of equipment
on the Earth or on another spacecraft, including communication terminals, televisions,
receiving equipment for GPS navigation, or other user-furnished equipment. The key
parameters of this equipment characterize the subject for these types of missions.

12 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 13

The payload consists of the hardware and software that sense or interact with the
subject. Typically, we trade off and combine several sensors and experiments to form
the payload, which largely determines the mission’s cost, complexity, and effective-
ness. The subsystems of the spacecraft bus support the payload by providing orbit and
attitude maintenance, power, command, telemetry and data handling, structure and
rigidity, and temperature control. The payload and spacecraft bus together are called
the spacecraft, space segment, or launch vehicle payload.

The launch system includes the launch facility, launch vehicle and any upper stage
required to place the spacecraft in orbit, as well as interfaces, payload fairing, and
associated ground-support equipment and facilities. The selected launch system
constrains the size, shape, and mass of the spacecraft.

The orbit is the spacecraft’s path or trajectory. Typically, there is a separate initial
parking orbit, transfer orbit, and final mission orbit. There may also be an end-of-life
or disposal orbit. The mission orbit significantly influences every element of the
mission and provides many options for trades in mission architecture.

The communications architecture is the arrangement of components which satisfy
the mission’s communication, command, and control requirements. It depends strong-
ly on the amount and timing requirements of data to be transferred, as well as the num-
ber, location, availability, and communicating ability of the space and ground assets.

The ground system consists of fixed and mobile ground stations around the globe
connected by various data links. They allow us to command and track the spacecraft,
receive and process telemetry and mission data, and distribute the information to the
operators and users.

Mission operations consist of the people, hardware, and software that execute the
mission, the mission operations concept, and attendant policies, procedures, and data
flows. Finally, the command, control, and communications (C3) architecture contains
the spacecraft, communications architecture, ground segment, and mission operations
elements.

1.3 Step 1: Definition of Mission Objectives

The first step in analyzing and designing a space mission is to define mission
objectives: the broad goals which the system must achieve to be productive. Figure 1-4
shows sample objectives for FireSat. We draw these qualitative mission objectives
largely from the mission statement. In contrast, the mission requirements and
constraints discussed in Sec. 1.4 are quantitative expressions of how well we achieve
our objectives—balancing what we want against what the budget will allow. Thus,
whereas we may modify objectives slightly or not at all during concept exploration,
we often trade requirements throughout the process. For FireSat to be FireSat, it must
detect, identify, and monitor forest fires. As we trade and implement elements of the
system during concept exploration, we must ensure that they meet this fundamental
objective. An excellent example of the careful definition of broad mission objectives
for space science missions is given by the National Research Council [1990].

Ordinarily, space missions have several objectives. Some are secondary objectives
which can be met by the defined set of equipment, and some are additional objectives
which may demand more equipment. Nearly all space missions have a hidden agenda
which consists of secondary, typically nontechnical, objectives. Frequently political,
social, or cultural, they are equally real and equally important to satisfy. For example,
a secondary objective for FireSat could be to show the public a visible response to

Primary Objective:

To detect, identify, and monitor forest fires throughout the UnitedStates,
including Alaska and Hawaii, in near real time.

Secondary Objectives:

To demonstrate to the public that positive action is underway to contain
forest fires.

To collect statistical data on the outbreak and growth of forest fires.
To monitor forest fires for other countries.
To collect other forest management data.

performance, the mission objectives are broad statements of what the system must do
to be useful.

frequent forest fires. Third World nations produce satellites in part to show that their
developing technology makes them important players in international politics. Of
course, this secondary political objective for space programs has been important for
many years in both the United States and the former Soviet Union. If we are to meet
all of a space mission’s objectives, we must identify secondary and nontechnical
objectives as well as primary ones.

Multiple objectives also occur when we use a single satellite to meet different
demands. For example, we may use FireSat’s temperature-sensing instruments to
monitor global changes in ocean temperatures. In this case, the secondary objectives
could become as important as the primary ones. A second example would be adding a
communications payload to FireSat to permit better communications among the
distributed groups who fight forest fires. Although the primary objective usually will
be quite stable, secondary objectives may shift to meet the users’ needs and the
redefined potential of the space mission concept.

As in the case of most of the top-level trades, we recommend strongly against
numerical formulas that try to “score” how well a mission meets its objectives. We can
compute probabilities for achieving some technical objectives, but trying to
numerically combine the coverage characteristics of different FireSat constellations
with the political impact of launching FireSat is too simplistic for effective decision
making. Instead, we must identify objectives separately so we can judge how to
balance alternative objectives and mission concepts.

Good mission objectives incorporate user needs and, at least indirectly, the space
characteristics we are exploiting to achieve them. As stated earlier, space is expensive.
If our end objective does not use one of the fundamental space characteristics, it will
likely cost less to do on Earth. For example, there is little reason to manufacture low-
cost consumer goods or publish books in space.

What fundamental characteristics of space make space missions desirable?
Table 1-4 lists some of them with their corresponding missions. Exploring and using
space serves various objectives, from extremely practical telecommunications and
weather, to major scientific observatories hoping to understand the universe better, to
advanced military applications and exploring and exploiting the Moon and planets.
Our objectives are diverse partly because we use many different space characteristics.

14 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 13

For example, materials processing uses the microgravity and high vacuum of space,
disregarding the spacecraft’s position over the Earth. Conversely, communications or
observation satellites emphasize Earth coverage as the most fundamental space
characteristic is achieve their objectives.

Table 1-4 reveals a second important feature: the varying levels of exploitation for
different space characteristics. Many current missions use the global perspective of
space—for telecommunications, weather, navigation, and other aspects of Earth
monitoring. Space-based telecommunications will continue to grow, but it is already
a major and mature industry. Satellite communications by telephone and television
have become a part of everyday life and have helped to bring about a communications
revolution largely responsible for our shrinking world. Equally dramatic changes are
likely in the future as new applications for space-based communications and naviga-
tion continue to emerge.

In contrast to telecommunications, materials processing and precision manu-
facturing in gravity-free space is only in its infancy. Major strides appear possible in
pharmaceutical and semiconductor devices that may bring about an entirely new
industrial segment. Exploiting space’s almost limitless resources is even further
removed. Unlimited continuous power and huge, accessible supplies of physical
materials may, in the long run, maintain an industrialized society without destroying
the Earth’s fragile environment. These objectives will require greater vision than
those for the more fully developed areas of communications, resource mapping, and
monitoring.

We see from Table 1-4 that we have either not used or only begun to use most of
the major characteristics of space, so changes in future space exploration should be far

larger than present development. To take practical advantage of these characteristics,
we must greatly reduce the costs of exploring and exploiting space. Finding ways to
lower these costs is a principal objective of this book. (See Wertz and Larson [1996].)

1.4 Step 2: Preliminary Estimate of Mission Needs,
Requirements, and Constraints

Having defined the broad objectives that the space mission is to achieve, we wish
to transform them into preliminary sets of numerical requirements and constraints on
the space mission’s performance and operation. These requirements and constraints
will largely establish the operational concepts that will meet our objectives. Thus, we
must develop requirements which truly reflect the mission objectives and be willing to
trade them as we more clearly define the space system.

To transform mission objectives into requirements, we must look at three broad
areas:

¢ Functional Requirements, which define how well the system must perform to
meet its objectives.

* Operational Requirements, which determine how the system operates and how
users interact with it to achieve its broad objectives.

* Constraints, which limit cost, schedule, and implementation techniques
available to the system designer.

The needs, requirements, and constraints for any specific mission will depend upon
the mission itself and how we implement it. For example, the mission may be a
commercial venture, a government scientific program, or a crash emergency program
responding to dire need. Still, most space missions develop their requirements accord-
ing to the basic characteristics in Table 1-5.

Establishing top-level mission requirements is extremely difficult, depending on
mission needs and on the perceived complexity or cost of meeting them. Therefore,
contrary to frequent practice, we should iterate the numerical requirements many times
in the design process. The first estimate of mission requirements must come from the
goals and objectives combined with some view of what is feasible. Often, we can
reiterate or slightly modify requirements and specifications from previous missions,
thus carrying over information known from those missions. Of course, we must be
prepared to trade these requirements as we develop the mission concept, thereby
avoiding the problem of keeping old and inappropriate requirements.

The next step in setting up preliminary mission requirements is to look for the
“hidden agenda” discussed in Sec. 1.3 and Chap. 2. This agenda contains the devel-
oper’s implicit goals and constraints. For example, the FireSat mission may need to be
perceived as responding quickly to public demand. Thus, an extended R&D program
to develop the most appropriate FireSat satellite may not be acceptable.

As discussed further in Chap. 21, we must recognize that developing a space
mission depends on political, legal, and economic elements, as well as technology.
Thus, the most appropriate solution must meet mission technical requirements and the
developer’s political and economic goals. For example, satellite systems for a small
nation may use components built in that nation or develop some new components
locally, even though they would cost less if bought in other countries. In this case, we
would spend more money to meet a political constraint: using the space mission to

develop and promote national engineering resources. The technical community often
sets aside nontechnical considerations and regards them as less important or less real
than technical constraints. But a successful mission design must include all require-
ments and constraints placed on the system.

1.4 Step 2: Preliminary Estimate of Mission Needs, Requirements, and Constraints 17

Finally, we reiterate that preliminary mission requirements should be established
subject to later trades. Mission designers often simply try to meet the procuring
group’s requirements and constraints, because not meeting them appears to be a strong
competitive disadvantage. Consequently, designers may not modify them, even if
changes could make the system cost less or perform better for a given cost. Section 3.3
and Chap. 4 detail this process of trading on system requirements to maximize per-
formance vs. cost.

As an example, we consider the requirement for mission duration or spacecraft
lifetime, which may or may not be the same. This parameter exemplifies the difficulty
of establishing requirements. The length of the mission is often indefinite. We want to
detect, identify, and monitor forest fires continuously at a reasonable cost per year. In
practice, however, we must develop a system that meets this need and then deploy it
with an established design life and, perhaps, a replenishment philosophy. The design
life of the individual FireSat spacecraft will strongly affect cost and will determine the
level of redundancy, propellant budgets, and other key system parameters. In princi-
ple, we would like to obtain a graph of spacecraft cost vs. design life as shown in Fig.
1-5. We could then easily compute the total expected cost per year for different design
lives, as shown by the dashed line, and the minimum spacecraft cost per year. We
could also assess technological obsolescence, or the point at which we wish to replace
the spacecraft because of better or cheaper technology.

Fig. 1-5. Hypothetical Curve of Cost vs. Spacecraft Design Life. The cost per year is the
total cost divided by the design life. In principle, we should use such curves to set the
Spacecraft Design Life requirement. In practice, they rarely exist. See Sec. 20.5 fora
Cost vs. Design Life curve for FireSat.

In practice, figures such as 1-5 are almost never done or, at best, are done
qualitatively. The mission duration is normally assigned rather arbitrarily with a
general perception of cost per year. Thus, there may be a push to produce spacecraft
lasting 5 or 10 years because people believe these will be more economical than ones
lasting only a few years. No matter how we choose the design life, we would like to
go through the process described above for decisions about mission lifetime. If at all

18 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process

possible, it would be desirable to create a chart similar to Fig. 1-5 based on even crude
estimates of spacecraft cost. Doing so provides a much stronger basis for establish-
ing mission requirements and, e.g., determining whether we should push harder for a
longer spacecraft lifetime or back off on this requirement to reduce spacecraft
cost.

Having made a preliminary estimate of mission requirements and constraints, we
proceed in Chap. 2 to define and characterize one or more baseline mission concepts.
The issue of refining requirements and assessing how well objectives can be met is
discussed in Chaps. 3 and 4.
