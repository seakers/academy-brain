Cost is an engineering parameter that varies with physical parameters,
technology, and management methods. A system’s cost depends on its size, com-
plexity, technological innovation, design life, schedule, and other characteristics. It’s
also a function of risk tolerance, methods for reducing risk, management style, docu-
mentation requirements, and project-management controls, as well as the size of the
performing organizations. Analyzing and predicting program cost is becoming
increasingly important, often critical, to determining whether a program proceeds. At
the same time, sponsors, responding to budget reductions, and contractors, realizing
that allowing technical performance alone to drive the design usually leads to a more
expensive system, are systematically redefining the business of space, making it more
difficult to accurately predict cost.

These trends dictate a changing role for cost estimation. In traditional, perfor-
mance-only driven programs, cost modeling was primarily used to validate contractor
cost estimates or give funding organizations an independent estimate of probable cost.
Cost estimation was, to some extent, a self-fulfilling prophecy. Often, a space system
would actually cost as much or more than what the budget allowed. However, this role
is giving way to the more complex tasks of design-to-cost and cost as an independent
variable, where performance is maximized subject to cost constraints. This entails a
more proactive and interactive role for the cost estimator with involvement from the

beginning of the process so that we may identify cost-effective solutions that meet a
program’s requirements. We can no longer just apply a general-purpose cost model to
decide which programs to fund. Instead, we must develop a deeper understanding of
cost-modeling methods, programmatic factors, and technological risks. As fiscal pres-
sures continue to drive space budgets lower, cost estimates are being used at virtually
all stages of space system procurement. Early in conceptual design, cost estimates help
us assess whether development will succeed and identify key design decisions that will
influence future costs. Project costs are monitored throughout the development cycle,
and if they move much above budgeted amounts, we often must rescope or even cancel
the program. Cost models must be flexible enough to evolve, from preliminary design
to much later in the integration and test process, when we’ re deciding how to reallocate
limited or diminishing resources.
In this chapter, we will

* Describe how to assess the uncertainty (risk) in the cost estimates

¢ Show how cost and design may be integrated.

20.1 Introduction to Cost Analysis

20.1.1 Elements of Analysis

Figure 20-1 shows the relationships among key elements of cost analysis. The first
step is to develop preliminary cost analysis requirements descriptions which identify
the technical and operational parameters (cost drivers). These become “inputs” to cost
models. We will develop just such a description in this chapter for FireSat. Each alter-
native concept specifies the configuration, number of units, orbits, equipment lists,
hardware and software, and operational staffing needed for costing the system. The
next step in the process is definition of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), an orga-
nizational table used to categorize and normalize costs. The WBS should cover all
phases of the program. For example, the operations period follows Initial Operating
Capability (IOC) and includes software maintenance costs and spare satellites.

Ground rules and assumptions should be laid out at the outset. These assumptions
establish the foundation for understanding the costs and comparing them with those of
other programs. Example assumptions include:

* Costs listed in constant-year dollars (fiscal funding information records costs
in then-year dollars)

¢ Inflation rate forecasts (see Sec. 20.1.4)

¢ Exclusion of contractor fee and costs of the government project office
¢ Inclusion of government-furnished equipment

¢ Learning curve percentage (See Sec. 20.4.4)

Once input parameters have been specified and assumptions delineated, cost
models support the preparation of estimates for each design alternative. The models
combine cost data and cost-estimating relationships as described in Sec. 20.3. The cost
estimates are organized by each segment’s work breakdown structure, life-cycle
phase, and schedule. Estimates prepared with cost models are not “end products”

themselves but, rather, means to an end. That end, typically, is a recommendation for
the most cost effective design or the most affordable approach that meets mission
requirements. Cost and schedule risk analysis is performed to capture uncertainties
inherent in the analysis process and include effects of unusual requirements and
beyond state-of-the-art technology. We distribute costs over the operational period
according to a schedule of events and milestones. This schedule may not be necessary
for early quick-look cost assessments and trade studies, but it is desirable for funding
profile planning. Cost model outputs include:

* The major cost drivers—elements contributing most to total cost or mission
requirements most affecting life-cycle costs

* A cost comparison of alternative systems or subsystems for trade studies

is an important tool for organizing cost information and ensuring consistency in com-
paring alternatives.

Life-Cycle Costs of a space mission architecture (i.e., the total mission cost from
planning through end-of-life) are broken down into three main phases. The Research,
Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) phase includes design, analysis, and test
of breadboards, brassboards, prototypes and qualification units. Commonly referred to
as the nonrecurring phase, RDT&E conventionally includes protoflight units and one-
time ground station costs. This phase does not include technology development for
system components. The Production phase incorporates the cost of producing flight
units and launching them. A definition used to model costs is the Theoretical First
Unit (TFU), which represents the first flight-qualified satellite off the line (for single-
satellite missions the TFU is the flight article). For multiple units, production cost is
estimated using a learning curve factor applied to the TFU cost as discussed in
Sec. 20.4.4. Replacement satellites and launches after the space system final
operating capability (FOC = full complement of on-orbit satellites) has been estab-
lished are not considered as production units. The Operations and Maintenance
(O&M) phase consists of ongoing operations and maintenance costs, including space-
craft unit replacements and software maintenance. Although the space, launch, and
ground segments are usually the most important elements, O&M can sometimes be the
system’s most costly one (especially for constellations and reusable systems). For
Most space programs the primary ongoing operations and support costs are ground
station operations and satellite spares; for reusable systems such as the Shuttle, this
category consists of the ground crew and operations to support them.

20.1 Introduction to Cost Analysis 787

20.1.2 Cost Estimating Methods

The work breakdown structure and system concept provide guidance for determin-
ing which cost methods apply. Three basic methods are used to develop cost estimates:

1. In detailed bottom-up estimating we identify and specify at a low level elements
that make up the system. We then estimate the cost of materials and labor to
develop and produce each element. This method has the advantage of being
explicitly tailored to a specific program and contractor, but its basis of validity is
the credibility of the experts called upon to estimate inputs, such as hours, labor
rates, material costs, and indirect costs. Because this method is time consuming
and because detailed design data is usually not available, this method is least
appropriate for preliminary system studies. Bottom-up estimates are most
commonly used during the production phase of a program, after design details
are well known and a majority of technical uncertainties have been resolved
during development.

2. In analogy-based estimating we use the cost of a similar item and adjust it for
differences in size or complexity. We can apply this method at any level of
detail in the system, but it is lower fidelity than a bottom-up estimate. This
method also presumes that a sufficiently similar item exists and that we have
detailed cost and technical data on which to base our estimate.

3. In parametric estimating we use a series of mathematical relationships that
relate cost to physical, technical, and performance parameters that are known
to strongly influence costs. An equation called the Cost Estimating Relation-
ship, or CER, expresses the cost as a function of parameters. Cost drivers and
function forms are selected based on a combination of engineering judgment
and the statistical quality of the regression results. We may also apply complex-
ity factors to the parameters to account for technology changes.

All three methods have advantages and disadvantages, depending on scope of the
estimating effort and the amount of design and performance information (e.g. relevant
historical data for analogy) available to estimators. Until recently, parametric models
were avoided as the primary tool for developing a proposal bid and used only as back-
up to validate another estimate. That situation is beginning to change, mainly due to
the progress of the Parametrics Estimating Initiative led by several cost-estimating
professional societies and endorsed by the DoD.*

The primary advantage of parametric models lies in their top-down approach.
System requirements and top-level design specifications are all that are required to
complete a cost estimate with a parametric model. Detailed hardware designs and
development schedules do not have to be drafted to estimate costs of candidate system
architectures. Incorporation of CERs within a system design/cost-engineering tool
allows concept evaluation and technology studies to be conducted. Parametric cost
models are therefore well suited for use in cost/performance trade studies that estimate
how cost varies as a function of system requirements, in developmental planning and
architecture studies, and in specific program assessments of cost vs. capability and

* Due to recent downsizing of estimating staffs in government and industry and general matur-
ing of the parametric estimating process, the DoD has publicly advocated application of
parametric estimating models as the preferred method of proposal estimating. See the DoD
[1998] for guidance and examples.

individual parameter sensitivity. Since parameteric cost models are the most appropri-
ate for trade studies, they are the focus of the remainder of this chapter.

Use of a parametric model implies several assumptions. First, because parametric
models characterize historical cost trends as mathematical relationships, it is assumed
that future costs will reflect these historical trends to some degree. Parametric models
are applicable only to the range of historical data. In cases when major technology
advancements are expected, or when fundamental paradigms in system architecture
are shifted, parametric cost models based on old systems may very well not apply. One
example of this problem is encountered when large-satellite-based cost models are
used to estimate costs of today’s smallsats. Such a paradigm shift, and perhaps a tech-
nology shift, requires a specialized model. Lacking new technology factors, CERs
must be adjusted when applied to systems using beyond state-of-the-art technology.
We derive the CERs from historical data, so their technologies may not reflect the
advances usually considered in futuristic studies.

A second implicit assumption made when using parametric cost models is that
program costs are random variables that cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Many more parameters influence costs than can be incorporated into a set of CERs,
such as skill level of contractor engineers and technicians, occurrence of unforeseen
technical problems, business base of all contractors involved, requirements changes,
and test failures. Parametric cost models use a combination of parameters that explain
historical cost trends while maintaining statistical integrity. Influence of all other vari-
ables manifests itself in estimating error, which is often quantified by using underlying
data to calculate the standard error, SE.

There are three general sources for parametric cost estimating models:

¢ Publicly available special purpose models, such as the Unmanned Space
Vehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the
Communications Payload and Spaceborne Electronics Cost Model (CPCM).
Such models are typically developed by the Federal Government and are
usually available to the general public*. See the references at the end of this
chapter for source information.

* Publicly available general purpose models, offered privately by commercial
organizations such as PRICE Systems and SEER Systems. These general
purpose models typically must be calibrated to the user’s specific products and
processes before they can be used for estimating space hardware and software
components.

¢ Private specific purpose models, usually developed by a single organization
from proprietary information, to estimate company-specific systems and com-
ponents only.

In Sec. 20.3 we present CERs for computing the cost of space systems based on
publicly available models. If these models do not apply to a specific concept, we may
need to derive new relationships. The following section summarizes this process.
Fisher [1970] provides a comprehensive discussion.

* Although we refer primarily to government programs and data, the models may be applied to
commercial programs. The recommended cost models are appropriate for both large and small
missions. (See Sec. 20.3.)

20.1 Introduction to Cost Analysis 789

20.1.3. Cost Model Development

Figure 20-3 shows the procedure for developing a CER that represents how the cost
properties of a system or subsystem vary with characteristic parameters. The first
ingredient in defining a set of CERs is a historical database. Extensive research and
data collection based on actual cost and technical data is needed. It’s important to find
out as much as possible about the origin of the data and the reference for measuring
the characteristic physical parameters. We must also separate the cost elements into
comparable physical subsystems or components, which become the costing elements
we use to establish the entire system cost. Programs either already completed or await-
ing launch within a year should be targeted as opposed to programs that are still in
early stages of development. Most costs in the database should be actual program costs
at completion. In cases where satellites are nearly complete but have not yet been
launched, contractor estimates-at-completion costs may be used.

Fig. 20-3. Deriving CERs from Actuals. The key to a credible CER is an accurate database of
relevant historical information from actual programs.

It is also important to normalize the historical data so it is consistent—correctly
categorized between nonrecurring and recurring costs and in the same constant-year
dollars. Then, we would compensate for economic differences in production quanti-
ties. The design or performance parameters to which costs will be related must be in
the same units. These include programmatic, weight-based, and performance parame-
ters for the satellite in general and each of the major subsystems. We typically exclude
the prime contractor’ s fee but include all other direct, indirect, and general and admin-
istrative costs. Award fees and incentives are usually not included, nor are government
costs (i.e., costs associated with the government procurement agency if one exists).*

After cost data are properly categorized and normalized, the task of CER develop-
ment begins. To allow credible subsystem-level cost analysis of potential missions
without requiring a detailed design we need to relate cost to technical characteristics.
Other factors, named wraps, model nonphysical factors not included in the CER, such
as system engineering, management, and product assurance, as well as the cost of in-
tegrating and testing the space system. Wraps typically account for about 30% of the
development cost for space systems. Choosing cost drivers involves a combination of

* A fee should be added if we want to determine the purchase price. This fee is normally a
negotiated value, but 10% is typical for a cost analysis. In addition, be aware of the need to
include subcontractor fees according to the planned contractor tier arrangements.

790 Cost Modeling 20.1

statistics, engineering judgment, and often, common sense. We would hypothesize a
relationship between costs and the explanatory parameters. For conceptual stud-
ies—the primary focus of this book—we would limit the parameters to one or two per
subsystem.

For space systems, cost drivers would be primarily weight, power, and performance
requirements, the parameters most likely to be available during an advanced system
study. For example, in the derivation of the CER for the electrical power subsystem,
we might consider the following: mass, beginning-of-life power, solar array area, on-
orbit average power, design life, battery capacity, solar cell type, battery type, and
payload power. As another example, if the attitude control subsystem is of interest, we
would examine parameters such as pointing accuracy, knowledge, and required slew
rate. We prefer to use a power law for relationships (see Fig. 20-3) because it allows
for expected nonlinearities, and can be easily accommodated by standard regression
packages. Also, since weight is often a key parameter for cost-estimating relation-
ships, the power function with an exponent of less than one models the expected
diminishing effects of increasing weight on costs. This highlights a danger not to
forget: that all CERs are simplifications of the relationship they are emulating.
Weight-driven CERs, for example, imply that lighter structures cost less. In fact, the
opposite may be true. We need to recognize that when designers deliberately reduce
weight, they may increase complexity, trade away ease of manufacturing an integra-
tion, or use inherently more expensive materials.

When deriving CERs we take note of statistical outliers and follow up to ascertain
whether or not apparent discrepancies are attributable to numerical errors or nontradi-
tional ways of accounting for certain costs. We evaluate the “goodness” of the
relationship by evaluating the costs against their corresponding parameters using
regression software. For further information on statistics and regression techniques,
see, for example, Book and Young [1995]. The regression results in an equation be-
tween cost and the parameter or parameters, as well as statistics that indicate how well
the relationship fits the data. Measures of the goodness of fit include the coefficient of
determination, R2, and the standard error, SE. R2, is dimensionless between 0 and 1.
SE is in units of cost or a percentage of the estimated cost depending on whether an
additive or multiplicative error regression approach is used. A strong correlation is
represented by R2 near | and SE near 0. SE is important in evaluating the uncertainty
in estimates as discussed in Sec. 20.4.

For additional information on space cost model development and space costing,
see, for example, Apgar [1990], DISA [1997], Greenberg and Hertzfeld [1994], and
Hamaker [1989]. For a discussion of cost modeling for low-cost missions see Wertz
and Larson [1996] and Sarsfield [1998].

20.1.4 Types of Dollars

For consistency in referring to costs and to avoid confusion in the review of cost
analysis results, constant-year dollars should be used. For examples in this chapter,
Fiscal Year 2000 dollars (FY00$) are assumed. This simplifies the computations and
interpretation of results, especially in making comparisons of alternatives. If project
funding by year is required, then the costs should be spread first by year in constant
dollars and converted to real or then-year dollars by multiplying each year’s funding
by an appropriate inflation factor. Table 20-1 provides a table of inflation factors for
1980-2020 relative to FY2000 as provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense.

To convert costs from any year to fiscal year 2000 dollars (FY00$), divide by the
inflation factor in the table. To convert from FY00$ to other year dollars multiply by
the factor for that year. For conversion to years other than 2000, we calculate a new
inflation factor as the ratio of the factors for the years of interest.

20.2 The Parametric Cost Estimation Process

Table 20-2 summarizes the procedure to compute parametric cost estimates using
the cost models of this chapter. The information needed about the system design is
shown in Table 20-3 along with values developed previously for the FireSat example.
The steps shown follow the general process of Fig. 20-1. The procedure begins with
developing the WBS and collecting the relevant space system characteristics. The next
four steps develop the primary elements of life-cycle costs, computing the costs for the
space, launch and ground segments, followed by the operations and costs. The CERs
for estimating each cost item are given in Sec. 20.3. CERs are provided at the sub-
system level for RDT&E and TFU costs. They have been adjusted to estimate fiscal
year 2000 (FY00) costs. The TFU is the basis for computing the cost of multiple units
in production as described in Sec. 20.4.4. Factors for program level costs and heritage
are shown in Tables 20-7 and 20-8.

20.2.1 FireSat Cost Element Definitions
We include these items in each of the subsystems to be estimated:

¢ Payload: this includes communication systems and sensors (visible and IR).
Some assumptions were made regarding electronic weights as these parame-
ters were not available from the conceptual design.

* Spacecraft Bus: this is the spacecraft less the payload. Primary cost driver is
mass.

¢ Structure: spacecraft structure items including enclosures, deployable compo-
nents, supporting structure and launch vehicle interface. The spacecraft
structure carries and protects the spacecraft and payload equipment through
launch and deployment. Mass is the key metric that determines cost.

¢ Thermal: structure and devices for the purpose of maintaining all elements of
a satellite system within required temperature limits. Thermal control systems
may be classified as passive or active. An example of a passive system is
paints, coatings and blankets, and a space radiator coupled to heat sources by
conductive paths such as base plates. Active thermal-control subsystems
include pumped-loop systems, heaters controlled by thermostats, mechanical
devices (e.g. louvers) and refrigerators. In general, passive systems cost less
than active systems.

¢ Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS): solar arrays, batteries, harness, and power
management electronics. EPS mass, used in the cost model, is largely
influenced by space radiation, which degrades performance of solar cells over
time (FireSat has a 5-year design life). Choices for off-the-shelf solar-array
cells include silicon or gallium arsenide. Battery choices include NiCd and
NiHb».

Cost Modeling 20.2

Tracking, Telemetry, and Command and Data Handling (TT&C/DH): com-
mand/telemetry electronics, onboard computers, transponders, transmitters,
receivers, data storage, antennas, and associated avionics. Primary cost drivers
of the TT&C/DH subsystem are subsystem mass, frequency of the uplink and
downlink, and data rate. In some cases, this is further divided into TT&C (the
communications system) and C&DH (the spacecraft computer plus other data
storage and handling equipment).

Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS): stabilizes and orients
FireSat during its mission using sensors and actuators. ADCS is tightly
coupled to other subsystems, especially the propulsion subsystem. The prima-
ry drivers are requirements for pointing knowledge, control stability, and
maneuvering (such as slewing or payload repointing). The FireSat mission
requires a 3-axis control system to point in a specific direction to within 0.25
deg; knowledge of spacecraft attitude is 0.10 deg.

Propulsion: Provides thrust for attitude control and orbit correction. FireSat
uses a liquid system for on-orbit attitude correction and maneuvering (Table
7-3). The relevant cost drivers are the propulsion subsystem bus dry mass of
8.4 kg (Table 10-31) and the spacecraft dry mass of 112 kg (Sec. 10.6). If orbit
insertion requires an apogee kick motor, additional costs should be assessed.

Integration, Assembly, and Test (IA&T): labor and material costs (primarily
testing) for integrating spacecraft and payload subsystems into an operational
space vehicle. Does not include costs for integrating components into a
subsystem (these costs are included in the subsystem CERs) or for integrating
the space vehicle with the launch vehicle. The total cost of [A&T for a satellite
includes research/requirements specification, design and scheduling analysis
of IA&T procedures, systems test and evaluation, and test data analysis.

Program Level: contractor costs for systems engineering, program manage-
ment, reliability, planning, requirements flowdown, quality assurance, project
control, data preparation, and other costs which cannot be assigned to individ-
ual hardware or software components. Program management includes efforts
associated with planning and directing prime and subcontractor efforts and
interactions. System engineering includes activities required to ensure that all
satellite subsystems and payloads function properly to achieve system goals
and requirements. Data and report generation is a program-level function that
includes efforts required to produce internal and deliverable documentation.

Ground Support Equipment (GSE): test and support equipment needed for
assembly, development and acceptance testing and integration of satellite
subsystems and satellite to the launch vehicle. This equipment is required to
support the satellite and provide physical, electrical, and data interfaces with
the satellite during IA&T. It is therefore classified as a nonrecurring cost.

Launch and Orbital Operations Support (LOOS): planning and operations
related to launch and orbital checkout of the space system. These costs are
those costs typically incurred by the spacecraft prime contractor involving
prelaunch planning, trajectory analysis, launch site support, launch-vehicle
integration (spacecraft portion), and initial on-orbit operations before owner-
ship of the satellite is turned over to the operational user (typically 30 days).
They are generally categorized as recurring costs.

20.3 Cost Estimating Relationships

This section presents the specific CERs recommended for preliminary mission
analysis and design.

20.3.1 Space Segment Costs

The CERs of Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 may be used to estimate costs in thou-
sands of fiscal year 2000 constant dollars as a function of the specified parameters.
(See Sec. 20.1.4 for conversion to other years.) These CERs are derived from historical
data and, therefore, their validity is limited to a range of parameter values. The tables
present the range of application; to preserve their validity, the equations should not be
used further than 25% beyond the parameter ranges given. The CERs were derived
using different satellite data, statistical frameworks, and error models as noted. Some
CERs provide total subsystem cost while others estimate RDT&E and TFU separately.
Differences between the RDT&E and TFU CER ranges are due to availability of data.
For some subsystems, an alternate CER is presented to accommodate a different cost
driver. Generally, TFU CERs show higher variability.

a good estimate is 25% above and below this data range. CER represents contrac-

The CERs for the payload and spacecraft bus subsystems are primarily based on
parameters available during the concept and mission design phase. The models cover
both the subsystem and system levels with the user choosing the appropriate level. The
models used here are publicly-available, special-purpose models, developed by the
U.S. Air Force and NASA. These CERs were obtained from the Unmanned Space
Vehicle Cost Model, Seventh Edition [SMC, 1994], the Communications Payload and
Spaceborne Electronics Cost Model [MCR Federal, 1997], and a derivative of the
Small Satellite Cost Model [Bearden et al., 1996]. Other models that could be used in
lieu of those given in the tables are given by Burgess, Lao, and Bearden [1995], and
Management Consulting and Research, Inc. [1986].

The primary categories of costs are hardware, software and program level (or wrap-
arounds) used to indicate that the estimates for these functions are based upon percent-
ages of hardware cost. Wraps are costs associated with labor-intensive activities where
a level of manpower is allocated over some period of performance. The functions in
this category are management, systems engineering, product assurance, and system
tests. The CERs of Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 provide the overall program level costs
and Table 20-7 provides an allocation of program level costs to the wrap components.

Recurring and Nonrecurring Factors

Nonrecurring costs include all efforts associated with design, drafting, engineering
unit IA&T, ground support equipment, and a portion of program management and sys-
tem engineering costs. This includes all costs associated with design verification and
interface requirements (e.g. drawings, schematics, mockups, boilerplates, breadboards
and brassboards). Recurring costs cover all efforts associated with flight hardware
manufacture, IA&T, and a portion of program management and system engineering
costs. The CERs in Tables 20-4 and 20-5 are already separated between RDT&E (non-
recurring) and TFU (recurring) costs. Since the CERs in Table 20-6 provide estimates
of total subsystem cost, factors for the split between RDT&E and TFU are needed. To
meet this need, we present a list of recurring and nonrecurring factors in Table 20-9.
These factors can be applied to estimated total subsystem costs from CERs to obtain
estimates of the recurring and nonrecurring portions. Total production costs for all
flight units are computed by multiplying the TFU cost by the learning curve factor L
described in Sec. 20.4.4.

Prototype vs. Protoflight Approach

A protoflight approach is one in which the qualification test unit is refurbished for
flight. The CERs in Table 20-4 assume a prototype approach, i.e., include the cost of
one qualification unit. The small-satellite CERs in Table 20-6 assume a protoflight
approach. The protoflight approach saves on costs since no “dead end” hardware will
result. For refurbishment of the qualification unit to become the protoflight unit, 30%
of the TFU should be added to the RDT&E cost. The RDT&E estimate will then
include the first flight article.

Heritage Factors

Table 20-8 presents factors for development heritage. These are multiplicative fac-
tors to be applied to the RDT&E CER for design maturity of a given subsystem. The
difficulty in incorporating heritage information in cost estimation has been, and con-
tinues to be, the quantification of heritage; part of this problem stems from a lack of a

standard definition for heritage. We define heritage as the percentage of a subsystem
that is identical to one or more previous spacecraft, by mass. This has the appeal of
being a measurable quantity, but has some obvious drawbacks. For instance, while
mass may be a reasonable measure of design heritage for structures, it may not be
appropriate for the TT&C subsystem. With this in mind, heritage is a value, from 0%
(no heritage) to 100% (all heritage), which varies by subsystem and is best evaluated
by subsystem design experts. For example, if the subsystem represents an existing
design with 70% heritage, the developments costs will primarily be engineering inter-
face and drawing modifications so that only 30% of the RDT&E cost is needed.

Commercial Missions

The CERs presented here were derived primarily from government procurements.
We should apply a RDT&E factor of 0.8 when the CERs are used to estimate commer-
cial satellite costs. This is an average factor based upon comparison of commercial
communication satellites with government-procured communication satellites. Smith,
Stucker and Simmons [1985] have performed a comprehensive study that indicates a
19% cost growth for military satellite contracts compared to 2% for commercial. The
rationale for the difference is the higher level of uncertainty in mission requirements
as more changes typically occur on the military programs. However, their findings
indicate little difference in unit recurring costs.

Table 20-10 presents software costing relationships for flight and ground software.
It also provides factors for various programming languages. Section 16.3.3 discusses
software development costs further. Flight software is assumed to cost more (per
KLOC) because there is more testing required to meet mission criticality. If software
reuse is employed, the heritage factors in Table 20-8 apply.

20.3.3 Ground Segment and Operations Costs

Ground segment costs vary significantly depending upon the purposes of the
ground stations. For most ground station cost estimates, we must state requirements
for square footage of facilities, and an equipment list of specific items (computers, RF
equipment, and so forth) which are typically not determined during the concept devel-
opment stage of a program.

For this model, the costs for various elements of a ground station will be based
upon typical distribution of costs between software, equipment, facilities and wraps,
as Table 20-11 indicates. The distribution is fairly representative of a number of
space projects. For preliminary mission design, this may be translated into estimated
costs as follows. First, compute the software costs from Table 20-10. Then estimate
other ground segment costs as a percent of software costs using the representative
distributions of Table 20-11. A column to simplify this calculation has been added
to the table.

The operations and support costs during the operational phase of the ground
segment consist primarily of contractor and government personnel costs as well as
maintenance costs of the equipment, software, and facilities. Table 20-12 presents
expressions for these costs. The labor rates include overhead costs and other typical
expenses associated with personnel. For smaller Earth terminals, Table 20-13 provides
some typical costs of communications equipment for commonly used frequency
bands.

20.3.4 Launch Costs

The launch cost model includes vehicle costs and operations costs at the launch
location (Table 20-14). For most missions, the launch represents a significant
portion of the costs and thus the mission designer must consider concepts that are
constrained by launch mass. For reusable vehicles such as the Space Shuttle,
operations represent the predominant costs. The costs are presented in terms of a unit
launch cost with the exception of the Shuttle, where usage cost is based upon a
formula using either weight or length in the Shuttle bay, whichever results in larger
costs. The chart also indicates the costs/kg of payload to LEO. This indicates the
range of cost and payload size and provides guidance in extrapolating to costs for
new launch vehicles to be competitive.

20.4.1 Cost Modeling Errors and Cost-Risk Analysis

Parametric cost modeling relies on a statistical analysis of past data to project future
costs. Evaluating the statistical uncertainty associated with this projection is called
cost-risk analysis because it represents the probabilistic risk that the program cannot
be completed within a specified cost limit. This limit is usually set as the projected cost
plus a cost margin or management reserve, typically on the order of 20% for major
programs.

The basic tenet of parametric cost modeling is to base estimates of what satellites
will cost next time on what they cost last time. If you’re developing a space system
under exactly the same circumstances as before (the same design, organizations, peo-
ple, technology, requirements, and procedures) you’d expect it to cost the same. But
this scenario never exists. The RDT&E cost models of Sec. 20.3 assume a relatively
new design but proven technology. The more new technology is considered, the more
the risk that added time and effort will be required to complete the development.
Program cost is a nebulous quantity, heavily impacted by technological maturity, pro-
grammatic considerations, “normal” schedule slips, and other unforeseen events. Cost
estimates derived from the CERs should therefore be accompanied by a cost-risk
assessment to estimate potential effects of a level of complexity below or beyond
average.

Cost-Risk Analysis provides an assessment of the ability of projected funding
profile to assure that a program can be completed and meet its stated objectives.
Although technical risks are often one of the biggest cost drivers for space systems,
many cost-engineering processes and models ignore effects of cost risk in the interest
of quick-turnaround estimates. Cost-risk analysis is important because single-point
cost estimates, while meeting the top-level needs of budgetary planners, often do not
meet the needs of those who want to perform more detailed trade-offs between cost
and performance (see Book [1993]). The purpose of cost-risk analysis is threefold:

1. Translate qualitative risk assessments into quantitative cost impacts
2. Assist program managers in managing risk
3. Establish an empirical basis for estimating future programs with confidence

This section describes a method of assessing the uncertainty in cost estimates. This
includes identifying the sources of uncertainty, combining them to arrive at a program
level cost uncertainty, and interpreting the results. Cost-risk analysis views each cost
element as an uncertain quantity that has a probability distribution and attempts to
evaluate technical, programmatic, and schedule risks in quantitative terms. Qualitative
measures of risks are then translated into cost-estimate adjustments. A key to making
quick, consistent, and defensible assessments is reducing subjectivity by making
assumptions about sources and magnitude of cost risk. The major sources of cost
uncertainty we consider here are:

¢ Cost-estimating uncertainty as quantified by the standard error, SE

¢ Cost growth due to unforeseen technical difficulties

Examples of risk drivers include beyond state-of-the-art technology (e.g. cooling,
processing, survivability, power, laser communications), unusual production require-

804 Cost Modeling 20.4

ments (e.g. large quantities, toxic materials), tight schedules (e.g. undeveloped
technology, software development, supplier viability), system integration (e.g. multi-
contractor teams, system testing), and unforeseen events (e.g. launch slip, need for
redesign)

The objective is to quantify the sum of the contribution of these uncertainties to the
overall system or program costs. We will use the most likely estimates (MLE), the sum
obtained from the cost models and derive probability distributions that contain the
impact of technology uncertainty and the uncertainty of the cost estimates. Cost-
estimating uncertainty is quantified by computing the standard error (SE). For
development of space-system hardware, CERs usually have SE between 30% and
50%. Cost-estimating uncertainty is therefore quantified by a distribution that has a
mean (the estimate, C), and a variance (square of the SE). *

Cost risk due to technical difficulties is estimated using the technology readiness
level (TRL), shown in Table 20-15, a NASA classification scheme for the level of
technology development (the inherent development risk). A TRL of 1 or 2 represents
a situation of relatively high risk. TRLs of 3, 4 and 5 represent moderate risks, and 6
through 8 are low-risk categories. Based upon related experience, the suggested cost
uncertainties are also presented in Table 20-15. Thus, a low developmental risk sub-
system would have a one standard deviation uncertainty of less than 10%, about the
most likely estimate.

NASA.

* The terminology here can cause confusion. Cost models use the terms most likely estimate,
MLE, and standard error, SE, because the statistical data in the CERs is not truly Gaussian.
However, using a Gaussian probability distribution is often convenient for analyzing errors.
Consequently, throughout this section we will use MLE from the CERs interchangeably with
the mean or estimated cost, C, and SE interchangeably with the standard deviation, 6, even
though means and standard deviations are applicable only if the statistical data has a Gaussian
distribution.

20.4 Other Topics 805

Other adjustment factors correct for uncertainty in the development status of a
specific technology. The technological risk related to developing a space system
depends on how we use the technology and on its degree of “flight qualification.” If
an item has already flown in space, it’s more likely to work again, so it represents less
risk to the user.

To the technology-based risk, we need to add the contribution of cost estimating
uncertainty in a probabilistic fashion. Since the technology uncertainty and the cost
estimating uncertainties are independent (uncorrelated), these may be combined using
the standard square root of the sum of the squares. (See standard probability texts.) For
example, suppose a subsystem TFU MLE is $5 million. The risk level is moderate with
a 20% standard deviation in uncertainty and the cost estimating standard error is as-
sumed to be 15%. The standard error for the sum of the two sources of uncertainty is
the root sum square

(6,2 + 6,2)! = (0.22 + 0.152)1/2 = 0.25 (20-1)

where o; is the cost standard deviation in technology and o;, is the cost estimating
uncertainty. Thus the uncertainty standard deviation is 25% of the MLE for the sub-
system. The input to the above equation will be obtained from Table 20-15 for the o,
and from Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 for the o,. This provides the uncertainty measure
for a subsystem.

For an entire system, the probability sum is more complex. We cannot simply use
the root sum square since there are correlations between subsystems. That is, interre-
lationships exist between the development of subsystems. To capture these interrela-
tionships requires more advanced methods than will be treated here. An approximation
to computing the system uncertainty measure is:

1. Sum the uncertainty standard deviations for each subsystem. This provides a
system uncertainty assuming perfect correlation among subsystems.

2. Take the root sum square of the subsystem uncertainty standard deviations.
This provides a completely uncorrelated solution.

3. Take the average of the two values in steps (1) and (2). This provides an inter-
mediate solution which is a reasonable approximation for most conceptual
analyses.

An example of this process for FireSat is shown in Table 20-22 in Sec. 20.5.
Fig. 20-4 in that section shows the actual shape of the probability distribution, based
on the assumption of Gaussian statistics. The integrated area under the curve up to a
given cost estimate value X; on the horizontal axis yields the probability, P, that the
actual system cost will lie at or below the Xz estimated value. The curve is given by
the Gaussian distribution:

Xp
P(Xp)= | Feoax, 0<P(Xp)<1
-4 20" +o0
e Co
Fx)= +, | Fenax =1

oo (20-2)
Here, C is the estimated cost and cis the standard deviation of the estimate.

806 Cost Modeling 20.4

The above analysis assumes normal distributions for the uncertainties. This is not
usually the case, but does provide simple analytical solutions. A comprehensive
method using Monte Carlo simulation is treated by Wong and Sheldon [1986] and
Dienemann [1966]. The treatment of cost/reliability relationships (that is, the risk
associated with the failure of flight units) is discussed in Sec. 19.2 and by Gupta and
Altshuler [1989]. A more comprehensive treatment of analytical methods and the
method of moments to address cost risk, as well as Monte Carlo simulation methods
mentioned earlier, are given by Wilder [1978], Abramson and Young [1990], Book
[1993], Burgess and Gobrieal [1996], and Young [1992]. The end product of cost-
risk assessment in this framework is a total spacecraft cost-probability distribution,
from which the mean, standard deviation, percentiles, and other descriptive statistics
can be determined. (See Fig. 20-4 for an example cost estimate probability density
evaluation.)

20.4.2 Time Spreading of Costs

Prior sections have focused upon developing total cost estimates. We now address
how costs will be spread over time. The following analytical cost spreading method
was developed by Wynholds and Skratt [1977] and approximates the experience of
actual programs.

The spreading of the costs to determine funding profiles can be approximated by a
function of the form:

F(S)=A [10 + § (15 — 4S)S - 20)]S? + B[10 +S (6S — 15)]S?
+[1-(A+B)](5 - 45)s4 (20-3)

where F(S) is the fraction of cost consumed in time S, S is the fraction of the total time
elapsed, and A and B are empirical coefficients.

The values for the coefficients A and B depend on the expected loading of costs
over time. For instance, a typical period for RDT&E and two production units is
5 years. The costs are usually heavier during the first 2 years when design, develop-
ment and testing occur. Typically, 60% of the costs will be incurred by the midpoint
of the schedule. The coefficients for various spending splits are:

% Expenditure Coefficients in Eq. (20-3)
at schedule midpoint A B
80 0.96 0.04
60 0.32 0.68
50 0 1.00
40 0 0.68
20 0 0.04

A 60% distribution is suggested for the RDT&E and production of the first several
satellites. If more than two satellites are included, the 60% decreases toward a limit of
50%. A specific example is provided in Sec. 20.5.

Another schedule-related issue that we may address is present value, which is based
upon the consideration of the time value of money. One dollar in 2000 is worth more
than a dollar in 2005, since the 2000 dollar could be invested and earn a return so that
its value in 2005 is more than one dollar (in constant 2000 dollars). This value increase
would occur even without inflation.

20.4 Other Topics 807

To illustrate the present value concept, consider a cost comparison of two projects.
Both projects have satisfied all technical requirements. Project A has a three year
development consisting of funding requirements of $10 million, $5 million, and
$1 million in constant 2000 dollars. Project B has a funding profile of $1 million,
$5 million, and $10 million in 2000 dollars. Thus, the totals are the same for both.
However, the buyer of this project, government or otherwise, will prefer the second
project on an economic basis since it will expend most of the funds in the future rather
than the near term. The buyer of Project B could invest the $9 million excess funds in
the first year and have additional funds at the end of the project. The conventional way
of handling a comparison is to compute the present value for both projects using a
discount rate. The discount rate is the time value of money. The appropriate discount
rate is controversial. If possible, treat the discount rate as a parameter and determine
at what point, if any, there is a crossover in the discount rate where one project would
be preferred over another. A 10% rate is a standard value for study purposes.

The present value, PV, is obtained by multiplying the funding for each year by the
factor:

=> oe
(+a)!

where n is the year of project (relative to the constant dollar year), and dis the discount
rate.
For project A, the present value at a 10% discount rate is

PV, = 10 (1 +0.1)0 + 5/1 +0.1)! + 11 + 0.1)? = 15.4 in $ Millions

(20-4)

For project B, the present value is
PVp= 11 +0.1)9 + 5/1 + 0.1)! + 10/(1 + 0.1) = 13.8 in $ Millions

Thus, project B is less expensive than project A by $1.6 million or roughly 10% in
present value terms.

20.4.3 Rough Order-of-Magnitude Cost Estimates

As concepts are developed, it is helpful to have an estimate of the anticipated costs.
By making “sanity” estimates, we can develop some idea of cost bounds for various
concepts. Table 20-16 gives estimated costs in constant 2000 dollars. These should be
used to give rough order of magnitude costs for missions under consideration.

For example, we can estimate the cost of four communication satellites (TDRS-
class), two in each of two orbit planes with launches from both the Eastern and
Western Test Ranges using two Titan IV/Centaurs. Table 20-16 provides an order-of-
magnitude cost of:

Satellites: 4 x $126M $504 million
and Table 20-14 provides an order of magnitude cost of:
Launches: 2 x $333M $666 million

Total $1,170 million

20.4 Other Topics 809

A rule-of-thumb for satellite development costs is that RDT&E (nonrecurring)
costs are 2 to 3 times the unit costs (for high-tech programs, factors of 5 to 6 are used).
Adding development costs of 2.5 times unit satellite costs brings the total costs to
around $1.5 billion. Such quick computations can also be used as a cross check for
estimates obtained from the cost models of Sec. 20.3.

20.4.4 Learning Curve

Historically, the majority of satellites built and flown have been one-of-a-kind sys-
tems. However with the proliferation of constellations where recurring costs and learn-
ing rates dominate the cost equation, a breakout of developmental and theoretical first
unit costs is necessary.

We can adjust the single-spacecraft CERs to correct for cost reduction from
learning how to do the job better or the effects of changing technological status. CERs
effectively predict costs for developing a prototype or first production unit, often
called the theoretical first unit, but they poorly estimate the cost for even the most
modest production line. The staff who manufactures a second or third similar
spacecraft will learn to do the job better and use economies of scale, which quantifi-
ably improve performance. The learning rate for the space and the aerospace industry
is such that, on average, the Nth unit will cost between 87% and 96% of the previous
unit.

The learning curve is a mathematical technique to account for productivity
improvements as a larger number of units are produced. It includes all cost reductions
between the first production unit and subsequent units. This includes cost reductions
due to economies of scale, set up time, and human learning as the number of units
increase. The total production cost for N units is modeled as:

Production cost = TFU x L (20-5)
where
L =N®
B=1- In((100%) / S)
In2

TFU is the theoretical first unit cost, L is the learning curve factor, and S is the learn-
ing curve slope in percent. This form of the learning curve was chosen because of its
fit to empirical data, based on the theory of T.P. Wright [1936].

The learning curve slope S represents the percentage reduction in cumulative
average cost when the number of production units is doubled. The learning curve slope
S sets the value of B. For example: if S = 95% and the first unit costs $1 million, then
doubling the number to 2 units reduces the average cost of both to 95% of the first unit.
Thus, the two units cost $1.9 million. The second unit cost is $0.9 million. The learn-
ing curve exponent B is 0.926 for S = 95%.

For less than 10 units, we recommend a 95% learning curve slope be applied.
Between 10 and 50 units, a 90% learning curve and 85% for over 50 units is appropri-
ate. These will vary with the application and how the manufacturing and assembly
activities are set up. The cost models presented earlier provide first unit costs so that
total production costs are determined by multiplying TFU costs by the learning curve
factor.

810 Cost Modeling 20.5

The following example table illustrates the impact of a 95% learning curve on unit
costs. The unit or marginal cost is the difference in production cost between N units
and N — 1 units. For example, the cost of the fifth unit is the difference in production
cost between the fourth and fifth units, that is, 4.44 - 3.61 =0.83.

Effect of a 95% Learning Curve

Number Cost (TFU x L) Cost Cost
1 1.00 1.00 1.00

2 1.90 0.95 0.90

3 2.77 0.92 0.87

4 3.61 0.90 0.84

20.5 FireSat Example
John T. Collins, Microcosm, Inc.

We will apply the above cost models to the FireSat example to compute life-cycle
cost estimates for the entire mission. We assume that two satellites are needed initially
and that both are launched into a 150-km orbit by a Pegasus XL launch vehicle. The
WBS consists of the space, launch, and ground segments. The space element consists
of two satellites with infrared sensor payloads. The launch segment is two vehicles.
The ground segment will consist of a single ground control station. All of the neces-
sary data is given in Table 20-3.

To illustrate the use of the CERs in Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6, the cost estimates
will be developed to the spacecraft subsystem level. The weight, beginning of life
power, sensor aperture diameter, and other technical characteristics are the key pa-
rameters for the estimate. The specific values are in Tables 20-17 and 20-18. The
hardware RDT&E cost is based upon the CERs of Table 20-4 and 20-6 (nonrecur-
ring portion) modified by the design status factors listed at the bottom of Table 20-8.
The production costs are the result of the TFU CERs of Table 20-5 and 20-6 (recur-
ring portion) multiplied by a learning curve factor L = 1.9 for two units. The com-
putation of L is described in Sec. 20.4.4. The subsequent or second unit cost is then
the difference between the production cost of two units and the TFU. The results for
the large satellite cost model (based largely on USCM 7.0) indicate the IR payload
contributes most to overall system cost. Thus, the payload sensor should dominate
attempts to reduce cost.

Program-level costs are added based on the CERs in Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6.
Ground support equipment costs are then computed from Tables 20-4 and 20-6 based
on RDT&E and first unit hardware costs. The launch operations and orbital support
costs are obtained from Table 20-5 and 20-6. Finally, the satellite software costs are
based upon Table 20-10 using Ada. This yields a total space segment cost of $549M
using the USCM 7.0 model and $44M using the smallsat model. The large discrepancy
in total space segment cost is due largely to the vast difference in cost between the pay-
load cost estimates for each model. The large satellite cost model yields an estimate of

cost estimates illustrates the difficulty in finding an appropriate cost-estimating rela-
tionship for some classes of spacecraft payloads. For this reason, payload cost estima-
tion is in many cases best achieved by using bottoms-up or analogy-based methods
rather than parametrics. The difference in these numbers is attributable to paramount
differences in the database of programs on which the CERs are based including:
prototype vs. protoflight approach, risk acceptance, operational vs. demonstration

Let us now assess the cost uncertainty in our estimate for the hardware using the
technique of Sec.20.4.1. For the FireSat example, the satellite hardware consists of the

814 Cost Modeling 20.5

spacecraft bus and an IR payload with CERs for the TFU from Table 20-5 and
Table 20-6. The spacecraft bus is assumed to consist of proven technology with a TRL
of 6. Some new component designs are necessary, but the technologies have had
applications where engineering models were successfully tested. The IR payload
requires infusion of new technology and is assigned a TRL of 5. The spacecraft dry
weight (including payload) is 140 kg and the IR payload aperture diameter is 0.26 m.
Using the corresponding CERs from Table 20-5 to compute costs and the risk meth-
odology we arrive at the results in Table 20-22.

IR payload 67.4 5 (= 15%) 10.1

Total 74.8 Step 1: Sum
Step 2: RSS
Step 3: Average

The standard deviation for the system technology is obtained by using Table 20-15.
For example, the $0.74M standard deviation for the spacecraft system technology is
10% of the $7.4M cost. The cost estimate standard deviation is assumed to be 15% and
the combined standard deviation is the root sum square (RSS) of the two components.
Thus, the standard deviation of the total satellite hardware cost ($74.8M) is
$15 million or 20%.

The cost to build two FireSat satellites is $194.5 million (see Table 20-17). Assum-
ing this is spread over 5 years with 60% of the costs to be incurred in 2-1/2 years, then
the coefficients would be A = 0.32 and B = 0.68. Inserting these into the equation for
F (S) (Eq. 20-30], we obtain the distribution in Table 20-23 for satellite recurring
costs.

Figure 20-4 displays cost estimate probability density for spacecraft bus RDT&E,

chapter. All costs are represented for the space and launch segment, except payload
cost (due to the large discrepancy in payload cost estimate between the two models).
The results illustrate the difference between these two models and also, where
estimates derived from these two models are most likely to fall. The small satellite cost
model yields a best estimate of $62,181K and a standard deviation of $6,401K. The

these two extremes. The results of such statistical evaluations can be used to dictate
reserves policy (e.g., “risk” dollars) or to guide technology investment.

20.5.1 FireSat Design Life Study
Using an integrated design-to-cost tool that uses design relationships previously
presented and the small-satellite CERs found in Table 20-6, a trade analysis of design
life was performed. The primary drivers for mass increase as a function of increasing
design life are:
1. The requirement for additional propellant for on-orbit station keeping;
2. Aneed for more capable subsystems, for example the power subsystem where
solar cell and battery degradation requires oversizing the system to meet a
new higher beginning-of-life power requirement; and

3. Full redundancy assumed for 7-year lifetime.

816 Cost Modeling 20.5

We chose mass-based CERs and assume that payload requirements and perfor-
mance parameters such as pointing accuracy, downlink data rate, data storage, and
size remain fixed. The results are shown in tabular form in Table 20-24. Mass-based
CERs are favored over the performance-based CERs.

TABLE 20-24. FireSat Mass, Power and Cost as a Function of Design Life. Data assumes
fixed performance requirements. Redundancy and associated impacts to sub-
system masses, and increased power and propellant requirements drive the

tLaunch mass plus 25% margin exceeds payload capability of Pegasus XL. Two

We include launch mass margin relative to estimated Pegasus performance to orbit,
which is about 290 kg to a 700 km circular orbit at 55 deg inclination. Spacecraft pow-
er estimates, used only as intermediate results, demonstrate required growth in the
power subsystem as a function of lifetime. Our required propellant mass increases as
well. When the margin goes negative we are forced to launch Firesat on the more
capable Athena 1 (costs $18M compared with the $13M Pegasus XL). Operations
costs are not changed from our previous analysis of $6M per year.

20.5 FireSat Example 817

Aggregate cost information along with cost per year is shown in Fig. 20-5. This can
be compared with the notional representation in Fig. 1-5 and we have completed the
requirements to design to cost cycle. Information like that shown in Fig. 20-5 is
extremely useful for demonstrating how cost “pushes back” on requirements. When
we specified a mission life of 5 years, we did not have enough information to know
whether this was the proper choice from a cost-effectiveness standpoint. Now that we
have completed the picture, we can see that (all factors considered) the optimal life-
time for FireSat is between 4 and 6 years where the curve is relatively insensitive to
further changes in design life. This is also about the time when we would expect that
the cost-effectiveness of the IR sensor payload and other components may become an
issue. Even though amortized mission costs are lower, i.e., less dollars per year, there
iS proportionally less value.

Spacecraft Design Life (years)

Fig. 20-5. FireSat Design Life Trade. Compare with Fig. 1-5 in Sec. 1.4. Total cost, the sum of
individual spacecraft cost, launch vehicle cost, and operations cost, is shown as a func-
tion of spacecraft design life. On the right axis we plot cost per year which asymptoti-
cally approaches the yearly operations cost as design life goes to infinity. Optimal
design life is chosen at a point on the cost-per-year curve that is relatively insensitive
to changes in design life and while mission data still remains useful.

This analysis highlights an important role for shorter-lived small satellites over
traditional large satellites. Since more rapid technology infusion may provide
increases in cost-performance, we should be able to take advantage of state-of-the-
art technology available 5-6 years from now, instead of continuing to operate an ob-
solescent system. Therefore, we choose to utilize two FireSat payloads, each with a
5-year lifetime, but expect that the second version of the satellite will have higher
performance per pound than what we designed with today’s technology. We can
launch a satellite every 5 years to assure that we don’t experience an outage or de-
sign in extra mission life (with the mass and cost consequences shown in Fig. 20-5)
if the second satellite is delayed.
