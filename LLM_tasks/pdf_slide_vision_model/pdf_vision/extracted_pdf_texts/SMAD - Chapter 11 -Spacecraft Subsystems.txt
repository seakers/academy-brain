This chapter provides design information for the spacecraft bus subsystems,
emphasizing material most pertinent to the spacecraft engineer. It offers practical
insight into the mission and interface requirements that drive how we configure
spacecraft. We include first-order approximations and describe hardware to show how
each subsystem works and to help estimate the subsystem’s size, weight, power
requirements, and eventual cost. We also reference many chapters of this book to
integrate concepts and subsystems. Chapter 17 discusses the propulsion subsystem,
and Chap. 13 provides much of the communications theory. Chapter 10, Agrawal
[1986], Chetty [1991], and Morgan and Gordon [1989] provide insight to the theory

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control
John S. Eterno, Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation

The attitude determination and control subsystem (ADCS) stabilizes the vehicle
and orients it in desired directions during the mission despite the external disturbance
torques acting on it. This requires that the vehicle determine its attitude, using sensors,
and control it, using actuators. The ADCS often is tightly coupled to other subsystems
on board, especially the propulsion (Chap. 17) and navigation (Sec. 11.7) functions.
Additional information on attitude determination and control can be found in Wertz
[1978, 2001], Kaplan [1976], Agrawal [1986], Hughes [1986], Griffin and French
[1990], Chobotov [1991], and Fortescue and Stark [1992].

We begin by discussing several useful concepts and definitions, including mass
properties, disturbance torques, angular momentum, and reference vectors. The mass
properties of a spacecraft are key in determining the size of control and disturbance
torques. We typically need to know the location of the center of mass or gravity (cg)
as well as the elements of the inertia matrix: the moments and products of inertia about
chosen reference axes. (See Sec. 11.6 for examples of moment of inertia calculations.)
The direction of the principal axes—those axes for which the inertia matrix is diagonal
and the products of inertia are zero—are also of interest. Finally, we need to know how
these properties change with time, as fuel or other consumables are used, or as append-
ages are moved or deployed.

A body in space is subject to small but persistent disturbance torques (e.g.,
10+ N-m) from a variety of sources. These torques are categorized as cyclic, varying
in a sinusoidal manner during an orbit, or secular, accumulating with time, and not
averaging out over an orbit. These torques would quickly reorient the vehicle unless
resisted in some way. An ADCS system resists these torques either passively, by
exploiting inherent inertia or magnetic properties to make the “disturbances” stabil-
izing and their effects tolerable, or actively, by sensing the resulting motion and
applying corrective torques.

Angular momentum plays an important role in space, where torques typically are
small and spacecraft are unconstrained. For a body initially at rest, an external torque
will cause the body to angularly accelerate proportionally to the torque—resulting in
an increasing angular velocity. Conversely, if the body is initially spinning about an
axis perpendicular to the applied torque, then the body spin axis will precess, moving
with a constant angular velocity proportional to the torque. Thus, spinning bodies act
like gyroscopes, inherently resisting disturbance torques in 2 axes by responding with
constant, rather than increasing, angular velocity. This property of spinning bodies,
called gyroscopic stiffness, can be used to reduce the effect of small, cyclic disturbance
torques. This is true whether the entire body spins or just a portion of it, such as a
momentum wheel or spinning rotor.

Conservation of vehicle angular momentum requires that only external torques
change the system net angular momentum. Thus, external disturbances must be
resisted by external control torques (e.g., thrusters or magnetic torquers) or the result-
ing momentum buildup must be stored internally (e.g., by reaction wheels) without
reorienting the vehicle beyond its allowable limits. The momentum buildup due to
secular disturbances ultimately must be reduced by applying compensating external
control torques.

11 Attitude Determination and Control 355

Often, in addition to rejecting disturbances, the ADCS must reorient the vehicle (in
slew maneuvers) to repoint the payload, solar arrays, or antennas. These periodic
repointing requirements may drive the design to larger actuators than would be
required for disturbance rejection alone.

To orient the vehicle correctly, external references must be used to determine the
vehicle’s absolute attitude. These references include the Sun, the Earth’s IR horizon,
the local magnetic field direction, and the stars. In addition, inertial sensors (gyro-
scopes) also can be carried to provide a short-term attitude reference between external
updates. External references (e.g., Sun angles) are usually measured as body-centered
angular distances to a vector. Each such vector measurement provides only two of the
three independent parameters needed to specify the orientation of the spacecraft. This
results in the need for multiple sensor types on board most spacecraft.

Table 11-1 lists the steps for designing an ADCS for spacecraft. The FireSat space-
craft, shown in Fig. 11-1, will be used to illustrate this process. The process must be
iterative, with mission requirements and vehicle mass properties closely related to the
ADCS approach. Also, a rough estimate of disturbance torques (see Chap. 10) is nec-
essary before the type of control is selected (step 2), even though the type of control
will help determine the real disturbance environment (step 3).

11.1.1 Control Modes and Requirements

Tables 11-2 and 11-3 describe typical spacecraft control modes and require-
ments. The ADCS requirements are closely tied to mission needs and other subsystem
characteristics, as shown in Fig. 11-2. These requirements may vary considerably with
mission phase or modes, challenging the designer to develop a single hardware suite
for different objectives.

For many spacecraft, the ADCS must control vehicle attitude during firing of large
liquid or solid rocket motors, which may be used during orbit insertion or for orbit
changes. Large motors create large disturbance torques, which can drive the design to
larger actuators than are needed once on station.

Once the spacecraft is on station, the payload pointing requirements usually
dominate. These may require Earth-relative or inertial attitudes, and fixed or spinning
fields of view. In addition, we must define the need for and frequency of attitude slew
maneuvers. Such maneuvers may be necessary to:

Fig. 11-2. The Impact of Mission Requirements and Other Subsystems on the ADCS
Subsystem. Direction of arrows shows requirements flow from one subsystem to
another.

In most cases, we do not need to rotate the spacecraft quickly. But retargeting time
may be critical for some applications. In either case, slewing mainly influences the
choice and size of actuators. For example, the vehicle’s maximum slew rate deter-
mines the thrusters’ size or the reaction wheel’s maximum torque. High-rate maneu-
vers may require other actuation systems, such as a second set of high-thrust reaction
jets or perhaps control moment gyros.

For FireSat, we assume that the launch vehicle places us in our final orbit, with no
need for ADCS control! during orbit insertion. The normal pointing requirement is
0.1 deg, nadir-oriented. Attitude determination must be autonomous, providing Earth-
relative knowledge better than 0.1 deg (to support the pointing requirement) while the
vehicle is within 30 deg of nadir. In addition to these basic requirements, we will
consider an optional requirement for occasional repointing of the spacecraft to a region
of interest. We want to examine how such a requirement would influence the design,
increasing the complexity and capability of the ADCS. For this option, we will assume
the requirement to repoint the vehicle once every 30 days. It must repoint, or slew, up
to 30 deg in under 10 min, and hold the relative nadir orientation for 90 min.

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 359

11.1.2 Selection of Spacecraft Control Type

Once we have defined the subsystem requirements, we are ready to select a method
of controlling the spacecraft. Table 11-4 lists several different methods of control,
along with typical characteristics of each.

Passive Control Techniques. Gravity-gradient control uses the inertial properties
of a vehicle to keep it pointed toward the Earth. This relies on the fact that an elongated
object in.a gravity field tends to align its longitudinal axis through the Earth’s center.
The torques which cause this alignment decrease with the cube of the orbit radius, and
are symmetric around the nadir vector, thus not influencing the yaw of a spacecraft
around the nadir vector. This tendency is used on simple spacecraft in near-Earth
orbits without yaw orientation requirements, often with deployed booms to achieve the
desired inertias.

360 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1

Frequently, we add dampers to gravity-gradient spacecraft to reduce libration
—small oscillations around the nadir vector caused by disturbances. Gravity-gradient
spacecraft are particularly sensitive to thermal shocks on long deployed booms when
entering or leaving eclipses. They also need a method of ensuring attitude capture with
the correct end of the spacecraft pointed at nadir—the gravity-gradient torques make
either end along the minimum inertia axis equally stable.

In the simplest gravity-gradient spacecraft, only two orientation axes are
controlled. The orientation around the nadir vector is unconstrained. To control this
third axis, a small, constant-speed momentum wheel is sometimes added along the
intended pitch axis (i.e., an axis perpendicular to the nadir and velocity vectors). This
“yaw” wheel is stable when it aligns with the orbit normal, and small energy dissipa-
tion mechanisms on board cause the spacecraft to seek this minimum energy, stable
orientation without active control.

A third type of purely passive control uses permanent magnets on board the
spacecraft to force alignment along the Earth’s magnetic field. This is most effective
in near-equatorial orbits where the field orientation stays almost constant for an Earth-
pointing vehicle.

Spin Control Techniques. Spin stabilization is a passive control technique in
which the entire spacecraft rotates so that its angular momentum vector remains
approximately fixed in inertial space. Spin-stabilized spacecraft (or spinners), employ
the gyroscopic stability discussed earlier to passively resist disturbance torques about
two axes. The spinning motion is stable (in its minimum energy state) if the vehicle is
spinning about the axis having the largest moment of inertia. Energy dissipation mech-
anisms on board, such as fuel slosh and structural damping) will cause any vehicle to
head toward this state if uncontrolled. Thus disk-shaped spinners are passively stable
while pencil-shaped vehicles are not. Spinners can be simple, survive for long periods
without attention, provide a thermally benign environment for components, and
provide a scanning motion for sensors. The principal disadvantages of spin stabiliza-
tion are (1) that the vehicle mass properties must be controlled to ensure the desired
spin direction and stability and (2) that the angular momentum vector requires more
fuel to reorient than a vehicle with no net angular momentum, reducing the usefulness
of this technique for payloads that must be repointed frequently.

It takes extra fuel to reorient a spinner because of the gyroscopic stiffness which
also helps it resist disturbances. In reorienting a spinning body with angular momen-
tum, h, a constant torque, 7, will produce an angular velocity, w, perpendicular to the
applied torque and angular momentum vector, of magnitude w =T/h. Thus, the higher
the stored momentum is, the more torque must be applied for a given @. For a maneu-
ver through an angle 9, the torque-time product—an indication of fuel required for the
maneuver—is a constant equal to 48. Conversely, for a nonspinning vehicle with no
initial angular velocity, a small torque can be used to start it rotating, with an opposite
torque to stop it. The fuel used for any angle maneuver can be infinitesimally small if
a slow maneuver is acceptable.

A useful variation of spin control is called dual-spin stabilization, where the
spacecraft has two sections spinning at different rates about the same axis. Normally,
one section, the rotor, spins rapidly to provide angular momentum, while the second
section, the stator or platform, is despun to keep one axis pointed toward the Earth or
Sun. By combining inertially fixed and rotating sections on the same vehicle, dual
spinners can accommodate a variety of payloads in a simple vehicle. Also, by adding
energy dissipation devices to the platform, a dual spinner can be passively stable

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 361

spinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia. This permits more pencil-
shaped spacecraft, which fit better in launch vehicle fairings. The disadvantage of
dual-spin stabilization is the added complexity of the platform bearing and slip rings
between the sections. This complexity can increase cost and reduce reliability
compared to simple spin stabilization.

Spinning spacecraft, both simple and dual, exhibit several distinct types of motion
which often are confused. Precession is the motion of the angular momentum vector
caused by external torques such as thruster firings. Wobble is the apparent motion of
the body when it is spinning with the angular momentum vector aligned along a
principal axis of inertia which is offset from a body reference axis—for example, the
intended spin axis. This looks like motion of the intended spin axis around the angular
momentum vector at the spin rate.

Nutation is the torque-free motion of the spacecraft body when the angular
momentum vector is not perfectly aligned along a principal axis of inertia. For rod-
shaped objects, this motion is a slow rotation (compared to spin rate) of the spin axis
around the angular momentum vector. For these objects, spinning about a minimum
inertia axis, additional energy dissipation will cause increased nutation. For disk-
shaped objects, spinning around a maximum inertia axis, nutation appears as a higher-
than-spin-rate tumbling. Energy dissipation for these objects (e.g., with a passive
nutation damper) reduces nutation, resulting in a clean spin.

Nutation is caused by disturbances such as thruster impulses, and can be seen as
varying signals in body-mounted inertial and external sensors. Wobble is caused by
imbalance and appears as constant offsets in body-mounted sensors. Such constant
offsets are rarely discernible unless multiple sensors are available.

Spin stability normally requires active control, such as mass expulsion or magnetic
coils, to periodically adjust the spacecraft’s attitude and spin rate to counteract
disturbance torques. In addition, we may need to damp the nutation caused by distur-
bances, precession commands, or fuel slosh. Aggravating this nutation is the effect of
structural flexure and fuel slosh, which is present in any space vehicle to one degree
or another. Once the excitation stops, nutation decreases as these same factors dissi-
pate the energy. But this natural damping can take hours. We can neutralize this source
of error in minutes with nutation dampers (see Sec. 11.1.2). We can also reduce the
amount of nutation from these sources by increasing the spin rate, thus increasing the
stiffness of the spinning vehicle. If the spin rate is 20 rpm, and the nutation angle is
3 deg, then at 60 rpm the nutation angle would decrease by a factor of three. We sel-
dom use spin rates above 90 rpm because of the large centrifugal forces and their effect
on structural design and weight. In thrusting and pointing applications, spin rates
under 20 rpm may allow excessive nutation and are not used. However, noncritical
applications, such as thermal control, are frequently insensitive to nutation and may
employ very low spin rates.

Three-axis Control Techniques. Spacecraft stabilized in 3 axes are more common
today than those using spin or gravity gradient. They maneuver and can be stable and
accurate, depending on their sensors and actuators. But they are also more expensive
and more complex. The control torques about the axes of 3-axis systems come from
combinations of momentum wheels, reaction wheels, control moment gyros, thrusters,
or magnetic torquers. Broadly, however, these systems take two forms: one uses mo-
mentum bias by placing a momentum wheel along the pitch axis; the other is called
zero momentum with a reaction wheel on each axis. Either option usually needs thrust-
ers or magnetic torquers as well as the wheels.

362 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1

In a zero-momentum system, reaction wheels respond to disturbances on the vehi-
cle. For example, a vehicle-pointing error creates a signal which speeds up the wheel,
initially at zero. This torque corrects the vehicle and leaves the wheel spinning at low
speed, until another pointing error speeds the wheel further or slows it down again. If
the disturbance is cyclic during each orbit, the wheel may not approach saturation
speed for several orbits. Secular disturbances, however, cause the wheel to drift toward
saturation. We then must apply an external torque, usually with a thruster or magnetic
torquer, to force the wheel speed back to zero. This process, called desaturation,
momentum unloading, or momentum dumping, can be done automatically or by com-
mand from the ground.

When high torque is required for large vehicles or fast slews, a variation of 3-axis
control is possible using control moment gyros, or CMGs. These devices work like
momentum wheels on gimbals. (See Sec. 11.1.4 for a further discussion of CMGs.)
The control of CMGs is complex, but their available torque for a given weight and
power can make them attractive.

As a final type of zero momentum 3-axis control, simple all-thruster systems are
used for short durations when high torque is needed, such as orbit insertion or during
AV burns from large motors. These thrusters then may be used for different purposes
such as momentum dumping during other mission modes.

Momentum bias systems often have just one wheel with its spin axis mounted along
the pitch axis, normal to the orbit plane. The wheel is run at a nearly constant, high
speed to provide gyroscopic stiffness to the vehicle, just as in spin stabilization, with
similar nutation dynamics. Around the pitch axis, however, the spacecraft can control
attitude by torquing the wheel, slightly increasing or decreasing its speed. Periodically,
the pitch wheel must be desaturated (brought back to its nominal speed), as in zero-
momentum systems, using thrusters or magnets.

The dynamics of nadir-oriented momentum-bias vehicles exhibit a phenomenon
known as roll-yaw coupling. To see this coupling, consider an inertially-fixed angular
momentum vector at some angle with respect to the orbit plane. If the angle is initially
a positive roll error, then 1/4 orbit later it appears purely about the yaw axis as a
negative yaw error. As the vehicle continues around the orbit, the angle goes through
negative roll and positive yaw before realigning as positive roll. This coupling, which
is due to the apparent motion of the Earth and, therefore, the Earth-fixed coordinate
frame as seen from the spacecraft, can be exploited to control roll and yaw over a quar-
ter orbit using only a roll sensor.

Effects of Requirements on Control Type. With the above knowledge of control
types, we can proceed to select a type which best meets mission requirements. Tables
11-5 through 11-7 describe the effects of orbit insertion, payload pointing, and payload
slew requirements on the selection process.

A common control approach during orbit insertion is to use the short-term spin
stability of the spacecraft-orbit-insertion motor combination. Once on station, the
motor may be jettisoned, the spacecraft despun using jets or a yo-yo device, and a
different control technique used.

Payload pointing will influence the ADCS control method, the class of sensors, and
the number and kind of actuation devices. Occasionally, pointing accuracies are so
stringent that a separate, articulated platform is necessary. An articulated platform can
perform scanning operations much easier than the host vehicle, with better accuracy
and stability.

Trade studies on pointing requirements must consider accuracy in determining
attitude and controlling vehicle pointing. We must identify the most stringent require-
ments. Table 11-8 summarizes effects of accuracy requirements on the spacecraft’s
ADCS subsystem approach. Section 5.4 discusses how to develop pointing budgets.

FireSat Control Selection. For FireSat, we consider two options for orbit insertion
control. First, the launch vehicle may directly inject the spacecraft into its mission
orbit. This common option simplifies the spacecraft design, since no special insertion
mode is needed. An alternate approach, useful for small spacecraft such as FireSat, is
to use a monopropellant system on board the spacecraft to fly itself up from a low park-
ing orbit to its final altitude. For small insertion motors, reaction wheel torque or
momentum bias stabilization may be sufficient to control the vehicle during this burn.
For larger motors, AV thruster modulation or dedicated ADCS thrusters become
attractive.

Once on-station, the spacecraft must point its sensors at nadir most of the time and
slightly off-nadir for brief periods. Since the payload needs to be despun and the space-
craft frequently reoriented, spin stabilization is not the best choice. Gravity-gradient
and passive magnetic control cannot meet the 0.1 deg pointing requirement or the
30 deg slews. This leaves 3-axis control and momentum-bias stabilization as viable
options for the on-station control as well.

Depending on other factors, either approach might work, and we will baseline
momentum bias control with its simpler hardware requirements. In this case, we will
use a single pitch wheel for momentum and electromagnets for momentum dumping
and roll and yaw control.

For the optional off-nadir pointing requirement, 3-axis control with reaction wheels
might be more appropriate. Also, 3-axis control often can be exploited to simplify the
solar array design, by using one of the unconstrained payload axes (yaw, in this case)
to replace a solar array drive axis. Thus, the reduced array size possible with 2 deg of
freedom can be achieved with one array axis drive and one spacecraft rotation.

11.1.3 Quantify the Disturbance Environment

In this step, we determine the size of the external torques the ADCS must tolerate.

by solar-radiation, and, for low-altitude orbits, aerodynamic torques. Section 8.1
discusses the Earth environment in detail, and Chap. 10 and Singer [1964] provide a
discussion of disturbances. Tables 11-9A and 11-9B summarize the four major distur-
bances, provide equations to estimate their size for the worst case, and calculate values
for the FireSat example. ,

Disturbances can be affected by the spacecraft orientation, mass properties, and
design symmetry. For the normal FireSat orientation, the largest torque is due to the
residual magnetism in the spacecraft. If, however, we use the optional 30-deg off-nadir
pointing, the gravity-gradient torque increases over an order of magnitude, to become
as large as the magnetic torque. Note that we use 1 deg in the gravity-gradient calcu-
lations, rather than the 0.1 deg pointing accuracy. This is to account for our uncertain
knowledge of the principal axes. If the principal axes are off by several degrees, that
angle may dominate in the disturbance calculations. We also note that a less symmetric
solar array arrangement would have increased both the aerodynamic and solar torques,
making them closer to the magnetic torque in this example.

Aerodynamics For illustration purposes we assume a 3 m? surface, offset from the center
of mass by 0.2 m. In a 700-km orbit the velocity is = 7,504 m/s, the
atmospheric density (0) is ~ 10-13 kg/m. For C,, the drag coefficient,
use 2.0.

T= FL=1.7x 10-5 N (0.2 m)=3.4x 10-8 Nem

This is small. At a 100-km orbit, however, 0 = 10-9 kg/m8. This results in
T= 3.3 x 10-2 Nem, which is significant for our small spacecraft.

* Residual magnetic dipoles can range anywhere from 0.1 to > 20 A-m? depending on the spacecraft's
size and whether any onboard compensation is provided. On a small-sized, uncompensated vehicle,
1 A-mé is typical (1 A-m? = 1,000 pole -cm).

The other disturbances on the control system are internal to the spacecraft. Fortu-
nately, we have some control over them. If we find that one is much larger than the
rest, we can respecify it to tighter values. This change would reduce its significance
but most likely add to its cost or weight. Table 11-10 summarizes the common internal
disturbances. Misalignments in the center of gravity and in thrusters will show up dur-
ing thrusting only and are corrected in a closed-loop control system. The slosh and
operating machinery torques are of greater concern but depend on specific hardware.
If a spacecraft component has fluid tanks or rotating machinery, the system designer
should investigate disturbance effects and ways to compensate for the disturbance, if
required. Standard techniques include slosh baffles or counter-rotating elements.

11.1.4 Select and Size ADCS Hardware

We are now ready to evaluate and select the individual ADCS components.

Actuators. We first discuss the actuators, as summarized in Table 11-11, beginning
with reaction and momentum wheels. Reaction wheels are essentially torque motors
with high-inertia rotors. They can spin in either direction, and provide one axis of con-
trol for each wheel. Momentum wheels are reaction wheels with a nominal spin rate
above zero to provide a nearly constant angular momentum. This momentum provides
gyroscopic stiffness to two axes, while the motor torque may be controlled to precisely
point around the third axis.

In sizing wheels, it is important to distinguish between cyclic and secular distur-
bances, and between angular momentum storage and torque authority. For 3-axis
control systems, cyclic torques build up cyclic angular momentum in reaction wheels,
as the wheels provide compensating torques to keep the vehicle from moving. We
typically size the angular momentum capacity of a reaction wheel (limited by its
saturation speed) to handle the cyclic storage during an orbit without the need for fre-
quent momentum dumping. Thus, the average disturbance torque for 1/4 or 1/2 orbit
determines the minimum storage capability. The secular torques and our total storage
capacity then define how frequently angular momentum must be dumped.

The torque capability of the wheels usually is determined by slew requirements or
the need for control authority above the peak disturbance torque in order for the wheels
to maintain pointing accuracy.

For 3-axis control, at least three wheels are required with their spin axes not
coplanar. Often, a fourth redundant wheel is carried in case one of the three primaries

fails. If the wheels are not orthogonal (and the redundant one never is), additional
torque and momentum authority may be necessary to compensate for the unfavorable
geometry. It is also common to use wheels larger than the minimum required in order
to use a standard component.

For spin-stabilized or momentum-bias systems, the cyclic torques will cause cyclic
rates, while the secular torques cause gradual divergence. We typically design the
stored angular momentum, determined by spin rate and inertia of the spinning body,
to be large enough to keep the cyclic motion within our pointing specification without
active control during an orbit. Periodic torquing will still be required to counteract the
secular disturbances. The more angular momentum in the body, the more resistant it
is to external torques. An upper limit on the stored momentum, if one exists, may be
defined by the fuel cost to precess this angular momentum.

For high-torque applications, control-moment gyros may be used instead of reac-
tion wheels. These are single- or double-gimbaled wheels spinning at constant speed.
By turning the gimbal axis, we can obtain a high-output torque whose size depends on
the speed of the rotor and the gimbal rate of rofation. Control systems with control
moment gyros can produce large torques about all three of the spacecraft’s orthogonal
axes, SO we most often use them for agile (high-rate) maneuvers. They require a com-
plex control law and momentum exchange for desaturation. Other disadvantages are
high cost and weight.

Spacecraft also use magnetic torquers as actuation devices. These torquers use
magnetic coils or electromagnets to generate magnetic dipole moments. Magnetic
torquers can compensate for the spacecraft’s residual magnetic fields or attitude drift
from minor disturbance torques. They also can desaturate momentum-exchange sys-
tems but usually require much more time than thrusters. A magnetic torquer produces
torque proportional (and perpendicular) to the Earth’s varying magnetic field. Electro-
magnets have the advantage of no moving parts, requiring only a magnetometer for
field sensing and a wire-wound, electromagnetic rod in each axis. Because they use
the Earth’s natural magnetic fields, they are less effective at higher orbits. We can
easily specify the rod’s field strength in amp-turn-m2 and tailor it to any application.
Table 11-12 describes sizing rules of thumb for wheels and magnetic torquers.

Note: For actuator sizing, the magnitude and direction of the disturbance torques must be considered. In particular,
momentum accumulation in inertial coordinates must be mapped to body-fixed wheel axes, where necessary.

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 371

Gas jets or thrusters produce torque by expelling mass, and are not governed by the
same concerns as momentum storage devices. We consider them to be a hot-gas
system, either bipropellant or monopropellant, when a chemical reaction produces the
energy. They are a cold-gas system when energy comes from the latent heat of a phase
change or from the work of compression without a phase change. Cold-gas systems
usually apply to small spacecraft and low-impulse requirements.

Thrusters produce torques and forces that:

¢ Control attitude ¢ Adjust orbits

¢ Control nutation ¢ Control the spin rate

* Maneuver spacecraft ¢ Dump extra momentum from a momentum
over large angles wheel, reaction wheel, or control moment gyro

Unfortunately, their plumes may impinge on the spacecraft, contaminating surfaces,
and they require expendable propellant, dictating spacecraft life. An advantage is that
they can provide large, instantaneous torques at any point in the orbit.

We must decide whether we need thrusters, how many we need, and where to locate
them. For applications that demand fine control from the thrusters, we may have to
specify the minimum impulse from a single thruster pulse—usually 20 ms or greater.
Single thrust levels are usually used, unless the complication of dual or variable thrust
is required.

Although the baseline FireSat spacecraft will use magnetic torquers, we illustrate
the thruster sizing calculations for momentum dumping and the optional slew require-
ment. We will assume the thruster’s moment arm is 0.5 m. Table 11-13 gives proce-
dures and simplified equations, where applicable, for sizing thrusters and estimating
propellant. Refer to Chap. 17 for a thorough discussion of propulsion subsystems.

The size of the thrusters and required propellent are small for this example. For the
optional system with reaction wheels, slewing can be accomplished with the wheels,
avoiding use of propellent. For the baseline momentum bias system, we would use
thrusters for the optional slews, though large electromagnets could be used if thrusters
were not available and maneuver time were not important.

Sensors. We complete this hardware unit by selecting the sensors needed for
control. Consult Table 11-14 for a summary of typical devices, as well as their perfor-
mance and physical characteristics. Note, however, that sensor technology is evolving
rapidly, promising more accurate, lighter-weight sensors for future mission.

Sun sensors are visible-light detectors which measure one or two angles between
their mounting base and incident sunlight. They are popular, accurate and reliable, but
require clear fields of view. They can be used as part of the normal attitude determi-
nation system, part of the initial acquisition or failure recovery system, or part of an
independent solar array orientation system. Since most low-Earth orbits include
eclipse periods, Sun-sensor-based attitude determination systems must provide some
way of tolerating the regular loss of this data without violating pointing constraints.

Sun sensors can be quite accurate (< 0.01 deg) but it is not always possible to take
advantage of that feature. We usually mount Sun sensors near the ends of the vehicle
to obtain an unobstructed field of view. Sun sensor accuracy can be limited by struc-
tural bending on large spacecraft. Spinning satellites use specially designed Sun sen-
sors that measure the angle of the Sun with respect to the spin axis of the vehicle. The
data may be sent to the ground for processing or used in a closed-loop control system
on board the vehicle.

Star sensors have evolved rapidly in the past few years, and represent the most
common sensor for high-accuracy missions. Star sensors can be scanners or trackers.
Scanners are used on spinning spacecraft. Stars pass through multiple slits in a scan-

ner’s field of view. After several star crossings, we can derive the vehicle’s attitude.
We use trackers on 3-axis attitude stabilized spacecraft to track one or more stars to
derive 2- or 3-axis attitude information. The most sophisticated units not only track the
stars as bright spots, but identify which star pattern they are viewing, and output the
sensor’s orientation compared to an inertial reference. Putting this software inside the
sensor simplifies processing requirements of the remaining attitude control software.

While star sensors excel in accuracy, care is required in their specfication and use.
For example, the vehicle must be stabilized to some extent before the trackers can
determine where they point. This stabilization may require alternate sensors, which
can increase total system cost. Also, star sensors are susceptible to being blinded by
the Sun, Moon, or even planets, which must be accommodated in their application.
Where the mission requires the highest accuracy and justifies a high cost, we use a
combination of star trackers and gyros. These two sensors complement each other
nicely: the gyros can be used for initial stabilization, and during periods of sun or
moon interference in the trackers, while the trackers can be used to provide a high-
accuracy, low frequency, external reference unavailable to the gyros. Work continues
to improve the sample rate of star trackers and to reduce their radiation sensitivity.

Horizon sensors are infrared devices that detect the contrast between the cold of
deep space and the heat of the Earth’s atmosphere (about 40 km above the surface in
the sensed band). Simple narrow field-of-view fixed-head types (called pippers or
horizon crossing indicators) are used on spinning spacecraft to measure Earth phase
and chord angles which, together with orbit and mounting geometry, define two angles
to the Earth (nadir) vector. Scanning horizon sensors use a rotating mirror or lens to
replace (or augment) the spinning spacecraft body. They are often used in pairs for
improved performance and redundancy. Some nadir-pointing spacecraft use staring
sensors which view the entire Earth disk (from GEO) or a portion of the limb (from
LEO). The sensor fields of view stay fixed with respect to the spacecraft. This type
works best for circular orbits.

Horizon sensors provide Earth-relative information directly for Earth-pointing
spacecraft, which may simplify onboard processing. The scanning types require clear
fields of view for their scan cones (typically 45, 60, or 90 deg, half-angle). Typical
accuracies for systems using horizon sensors are 0.1 to 0.25 deg, with some applica-
tions approaching 0.03 deg. For the highest accuracy in low-Earth orbit, it is necessary
to correct the data for Earth oblateness and seasonal horizon variations.

Magnetometers are simple, reliable, lightweight sensors that measure both the
direction and size of the Earth’s magnetic field. When compared to the Earth’s known
field, their output helps us establish the spacecraft’s attitude. But their accuracy is not
as good as that of star or horizon references. The Earth’s field can shift with time and
is not known precisely in the first place. To improve accuracy, we often combine their
data with data from Sun or horizon sensors. When a vehicle using magnetic torquers
passes through magnetic-field reversals during each orbit, we use a magnetometer to
control the polarity of the torquer output. The torquers usually must be turned off while
the magnetometer is sampled to avoid corrupting the measurement.

GPS receivers are commonly known as high-accuracy navigation devices. Recently,
GPS receivers have been used for attitude determination by employing the differential
signals from separate antennas on a spacecraft. Such sensors offer the promise of low
cost and weight for LEO missions, and are being used in low accuracy applications or
as back-up sensors. Development continues to improve their accuracy, which is
limited by the separation of the antennas, the ability to resolve small phase differences,

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 375

the relatively long wavelength, and multipath effects due to reflections off spacecraft
components.

Gyroscopes are inertial sensors which measure the speed or angle of rotation from
an initial reference, but without any knowledge of an external, absolute reference. We
use them in spacecraft for precision attitude sensing when combined with external
references such as star or sun sensors, or, for brief periods, for nutation damping or
attitude control during thruster firing. Manufacturers use a variety of physical
phenomena, from simple spinning wheels (iron gyros using ball or gas bearings) to
ring lasers, hemispherical resonating surfaces, and laser fiber optic bundles. The gyro
manufacturers, driven by aircraft markets, steadily improve accuracy while reducing
size and mass.

Error models for gyroscopes vary with the technology, but characterize the deteri-
oration of attitude knowledge with time (degrees per hour or per square-root of time).
When used with an accurate external reference, such as star trackers, gyros can provide
smoothing (filling in the measurement gaps between star tracker samples) and higher
frequency information (tens to hundreds of hertz), while the star trackers provide the
low frequency, absolute orientation information that the gyros lack. Individual gyros
provide one or two axes of information, and are often grouped together as an Inertial
Reference Unit, TRU, for three full axes. IRUs with accelerometers added for posi-
tion/velocity sensing are called Inertial Measurement Units, IMUs.

Sensor selection. Sensor selection is most directly influenced by the required
orientation of the spacecraft (e.g., Earth- or inertial-pointing) and its accuracy. Other
influences include redundancy, fault tolerance, field of view requirements, and avail-
able data rates. Typically, we identify candidate sensor suites and conduct a trade
study to determine the best, most cost-effective approach. In such studies, the exist-
ence of off-the-shelf components and software can strongly influence the outcome. In
this section we will only briefly describe some selection guidelines.

Full 3-axis knowledge requires at least two external vector measurements, although
we use inertial platforms or spacecraft angular momentum (from spinning or momen-
tum wheels) to hold the attitude between external measurements. In some cases, if
attitude knowledge can be held for a fraction of an orbit, the external vectors (e.g.,
Earth or magnetic) will have moved enough to provide the necessary information.

For Earth-pointed spacecraft, horizon sensors provide a direct measurement of
pitch and roll axes, but require augmentation for yaw measurements. Depending on the
accuracy required, we use Sun sensors, magnetometers, or momentum-bias control
relying on roll-yaw coupling for the third degree of freedom. For inertially-pointing
spacecraft, star and Sun sensors provide the most direct measurements, and inertial
platforms are ideally suited. Frequently, only one measurement is made in the ideal
coordinate frame (Earth or inertial), and the spacecraft orbit parameters are required
in order to convert a second measurement or as an input to a magnetic field model. The
parameters are usually uplinked to the spacecraft from ground tracking, but autono-
mous navigation systems using GPS are also in use (see Sec. 11.7).

FireSat sensors. The external sensors for FireSat could consist of any of the types
identified. For the 0.1 deg Earth-relative pointing requirement, however, horizon sen-
sors are the most obvious choice since they directly measure two axes we need to
control. The accuracy requirement makes a star sensor a strong candidate as well,
although its information needs to be transformed to Earth-relative pointing for our use.
The 0.1 deg accuracy is at the low end of horizon sensors’ typical performance, and
we need to be careful to get the most out of their data.

We assume we also need a yaw sensor capable of 0.1 deg, and this choice is less
obvious. (Often, it is useful to question a tight yaw requirement. Many payloads, e.g.,
antennas, some cameras, radars, are not sensitive to rotations around their pointing
axis. For this discussion, we will assume the requirement is firm.) We could use sun
sensors, but their data needs to be replaced during eclipses. Magnetometers don’t have
the necessary accuracy on their own, but with our momentum-bias system, roll-yaw
coupling, and some yaw filtering, a magnetometer-Sun sensor system should work.

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 377

At this point, we consider the value of an inertial reference package. Such packages,
although heavy and expensive, provide a short-term attitude reference which would
permit the Earth vector data to be used for full 3-axis knowledge over an orbit. A gyro
package would also reduce the single-measurement accuracy required of the horizon
sensors, simplifying their selection and processing. Such packages are also useful in
the control system if fast slews are required. Although nice to have, an inertial package
does not seem warranted for FireSat. Table 11-15 summarizes our hardware selections.

Once the hardware selection is complete, it must be documented for use by other
system and subsystem designers as follows:

¢ Specify the power levels and weights for each assembly

Establish the electrical interface to the outside world

¢ Describe requirements for mounting, alignment, heating, or coding

¢ Determine what telemetry data we must process

¢ Document how much software we need to support equations of motion

Specific numbers depend on the vendors selected. A typical list for FireSat might look
like Table 11-16, but the numbers could vary considerably with only slight changes in
subsystem accuracies or slewing requirements.

11.1.5 Define the Control Algorithms

Finally, we must tie all of the control components together into a cohesive system.
We begin with a block diagram for a single-axis control system (See Fig. 11-3). As we
refine the design, we add or modify feedback loops for rate and altitude data, define
gains and constants, and fine tune the equations of motion. To do so, we need good
mathematical simulations of the entire system, including internal and external distur-
bances. Usually, linear differential equations with constant coefficients describe the
dynamics of a control system, thus allowing us to analyze its performance with the
highly developed tools of linear servomechanism theory. With these same tools, we
can easily do linear compensation to satisfy specifications for performance.

Fig. 11-3. Diagram of a Typical Attitude Control System with Control Along a Single Axis.
Control algorithms are usually implemented in an onboard processor and analyzed
with detailed simulations.

We typically apply linear theory only to preliminary analysis and design. As the
design matures, nonlinear effects come strongly into play. These effects may be
inherent or intentionally introduced to improve the system’s performance. Feedback
control systems are of two kinds, based on the flow of their control signals. They are
continuous-data systems when their control signals flow continuously without inter-
ruption; they are sampled-data systems when sampling occurs at equal intervals. Most
modern spacecraft process data through digital computers and therefore use control
systems that sample data.

Although it is beyond the scope of this handbook to provide detailed design
guidance on feedback control systems, the system designer should recognize the inter-
acting effects of attitude control system loop gain, capability of the attitude control
system to compensate for disturbances, accuracy of attitude control, and control
system bandwidth.

11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 379

Three-axis stabilization. Different types of active control systems have different
key parameters and algorithms. Frequently, 3-axis control can be decoupled into three
independent axes. The most basic design parameter in each axis is its position gain,
Kp. This is the amount of control torque which results from a unit attitude error and
can be expressed in N-m/deg or N-m/rad. The position gain is selected by the designer
and must be high enough to provide the required attitude control accuracy in the
presence of disturbances, or K, 2 Tp/@,, where K, is position gain, Tp is peak distur-
bance torque, and @, is allowable attitude error.

The value of the position gain also determines the attitude control system band-
width and speed-of-response. The bandwidth is given by , = (K, /D)/?, where lis the
spacecraft moment of inertia. The bandwidth defines the frequency at which control
authority begins to diminish. Attitude control and disturbance rejection are effective
from 0 frequency (d.c.) up to the bandwidth. Speed of response is approximately the
reciprocal of bandwidth. Note that position gain is inversely proportional to allowable
error and bandwidth is proportional to the square root of position gain. Therefore, high
accuracy implies high position gain and high bandwidth. However, high bandwidth
may cause bending resonances to affect control system performance.

With the relations given, the system designer can estimate required position gain
from his estimates of disturbance torque and accuracy requirements. He can use this
estimate to compute control system bandwidth. This allows him to specify minimum
bending frequencies as discussed below.

In defining algorithms for the control system, we must also consider whether the
vehicle will have flexible-body effects that can make the vehicle unstable. Spacecraft
with flexible appendages such as antennas, booms, and solar panels may produce
slight warping at their natural frequencies. Control torques and external-disturbance
torques will cause structural vibrations, in some cases close to or within the control
system’s bandwidth. The lowest natural frequencies of flexible components should be
at least an order of magnitude greater than the rigid-body frequencies before we can
neglect flexibility. For further discussion of how structural flexibility affects the
control subsystem, see Sec. 3.12 of Agrawal [1986].

Spin stabilization and momentum bias. The fundamental concept in spin stab-
ilization is the nutation frequency of the vehicle. For a spinning body, the inertial
nutation frequency (@,,;) is equal to

s (11-1)

where J, is the spin axis inertia, 77 is the transverse axis inertia, and @, is the spin
frequency.

For a momentum-bias vehicle with a stable body and a momentum wheel (or a dual-
spin vehicle with a stable platform and a spinning rotor), the nutation frequency is

On =— (11-2)

* In its simplest form, a spacecraft attitude control system can be represented in s-domain as a
1/I,2 plant and may be controlled by a proportional plus derivative (PD) controller where
T, = K, 0, + K, 8, . The position gain, K,, controls system bandwidth and the rate gain, K,,
controls damping.

380 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1

where h is the angular momentum of the spinning body. Thus, spacecraft with large
inertias and small wheels have small nutation frequencies (i.e., long periods).

Attempting to move the vehicle with a bandwidth faster than the nutation frequency
causes it to act more like a 3-axis vehicle. In general, we attempt to control near the
nutation frequency or slower, with correspondingly small torques. In this area, the
vehicle acts like a gyroscope, with the achieved angular rate, @, proportional to the
applied torque, T:

@=Th (11-3)

where h is the system angular momentum.
A lower limit on control bandwidth is usually provided by the orbit rate @,, which

for a circular orbit is
y= ule (11-4)

where pt = 3.986 x 1014 m3/s2 and r is the orbit radius.

Attitude determination. A full discussion of determination algorithms requires a
dedicated reference such as Wertz [1978]. We will highlight only some of the basic
concepts.

The basic algorithms for determination depend on the coordinate frames of interest
(e.g., the sensor frames, local vertical frame, or Earth-centered inertial frame), and the
geometry of the measurements, parameterized by Euler angles (such as roll, pitch, and
yaw) or quaternions (which are scaled vectors for Eigen-axis rotations of coordinate
frames). Inertial platforms and star sensor data usually are suited to inertial quater-
nions, while Earth-pointing spacecraft often use a local-vertical, aircraft-like set of
Euler angles.

Simple spacecraft may use the sensor readings directly for control, while more
complex vehicles or those with higher accuracy requirements employ some form of
averaging, smoothing, or Kalman filtering of the data. The exact algorithms depend on
the vehicle properties, orbit, and sensor types used.

FireSat algorithms. For our momentum-bias FireSat example, control separates
into pitch-axis control using torque commands to the momentum wheel, and roll-yaw
control using current commands to the electromagnets. The pitch-wheel desaturation
commands must also be fed (at a slow rate) to the magnets. The pitch-wheel control is
straightforward, using proportional-plus derivative and, optionally, integral control.
The roll-yaw control design starts by using the linearized nutation dynamics of the
system, and is complicated by the directional limitations of electromagnetic torque
(the achievable torque is perpendicular to the instantaneous Earth magnetic field).

The nadir-oriented control system may use an Earth-referenced, aircraft-like Euler
angle (roll, pitch, yaw) set, although quaternions should also be considered for their
lack of singularities during off-nominal pointing. The horizon sensors directly read
two of the angles of interest, pitch and roll. Yaw needs to be measured directly from
Sun position (during orbit day) or from the magnetometer readings (using a stored
model of the Earth’s field), or inferred from the roll-yaw coupling described earlier.
The magnetic field and Sun information require an uplinked set of orbit parameters,
and increase the computational requirements of the subsystem. Overall, meeting the
0.1 deg yaw requirement when the Sun is not visible will be the toughest challenge
facing the ADCS designer, and a form of coasting through the blackouts, without di-
rect roll-yaw control, may be most appropriate.

11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command 381

11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command

Douglas Kirkpatrick, United States Air Force Academy
Adapted from SMAD II, Sec. 11.2 “Communications,” by John Ford

The telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) or communications subsystem
provides the interface between the spacecraft and ground systems. Payload mission
data and spacecraft housekeeping data pass from the spacecraft through this subsystem
to operators and users at the operations center. Operator commands also pass to the
spacecraft through this subsystem to control the spacecraft and to operate the payload.
We must design the hardware and their functions to pass the data reliably for all the
spacecraft’s operating modes. For a discussion of how we collect and manipulate
housekeeping and payload data, see Sec. 11.3, Chap. 9, and Chap. 16. Chapter 13
discusses the communication link design, and Morgan and Gordon [1989] provide a
wealth of information on spacecraft communications.

The subsystem functions include the following:

Carrier tracking (lock onto the ground station signal)

Command reception and detection (receive the uplink signal and process it)

Telemetry modulation and transmission (accept data from spacecraft systems,
process them, and transmit them)

Ranging (receive, process, and transmit ranging signals to determine the satel-
lite’s position)

Subsystem operations (process subsystem data, maintain its own health and
status, point the antennas, detect and recover faults.)

Table 11-18 presents specific subfunctions to accomplish these main functions.
Subsystem designers must ensure that all of these functions operate reliability to
accomplish the spacecraft mission.

As part of carrier tracking, most satellite TT&C subsystems generate a downlink
RF signal that is phase coherent to the uplink signal. Phase coherence means that we
transmit the downlink carrier so its phase synchronizes with the received phase of the
uplink carrier. This process is the coherent turnaround or two-way-coherent mode.
The coherent turnaround process creates a downlink carrier frequency precisely offset
from the uplink carrier by a predefined numerical turnaround ratio. This is the ratio of
the downlink carrier frequency to the uplink carrier frequency.This operational mode
can only exist when the transmitter phase-locks to the received uplink carrier. For a
given uplink signal, the downlink signal has a constant phase difference. For NASA’s
GSTDN-compatible transponders, the receiver downcoverts the uplink carrier, and
creates a voltage such that the receiver’s voltage-controlled oscillator runs at precisely
2/221 times the uplink carrier frequency. The oscillator frequency goes to the trans-
mitter which multiplies it by a factor of 120. Therefore, the composite transmitter
downlink is 120 x 2/221 = 240/221 times the uplink frequency, which is the turn-
around ratio for NASA-compatible transponders. The turnaround ratio for transpon-
ders compatible with SGLS is 256/205. The two-way-coherent mode allows the
ground station to know more exactly the downlink signal’s frequency and to measure
the Doppler shift, from which it computes the range rate or line-of-sight velocity
between the spacecraft and the tracking antenna. This knowledge allows operators to

TABLE 11-18. What a TT&C Subsystem Does. These are the functions of a communications
subsystem connecting the satellite to the ground or other satellites. In a broad
sense the communications subsystem receives signals from Earth or another
satellite and transmits signals to Earth or another satellite.

Autonomously detect faults and recover communications using stored software sequence

scan fewer frequencies and thus, acquire the spacecraft more quickly. Deep-space
imaging, data collection, and low-Earth orbit spacecraft best illustrate this advantage.
These spacecraft typically have large volumes of data and a short field-of-view time
to the ground station. To receive maximum data at the ground station on a direct down-
link at the spacecraft’s highest rate, operators must acquire the downlink signal in the
minimum time. Also, if they use ranging for navigation, they can calculate range-rate
information from the Doppler shift of the coherent signal.

Occasionally a TT&C subsystem, operating in the two-way coherent mode, loses
lock on the uplink signal. At this point, the spacecraft’s transmitter autonomously
changes the references for the downlink carrier from the receiver’s voltage-controlled
oscillator to the subsystem’s master oscillator. This process creates a unique downlink
frequency which is no longer synchronous with the uplink carrier. This TT&C mode
is two-way noncoherent communications.

For the ranging function (i.e., determining the range or line-of-sight distance), the
ground station may use the ranging method of navigation to track a spacecraft.

11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command 383

Depending on the communication standard, the ground station modulates a pseudo-
random code, tones, or both onto the command uplink signal. The TT&C subsystem’s
receiver detects the code or tones and retransmits them on the telemetry carrier back
to the ground station. From the turnaround time of the ranging code or tones traveling
to and from the spacecraft, the system determines the range. If the downlink carrier’s
phase is coherent with the uplink carrier (two-way coherent mode), we can measure
the Doppler-frequency shift on the downlink carrier signal and thus obtain range-rate
information. Pointing information from the ground station’s directional antenna
allows us to determine the satellite’s azimuth and elevation angles.

Under subsystem operations, the TT&C subsystem performs antenna pointing for
any antenna that requires beam steering. Closed-loop antenna pointing requires special
autotracking equipment. This equipment generates error signals for the guidance,
navigation, and control subsystem, so it can point the antenna. Monopulse and conical-
scan systems are the most common ways of generating pointing error signals.
Monopulse systems use a monopulse feed that generates difference patterns with nulls
on the axis of the azimuth and elevation planes. Conical-scan systems rotate the re-
ceived beam about its axis by a small angle. The rise and fall of the received signal
amplitude per revolution indicates the pointing error. By correlating the feed position
with the position where the signal is at maximum amplitude, the system generates
error signals for the control subsystem to point the antenna. We can use open-loop
antenna pointing when we know the spacecraft antenna’s position and the direction to
the receiver station.

Also under subsystem operations, the TT&C subsystem may do sequences of
mission commands or respond to autonomous commands, such as putting itself in a
safe mode and routing the omni-antenna to the active receiver. For certain failure
scenarios, the subsystem may also execute fault-detection and recovery operations
through a stored software sequence.

To create a robust TT&C subsystem, we must consider and satisfy three parts of
satellite design: requirements, constraints, and regulations. The requirements come
from a variety of sources and form the basis for the mission in which this subsystem
plays a key role. Typically TT&C requirements include:

* Type of signals (voice, television, and data)
* Capacity (number of channels and bandwidth)
* Coverage area & ground site locations (local, regional, national, international)

* Link signal strength (usually derived from ground terminal type)

Connectivity (crosslinks, relay ground stations, and direct links)

Availability (link times per day and days per year, outage times)

* Lifetime (mission duration)

See Sec. 11.2.1 for a more thorough discussion of requirements.

Constraints are limits on the TT&C subsystem from various sources. Power
constraints come from sizing the spacecraft and the power source (primary batteries,
solar panels and secondary batteries, or radioisotope thermoelectric generator). Mass
constraints arise from the mass budget, which comes from the mission design and the
chosen launch vehicle. The launch vehicle generally limits the total dimensions and
mass, so individual subsystems receive their allocation within those limits. The launch

384 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2

vehicle choice also sets the launch vibration and acoustic environment, which places
constraints on the fragility of the subsystem. The interference environment further
constrains the subsystem. When we choose the orbit, we also set the surrounding
interference environment. The owners and developers place cost limits on the total
design, which in turn limits each subsystem. These cost constraints typically deter-
mine how much new technology and subsystem margin that designers can consider.
Many other constraints may arise during design, depending on the mission and the
people involved.

For the TT&C subsystem, international law and regulatory agencies impact design
significantly. Because all spacecraft communicate with users and operators on the
ground, de-conflicting frequencies, orbital locations, and power levels are critical to
civilized sharing of limited resources. So, we must apply to the regulatory bodies for:

* Desired communication frequencies (depending on the mission data rate,
transmission power available, and altitude)

¢ Orbital assignment (further than 2 deg from a satellite with the same fre-
quency, if geosynchronous)

* Desired power flux density on surface (depending on our receiver antennas)

The main regulatory agency enforcing standards is the International Telecommuni-
cations Union (ITU), which is now part of the United Nations. Within the ITU three
bodies regulate the communication allocations: the Consultative Committee on Inter-
national Telephony, the Consultative Committee on International Radiocommu-
nications, and the International Frequency Registration Board (IFRB). The first two
organizations formulate policy and set standards. The IFRB coordinates and approves
frequency and orbit requests. Because these agencies are international and the number
of requests is large and growing, we must plan years in advance to get approval for our
communications request.

Various other bodies exist to assist organizations in coordinating and rationalizing
commercial use of the radio frequency spectrum. Three of these are the International
Telecommunications Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT), the European Telecommu-
nications Satellite Consortium (EUTELSAT), and the International Maritime Satellite
Organization (INMARSAT), which assist their member nations with telecommunica-
tions planning.

11.2.1 Requirements

The TT&C subsystem derives its requirements from many sources, such as (1) the
mission or science objective (top-level requirements such as architecture, orbit life-
time and environment); (2) the satellite (system-level); (3) the TT&C subsystem
(internal requirements); (4) other satellite subsystems; (5) the ground station and any
relay satellite (compatibility); and (6) mission operations (the satellite operational
modes as a function of time). From these sources come the requirements that drive the
subsystem design: (1) data rates (commands and telemetry for health and status or for
mission and science needs); (2) data volume; (3) data storage type; (4) uplink and
downlink frequencies; (5) bandwidths; (6) receive and transmit power; (7) hardware
mass; (8) beamwidth; (9) Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP); and (10) antenna
gain/system noise temperature. Table 11-19 shows the effects of these requirements
on the TT&C-subsystem design.

Classic trade studies include size of the antenna aperture vs. transmitter power,
solid-state amplifiers vs. traveling-wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), and spacecraft
complexity vs. ground complexity. If we increase an antenna’s aperture size, its gain
increases, therefore, we may decrease the transmitter’s RF output power and still
maintain the received signal strength. Unfortunately, large antenna apertures are very
heavy and have narrow beamwidths (producing more stringent pointing require-
ments). As Chap. 13 (Eq. 13-17) shows, the beamwidth decreases with an increase in

386 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2

the antenna’s aperture size. Depending on the frequency and gain needed, we com-
monly decide between solid-state and TWT amplifiers—a system-level trade. To do
so, we must assess the effects of the spacecraft’s total mass, solar-array size, system
reliability, and antenna aperture size. Solid-state amplifiers tend to be more reliable,
lighter, and smaller. TWT amplifiers have a lower technology risk (at higher gains)
and a higher efficiency. We must use TWTAs when the RF output power requirement
is too high at a given frequency for solid-state amplifiers, or when the solid-state
amplifier efficiency is too low for our application. At today’s technology level, we can
design solid-state amplifiers with power levels of 65 W at UHF frequencies, 40 W at
S-band, and about 20 W at EHF frequencies.

The old rule-of-thumb was to keep the satellite as simple as possible by moving all
the complexity and processing to the ground. With modern processors, however, we
can now do a tremendous amount of processing on a satellite. Thus, we can design for
lower downlink data rates and simpler ground stations or we can collect more data
while not overburdening the TT&C subsystem. The new trend is to process as much
information as possible on the satellite whenever the mission or science community do
not need the raw data.

At the system level, the TT&C subsystem can interface with a fixed or a mobile
ground station, as well as a relay satellite. Table 11-20 lists examples of these systems.
We usually select the system-level interfaces when establishing mission, satellite, and
operational requirements.

At the subsystem level, the TT&C subsystem interfaces directly with every sub-
system except for propulsion. The interface with guidance, navigation, and control

deals primarily with antenna pointing. It uses gimbals, or motorized rotary joints, that
move in | or 2 axes to steer the spacecraft’s narrow-beam antennas. Nongimbaled or
fixed directional antennas rely on feed arrays for small movements of the antenna
beam or on spacecraft attitude maneuvers for large movements. The World Adminis-
trative Radio Conference established antenna-pointing requirements for geostationary
satellites. The pointing error must be the smaller value of 10% of the half-power
(-3 dB) beamwidth or 0.3 deg. Table 11-21 summarizes the TT&C subsystem’s
constraints and requirements on other subsystems.

388 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2

The interface with the subsystem for command and data handling passes spacecraft
commands and telemetry, as well as the TT&C subsystem’s control and reporting of
health and status. The interface must allow the system to receive spacecraft commands
while transmitting real-time telemetry. It also must permit safing of the subsystem and
autonomous fault detection and correction.

The interface with the electrical-power subsystem controls the amount and quality
of spacecraft power to the TT&C subsystem. One common design has the electrical-
power subsystem deliver +28 Vdc unregulated to the transponders and other active
boxes in the TT&C subsystem and +28 Vdc regulated to the TWTAs. This design
requires dc-to-dc converters at each piece of equipment to provide the correct voltage
changes. Another interface design centralizes the power conversion and conditioning,
for the TT&C subsystem’s active elements. However, because TWTAs require spe-
cific voltage levels (—1,000 Vdc, +1,000 Vdc, and +4,000 Vdc,), centralized power
conversion and conditioning is not very common with those types of amplifiers.

The payload interface mainly transfers mission or science telemetry data to either
the ground station or a relay satellite. To characterize this interface we must know the
data rate, data volume, and any data storage requirements. This interface may have to
couple signals between the payload and the TT&C subsystem and to modulate the
payload telemetry.

Table 11-22 gives a design process for the TT&C subsystem. Once we state the
performance parameters for TT&C and identify the ground and spaceborne equip-
ment, we use the methods in Chap. 13 to determine overall performance of the
communication links. We must iterate this process many times within the design team
to attain an acceptable spacecraft weight, configuration, and performance level.

11.2.2 Designing the TT&C Subsystem

Table 11-23 lists parameters for the TT&C subsystem we should specify and mon-
itor in addition to the system-level requirements in Table 11-19.

TABLE 11-23, Design Parameters for the TT&C Subsystem. Below are design parameters
for the TT&C subsystem that are not typically specified at the system level. (See
Table 11-19 for system-level parameters.)

Parameter Comment

Antenna Design to minimize. Sidelobes degrade the antenna’s directionality. Very high
Sidelobe sidelobes may interfere with other antennas and receivers on the satellite. High
Levels sidelobe levels also affect security by making detection of signals more likely.

Polarization | Polarizations can be circular (right or left), or linear (horizontal or vertical). To
decrease signal loss in the link, the polarizations need to be compatible. For
example, the satellite antenna and ground station must both have right-circular
polarization.

Frequency When we need to acquire the signal quickly, the receiver frequency must be

Stability known and stable. Thus, we specify the original receiver frequency’s set point,
short-term stability, temperature stability, and aging stability so we can acquire
the uplink signal with little uncertainty.

Capture and | The capture range is the band of frequencies over which the uplink-carrier signal

Tracking can drift from the receiver's best-lock frequency, so the receiver will still lock to

Range the uplink signal. The tracking range is the band of frequencies the receiver will
follow while locked to a sweeping, uplink-carrier signal without losing lock.

Typically the capture range is 1% of the tracking range.

Diplexer The diplexer allows us to use the same antenna for transmitting and receiving.
Isolation The diplexer isolates the transmitter from the receiver. A diplexer with low
isolation may require a band-reject filter between the transmitter and the diplexer.

Coupling Signal and noise coupling between a transmitting antenna and a receiving

Between antenna may cause the receiving antenna to lock onto a frequency coming from

Antennas the transmitting antenna’s transmitter. More commonly, broadband noise from
the transmitting antenna may couple over to the receiving antenna and raise the
noise floor of the receiving antenna’s receiver, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio.

As Table 11-24 shows, selection criteria for TT&C subsystems fall into three
categories: performance, compatibility, and other. Performance is the most important
selection criterion. This subsystem’s hardware must meet specifications of minimum
performance to close the communication link with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio.
The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a Figure of Merit for the digital part of the communication
link. It is the probability that a bit sent over the communication link will be received
incorrectly. We typically specify this rate to be 1 x 10 for the command uplink and
1 x 10° for the telemetry downlink, depending on the nature of the data. To achieve
this rate, the system must meet certain technical specifications: RF power output for
the transmitter, receiver-noise figure, stable oscillator frequency, and the TT&C sub-
system’s front-end losses and antenna gains.

Compatibility is an important selection criterion when the TT&C subsystem must
communicate with existing systems. If the TT&C subsystem must talk to the ground
stations in the Space Ground Link System (SGLS), then the transponder must be com-
patible with SGLS. Likewise, if it must talk to the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite
System (TDRSS), the cross-link transponder must be compatible with TDRSS.

system level fall into three broad categories: performance, compatibility, and
other. Chapter 13, Table 13-1, shows the selection process for communications

In the “Other” category, heritage is important when the schedule and budget are
tight and technology risk must be low. Typically, we measure heritage in terms of
previous spaceflight experience. A lot of communication hardware meets all three
selection criteria. A typical SGLS transponder (1) can close the links to the ground
stations with an acceptable bit error rate, (2) is compatible with the ground stations in
the SGLS, and (3) has flown before.

Figure 11-4 diagrams a generic TT&C subsystem. A typical subsystem contains
two transponders (for redundancy). The transmitter (downlink) path is as follows.
From the left side of Fig. 11-4, two digital bit streams enter the transponder. One enters
either from data storage or real-time from the payload. The other stream comes from
command and data handling with telemetry data on health and status. These two data
streams are modulated onto subcarriers, which are then modulated onto the carrier
output. The composite signal is then amplified and routed out of the transponder and
through a low-pass filter. The filter reduces second and higher-order harmonics to
decrease frequency spurs and intermodulation products from the spacecraft’s receiver.
From the filter, the composite signal travels through a band-reject filter; a double-pole,
double-throw (transfer or 2P2T) RF switch; a diplexer; and finally to the antenna
where it radiates to the ground station. The band-reject filter is a notch filter that
attenuates frequencies coming from the transmitter and falling within the receiver’s
pass band. This filtering action further isolates the transmitter and receiver signals.
The RF switch selects transmitter A or B and antenna A or B. The diplexer allows a
transmitter and receiver to share the same antenna. It also isolates the transmitter from
the receiver port at the receiver’s center frequency, so the transmitter doesn’t lock,
jam, or damage the receiver.

Fig. 11-4. Block Diagram of a Generic TT&C Subsystem. This subsystem has full redun-
dancy: two transponders with parallel transmit and receive signal paths. The diplexer
allows the same antenna to be used for transmitting and receiving. The band-reject
filter attenuates spurious signals originating from the transmitter at the receiver's
center frequency to help the diplexer isolate the receiver from the transmitter.

The receiver’s uplink path is as follows. First, we assume the equipment modulates
the digital command data onto a subcarrier and further modulates the subcarrier onto
the uplink-carrier frequency to form a composite uplink signal. Then, from the right of
Fig. 11-4, the composite signal enters the subsystem through the antenna. The diplexer
routes the composite signal to the receiver RF switch, which then selects antenna A or
B and receiver A or B. The composite signal travels through the receiver’s low-pass
filter, which rejects unwanted transmitter harmonics and frequency spurs that may
exist above the diplexer’s stop band. The signal then moves into the transponder’s
receiver, which demodulates it and routes the digital-command bit stream to the
command and data handling subsystem.

Figure 11-5 diagrams a typical transponder. The composite uplink signal enters the
receiver, where the command data stream is demodulated from the carrier and subcar-
rier. The data stream enters the command detector, which validates the stream and
forwards the data and receiver-in-lock indicator to the command and data handling
subsystem.

The telemetry on the spacecraft’s health and status, as well as the telemetry from
the mission or science payload, enters the module that conditions it. The telemetry is
modulated onto subcarriers (if applicable) and sent to the exciter/transmitter to be
modulated onto the carrier. If the transponder is in the two-way-coherent mode, the
transmitter generates the downlink carrier with the reference frequency (coherent
drive) from the receiver’s voltage-controlled oscillator. The composite downlink
signal then goes to the ground station for processing.

For the ranging signals, the receiver demodulates the ranging tones or coding from
the composite signal. The tones or pseudorandom noise code then moves to the trans-

amplified, and transmitted out of the transponder.

In a typical 3-axis-stabilized satellite, we mount omni-antennas to the top and
bottom of the satellite. We mount all ground-link antennas to provide an unobstructed
view of Earth and place cross-link antennas to provide an unobstructed view of the
relay satellite. Historically, the TT&C subsystem’s electronics are as close to the
antennas as possible. If we gimbal the antennas, we must make sure the satellite’s
body or other appendages such as the solar arrays do not obscure the antenna’s field
of view.

Spin-stabilized satellites are usually cylindrical, and commonly contain a despun
section. Except for omnidirectional varieties, we must mount antennas on the despun
section. Frequently, we put the RF components and associated electronics on the
despun section to avoid passing RF signals through rotary joints.

From a TT&C point of view, satellites in LEO or in geosynchronous orbit are
similar. The primary differences are the path losses. We compensate for these losses
with either antenna gain or transmitter power. An interesting case involves an antenna
beam providing spot communication from a LEO spacecraft for an area of the Earth.
As the satellite ranges away from the coverage area, the antenna beamwidth to cover
the area decreases. The increased antenna gain resulting from the narrow beamwidth
compensates for the path loss based on the inverse square law. The longer distance
demands no added transmitter power.

Table 11-25 summarizes five ways we can apply a TT&C subsystem. For each
application, the table specifies frequency, modulation, and common antenna
characteristics.

11.3 Command and Data Handling 395

11.3 Command and Data Handling

Richard T. Berget, BF Goodrich Aerospace
Data Systems Division

The command and data handling system, C&DH, performs two major functions. It
receives, validates, decodes, and distributes commands to other spacecraft systems
and gathers, processes, and formats spacecraft housekeeping and mission data for
downlink or use by an onboard computer. This equipment often includes additional
functions, such as spacecraft timekeeping, computer health monitoring (watchdog),
and security interfaces.

While they normally provide independent functions, the combination of command
and data handling into a single subsystem provides an efficient means for autonomous
control of spacecraft functions. An onboard computer or microprocessor can send
commands and monitor telemetry over a single interface with the C&DH system,
allowing the control of multiple subsystems.

The C&DH system’s size is directly proportional to spacecraft complexity. The
more systems a spacecraft has, the more monitoring and configuration capability
required. Reliability concerns alone may double the hardware’s size if we require
redundant C&DH subsystems.

The ideal C&DH system is one which has been proven on another spacecraft and
which requires no modification for the mission under development. However, new
missions are usually supported by systems which evolve from older designs. We make
small improvements in the performance of the systems from the viewpoint of speed,
power, weight, volume, or other operating parameter. In the case of a new or custom
design, extensive testing must simulate the strenuous environments involved in a
space launch and flight.

11.3.1 Introduction to C&DH

Figure 11-6 shows a typical command decoder. Command messages can originate
from an onboard computer, uplink transponders, or a hardline test interface. An
arbitration scheme is necessary for source selection which gives uplink commands
priority. Commands from the computer are delayed until a time slot is available. The
hardline test interface is not active during flight and when in use overrides the other
command sources.

Several standards exist for command message formats. (See CCSDS 201.0-B-1,
1987.) Typically, a command consists of a synchronization code, spacecraft address
bits, command message bits, and error check bits. Received commands are validated
prior to execution. Validation consists of receiving synchronization code, checking
command message length (correct number of bits), exactly matching the spacecraft
address and any fixed-bit patterns (unused message bits), and detecting no errors in an
error check polynomial code. Once the decoder validates a command, it increments a
counter to record the number of executed commands. Then the message bits pass to a
decoder for execution. The command decoder rejects commands that do not pass the
validation criteria and it increments the command reject counter. The data handling
system reads the accept and the reject counters and includes them in the downlink data
to provide operational feedback.

The command decoder determines command output type and the specific interface
channel. A typical system provides two types of output: discrete and serial. Discrete
commands are a fixed amplitude and a fixed pulse duration and consist of two basic

types:

¢ High-Level Discrete Command: A +28 V, 10 to 100 ms pulse used to drive a
latching relay coil or fire an ordnance device.

¢ Low-Level Discrete Command: An open collector or 5 V pulse typically inter-
facing with digital logic.

A serial command is a 3-signal interface consisting of a shift clock, serial command
data, and a data enable used to indicate the interface is active. A portion of the received
command message bits (typically 8 or 16) is sent in serial form to a user subsystem.

The terms data handling and telemetry are often used interchangeably. However,
data handling is more than just telemetry. IEEE Standard 100 offers this definition of
telemetry.

Telemetering (remote metering). Measurement with the aid of intermediate
means that permit the measurement to be interpreted at a distance from the
primary detector. The distinctive feature of telemetering is the nature of the
translating means, which includes provision for converting the measurand
into a representative quantity of another kind that can be transmitted con-
veniently for measurement at a distance. The actual distance is irrelevant.

Data handling combines telemetry from multiple sources and provides it for
downlink or internal spacecraft use. Figure 11-7 illustrates a typical spacecraft data-
handling unit.

Most data handling systems are of the time-division multiplexed type. These
systems sequence through their inputs in a predetermined order, then organize them in
a fixed output format. Other systems process inputs as lists of data samples and/or
allow random access by an onboard computer. Input signal sampling rate is
determined by signal bandwidth. Sample rate must be a minimum of two times the

greatest frequency component contained in the signal. (See Sec. 13.2 for a more in-
depth discussion on data rates.) Data from all inputs is converted to digital form and
formatted into a serial stream of continuous data for downlink. The data rate is the sum
of all input sample rates plus some bandwidth for insertion of synchronization codes
and a frame identification counter. IRIG Standard 106, Chap. 4, provides a detailed
discussion of downlink telemetry formats and associated format terms.

The data handling system may also supply telemetry to an onboard computer. The
computer sends its request to the data handling system which processes the input and
returns telemetry data. This operation is interleaved with downlink telemetry gather-
ing which is usually continuous.

Analog telemetry data comes to the data handling equipment in many forms. Often,
direct transducer outputs require signal conditioning prior to conversion from analog
to digital form. Data handling hardware is simplified, however, when input signals are
preconditioned or fall in the general categories described below.

¢ High-Level Analog: A telemetry channel with information encoded as an
analog voltage, typically in the range of 0 to 5.2 V. These are active analog
inputs in that the command and data handling system does not provide
measurement excitation. Data handling equipment converts this information to
digital form.

¢ Low-Level Analog: A telemetry channel with information encoded as an
analog voltage. The signal range is low enough to require amplification before
the information is encoded into digital form. Typical gain values fall between
100 to 300. Because of the signal’s low voltage range, it is subject to noise
contamination and thus uses an interface in which the telemetry information is
the difference between signal and reference inputs to the command and data
handling system. This is differential or double-ended interface.

398 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3

* Passive Analog: A telemetry channel with information encoded as a resis-
tance. The command and data handling system supplies a constant current to
the resistive sensor and encodes the resulting IR voltage drop into a digital
word.

All analog telemetry is converted to digital form within the command and data
handling system. The system determines data resolution by the number of quantization
levels. More information on this topic may be found in Chap. 13.

The two most common forms of digital telemetry data are described below:

* Bi-Level (Discrete) Input: A telemetry channel conveying two state infor-
mation (such as on/off or enable/disable). Information is encoded as voltages,
but may be encoded as a resistance or the presence or absence of a signal.
Typically a logic 0 =0 to 1 V, and a logic 1 = 3 V to 5 V (or 3 V to 28 V).

Serial Telemetry (Digital) Interface: A 3-signal interface used to transfer
digital data from an external source to the data handling equipment. The
command and data handling system provides a shift clock and an interface
enable signal to control data transfer. Interface circuits may be differential line
drivers or single ended. Serial rather than parallel interfaces are preferred on
spacecraft, because they simplify cable design and require fewer interface
circuits.

11.3.2 C&DH System Sizing Process

Table 11-27 summarizes the command and data handling subsystem estimating
process. The desired output of this process is a reasonable estimate of the hardware
necessary to support the mission including estimate of its size, weight, and power. Use
this table in conjunction with Tables 11-28 and 11-29 to assist in estimating the system
parameters in the case of unknowns. The results may then be fed back into the mission
design process and adjusted as necessary. FireSat has been used as an example to
illustrate the process and highlight the main points of estimating when the majority of
needed inputs are unknown or flexible.

Step 1—Identify Functions to be Performed by the C&DH System. The first
step in baselining the command and data handling system is to define the primary
functional requirements needed to monitor and control the spacecraft. At a minimum,
most missions require command processing and housekeeping data acquisition. The
size and complexity of these two systems is determined by the spacecraft design, the
technical requirements, and additional functions and subsystems supported.

Command Processing
There are three primary considerations for baselining a command decoder:
¢ The number of command output channels
« Any requirement for stored commands
¢ Any requirement for computer commands or ACS functions
Table 11-28 gives guidelines for channel counts and sizing. As the spacecraft
design evolves, we refine the needed quantities and types of channels. Whenever
possible, interfaces to the C&DH system should be standardized as a means of saving

cost, but this is not mandatory. The C&DH system is an excellent place to put space-
craft functions that do not seem to fit anywhere else.

We must include the capability to store commands if we require spacecraft control
when its not in view of its ground stations, or as a means of recovery if the communi-
cation link is lost. These commands may be controlled by matching a time-tag or by a
simple delay counter from a controlled timing event. Stored commands of this type
may be easily implemented without a general-purpose processor,

We must add an onboard computer if we require a decision-making element on the
spacecraft. Once we establish the need for a computer, we can plan to use it to perform
many functions including the stored command capability, attitude control algorithms,
and data processing and storage. Integrating attitude control with the command system
will typically add some special interface requirements for driving control elements.

Telemetry Processing
The data handling system provides the ability to acquire data for:

« Spacecraft housekeeping data (health and status)
¢ Feedback for onboard control of spacecraft functions

* Routing of payload or subsystem data to and from receivers and transmitters,
storage or affected system controllers

The quantity of telemetry input channels required for monitoring spacecraft health
is typically directly proportional to the size, complexity, and quantity of payloads and
subsystems involved in meeting the primary and secondary missions. The majority of
these channels are standard interfaces to temperature, pressure, and voltage trans-
ducers. Some subsystems provide the ability to monitor their own health and integrate
the information into a data stream. For new subsystems, the awareness of what the data
handling system can do for them may prevent an unusual design or duplication of a
large amount of circuitry.

The data handling system may acquire payload or subsystem data also. Of critical
importance to the system design is the quantity of data and its transfer rate. The telem-
etry acquired for spacecraft health is limited in speed due to the time necessary to
accurately convert analog signals to digital information. If a subsystem or payload data
stream exceeds 200 kbps or is greater than a few thousand bits in size, it is usually
necessary to provide data buffers or to process the data in a separate section of the data
handling system. Often, an interleaver may be provided to integrate and synchronize
the health and payload data into a single stream.

If an onboard computer is available, it may require additional signals to perform its
tasks. These signals may not be needed in the downlink telemetry format. Therefore,
it is usually preferable for the computer to have the capability to request data
independently of the preprogrammed downlink format. The computer may also be
used to preprocess subsystem and health data to reduce the downlink bandwidth
requirement. (See Chap. 16 for a discussion of onboard processing.)

Other Functions

Time. Most spacecraft designs require the availability of a time word (universal
time, mission elapsed time, or delay) for support of attitude control, stored command-
ing, or data time-tagging. Several systems can provide this time, including GPS
receivers, computer-maintained counters, and hardware timers. The most critical
parameters for the definition of this function are:

¢ Time word granularity

11.3 Command and Data Handling 401

¢ Stability requirement
¢ Acceptable uncertainty

Granularity defines the smallest increments of time maintained for use on the
spacecraft or of interest on the ground. This value is usually driven by the accuracy of
time needed for data time-tagging or the attitude control system. Typically this is one
millisecond or one microsecond. Over specifying this value will increase the hardware
required, increase the cost, and decrease the available bandwidth for data. IRIG-B time
code generators transmit a 1-sec resolution time word and a 1-MHz oscillator to allow
the user to create their own smaller granularity time.

The aging characteristics of the primary oscillator, which drives the timing system,
determines the drift characteristics of the time word. Oscillators are typically specified
by long-term and short-term stability in parts per million (ppm) over a given time.
Selection of this stability determines the allowable error in the onboard time between
time updates from the ground. The same stable oscillator may be used to provide other
oscillator frequencies to other spacecraft subsystems. Occasionally, the stability
needed by the other system may be the driving factor.

Maintaining time with the spacecraft computer is possible using internal registers
and a periodic interrupt signal. However, additional uncertainty may be induced due
to the nonsynchronous nature of a processor under interrupt control. Higher priority
interrupts may delay the update of the time word. If other subsystems need a time base,
the designer must include additional registered circuitry.

Computer Watchdog. When a spacecraft computer is used to provide decision-
making capability on orbit, it is common to provide a method of determining a
computer failure independent of the processor itself. This function may be integrated
into the C&DH system and is usually referred to as the watchdog timer.

The watchdog timer ensures that the computer hardware and software functions as
planned. A hardware or software anomaly could be catastrophic to the spacecraft
mission if we don’t provide a means of correcting the problem. Typically, this function
uses One Or more timers which must be reset by the onboard computer prior to timing
out. The computer resets the timer by writing a specific data word to a specific address.
If this is not accomplished prior to the time-out, the watchdog will execute a predeter-
mined recovery action. The recovery may be a computer reset, interrupt, or a disable
which is maintained until cleared by a ground command.

Attitude Control System Functions. Integrating attitude control functions into the
C&DH system may reduce the hardware required on the spacecraft by taking advan-
tage of C&DH circuitry that is available in other subsystems. The integration of
command, telemetry and onboard computer functions allows closed-loop monitoring
and control with the addition of interface channels specific to the attitude control
function. These channels may be high current, high accuracy, or other special require-
ment interfaces. In some cases, the attitude control section provides only controlling
signals, with the high power and signal conditioning circuitry integrated into the
attitude control component.

Spares. As the baselining process continues, we develop an estimate of the I/O
channel quantities, and use this estimate in step 3 to estimate system parameters.
Unfortunately, I/O channel quantities tend to increase, as the spacecraft becomes more
defined. Therefore, it is common practice to include 10% to 25% additional channels in
the count for unforeseen growth requirements. We should use the channel count,
including spares, to estimate system complexity in Table 11-28. This estimate must be

402 Spacecraft Subsystems 113

documented carefully to prevent several increases as the concept proceeds through the
various departments and levels of management involved in the spacecraft design. As
always, more hardware increases the cost, size, weight, and power of the system.

Step 2—Identify Requirements and Constraints. Once the functions required by
the command and data handling system have been determined, requirements and
constraints imposed by external factors must be identified. We don’t control these
requirements and constraints and they may affect one or more aspects of the C&DH
system design. Early identification and response to these issues may minimize the cost
impact and design problems.

Spacecraft Bus Constraints. The physical size of a spacecraft and its design will
often direct the ultimate configuration of the command and data handling system. In
general, the C&DH system may be divided into three classes or architectures:

* Single-unit systems
¢ Multiple-unit, distributed systems

¢ Integrated systems

A single-unit C&DH system provides one unit for the command system and one
unit for the telemetry system or a single unit which integrates both functions. Although
the single-unit design may be simple and centralize functions, it can have a significant
disadvantage on a medium to large spacecraft bus. As mentioned previously, a larger
spacecraft will generally require a larger number of subsystems and associated inter-
faces and health monitors. A single-unit system requires every interface wire to be
routed to a single physical location for monitoring and control. The result can be a wire
harness that is larger than the unit itself and significantly impacts the weight budget.

Multiple-unit C&DH systems provide a potential solution to this problem and
others. A multiple-unit system provides “remote” command and data handling capa-
bilities in locations physically removed from the “central” unit. The number of
remotes is driven by the spacecraft bus design or the quantity of I/O channels. One
example is the design of a dual-spin satellite in which every signal must be transferred
between the spinning and fixed sections of the satellite over a slip-ring interface. Slip
rings limit the quantities of signals which may be practically routed and also compli-
cate the design due to induced noise. One practical solution is to provide a remote unit
on the spinning side which communicates with the central unit over a digital data bus.
This allows the acquisition of hundreds of channels on the spinning side while requir-
ing only 2 to 6 wires to pass through the slip rings.

Integrated C&DH systems typically combine command, telemetry, flight process-
ing, and attitude control into one system. These systems tend to be small LightSat-type
applications which use a single computer to monitor and control the satellite or a large
high-performance system which uses multiple computers and subsystems coordinated
by a central high-power processor. This type of system may provide a reduced hard-
ware requirement and cost due to the increased capability provided by the processor.
However, this system will most likely entail increased software costs associated with
the increased programming requirements.

Reliability. The reliability required of the C&DH system will affect the system
design in two areas: redundancy and parts quality. A low failure rate for the system
provides a high confidence factor in the success of the mission. Reliability is dramat-
ically increased by including a redundant system for all mission-critical components.
Configuring a system in this manner will obviously increase the amount of hardware

11.3 Command and Data Handling 403

involved. More hardware means increasing the recurring cost, but not necessarily
double the total procurement cost. Many cost items involved in manufacturing the
system are fixed whether a single-string or redundant system is built.

Parts quality also affects the reliability of a system. Increasing the parts quality does
not increase the amount of hardware; however, it does significantly increase cost.
Specifying a Class “S” parts program (or indirectly requiring it via the reliability
requirement) typically multiplies the material cost by 400% to 500%.

Radiation. The areas affected most by the radiation requirement are cost and
schedule. System size and weight may be affected if we require shielding of electronic
components. A radiation environment limits the part types available to the designer
and system performance is typically lower due to required derating. Predicting circuit
behavior is accomplished by modeling, simulation, and analysis. Environment sever-
ity may double system development time and increase parts costs by a factor of 10.

Program Constraints. The foundation of any hardware development program lies
in the constraints placed upon the program to carry out the mission. In some cases,
program constraints initially restrict a design so the desired mission cannot be accom-
plished. The budget allocated for the program will typically be the most limiting con-
straint in the development of the spacecraft and, in turn, command and data handling.
Allocating a budget for a LightSat will clearly preclude developing a spacecraft and
support systems for a national-asset satellite.

If managers define a budget, it will become the primary driver in determining the
other elements of the definition process. In the case of a preliminary study, the objec-
tive may be to define the budget needed to achieve the desired mission goals. In this
case, the later steps become the determinant and the dollars needed become the output
of the process.

The second significant program constraint is commonly schedule. Most space-
qualified electronic systems are custom designs or semicustom implementations of
existing hardware. The need dates for hardware may completely determine which
approach we take to develop hardware. Typical lead times for command and data
handling equipment are 12 to 18 months for systems using Class B parts and 24 to 30
months for systems using Class S parts. These schedule times are almost completely
driven by the lead time involved in the procurement of electronic piece parts. There-
fore, a fast delivery requirement to support an urgent mission will affect the parts and
reliability level of the unit.

Step 3—Determine the Complexity of C&DH Functions. Table 11-28 may be
used to provide a first-order estimate of the complexity_of each C&DH function. There
are no absolutes in this stage of the process. The estimate is the result of the C&DH
“feel” obtained by comparing known general requirements with those listed in the
table. The result is a bounding of the system definition into one of three zones. We
must define C&DH system drivers which may move the components between zones
in the case of an unclear definition. Once a determination is made on the function
complexities, steps 4 and 5 provide an estimate of the system size, weight, and power
specifications. As can be seen in the FireSat example, all the requirements do not have
to be defined to make a first-order estimate.

Step 4—Determine Overall C&DH Level of Complexity. Functions described as
“other” are now collected into the command and telemetry components. Typically, the
mission time clock is included in the telemetry component. The computer watchdog is
included in the command component because a computer failure often requires space-
craft reconfiguration via the command system. ACS functions are included in both.

11.3 Command and Data Handling 405

Composite complexity is determined by scoring the functions complexity and
system drivers for each component (command and telemetry), giving the most weight
to system drivers. The FireSat example appears to be satisfied with a “simple” system
approach with one exception. The high-speed payload data requirement must be
addressed to prevent this requirement from becoming the system design driver. The
impact must be evaluated for the mission design. Potential solutions include a sep-
arate data link, onboard data compression to reduce bandwidth, and additional
research to determine if the 150 Mbps requirement is really needed to accomplish the
mission.

The reliability requirement specified for FireSat causes a significant impact on the
system design and cost. To achieve the desired rating, the systems must be configured
redundantly and manufactured using Class S parts. This information, its impact and
alternatives, should be fed back into the mission design process as early as possible.

Step 5—Estimate Size, Weight, and Power for Each Component. The results of
steps 3 and 4 may now be used in conjunction with Table 11-29 to obtain an estimate
of the system parameters. The “feel” of the system or the desired design margin will
determine the selected value within each zone.

TABLE 11-29. Parametric Estimation of C&DH Size, Weight, and Power. Peak command
power will vary by command type, duration, and load. Nominal command power
will be higher if ACS drivers are required.

Command and data handling systems are generally conservative, evolutionary
designs due to their mission-critical nature. The baselining process presented provides
the mission designer with an approach to making a first-order estimate of the necessary
hardware based upon previous hardware developments. This approach will provide a
realistic estimate to be used in mission resource budgeting.

It is important to identify the rationale and drivers for the baseline. If possible, each
specification should be allocated a rating or confidence factor to indicate if the speci-
fication is required, flexible, or merely a place holder. This information may allow the
mission design team more creativity in solving a given technical problem.

11.3.3 C&DH Basics

This section is a list of details of great concern to command and data handling
system design and operation. Many of these concerns are of absolute necessity when
determining C&DH requirements and generating procurement specifications. Empha-
sis is placed on the command system because of the severity of the effects if these
guidelines are not followed. Data handling basics such as data rates and the number of
bits per sample are covered in Sec. 13.2.

Interfaces to other equipment must be protected so that their faults do not propagate
into the command decoder.

It is paramount that no commands or any transient signals appear on command
outputs during application or removal of prime power, or during under/over prime
power voltage conditions.

It is a basic philosophy of command decoder designs that if the integrity of a
command message is in doubt, the command is not issued. It is rejected! This is espe-
cially true when firing an ordnance device or the spacecraft is launched from a manned
vehicle. It is for this reason that received command messages are not corrected,
although the capability exists, using error check bits.

For safety concerns, operations such as firing ordnance, an engine, or thruster,
require multiple commands configured in series forming a logical AND function. No
single command causes the operation to occur. In a typical ordnance application, three
commands are required: safe, arm, and fire. In this case, safe and arm are relays that
enable a high level discrete command, fire. The commands must (shall) be isolated
within the command decoder such that no single component or physical failure results
in inadvertent function execution. To achieve this, the Hamming distance of control-
ling command messages must be two or greater (for isolation in the decoding scheme),
and command outputs must be physically isolated to the greatest extent possible using
different decoding circuits and interface connectors.

It is advised not to have any commands that turn a command decoder off during
flight. In addition, there should be no commands that interrupt the uplink source to the
command decoder.

In redundant applications, where command outputs are cross strapped, the interface
circuits and interconnection have to be designed such that no single component or
physical failure prevents the active output from functioning. Along the same lines,
where telemetry inputs and serial interface outputs are cross strapped, the interface
circuits and interconnections have to be designed such that no single component or
physical failure prevents the interface from functioning.

The rising and falling edges of discrete command and serial telemetry outputs are
often limited in frequency content so that they are not a source of noise emissions on
the spacecraft.

11.3.4 A Final Note

The C&DH subsystem is often one of the last on the spacecraft to be defined. It is
a tool, used to configure, control, or program the payload and other spacecraft
subsystems. It is the spacecraft’s senses reporting internal environment, health, and
status information. C&DH equipment cannot be completely defined until the require-
ments of other systems have been established. The mission designer’s main task is that
of listing the command, telemetry and other data needs for each spacecraft system. The
list must also include the rate at which commands are issued and telemetry is gathered
for determination of composite data rates. Issues such as data format, encoding, and

11.4 Power 407

security must then be addressed. At this point it may be advantageous to stop and take
an overall view of the spacecraft for other functions, which if included in the C&DH,
would simplify overall design. Remember that the C&DH interfaces to nearly all
spacecraft functions. Next the impact of the mission environments, duration and
required reliability on the C&DH hardware is assessed. When these tasks are complete
the C&DH subsystem can be fully characterized.

As illustrated in Fig. 11-8, the electrical power subsystem (EPS) provides, stores,
distributes, and controls spacecraft electrical power. Table 11-30 lists typical functions
performed by the EPS. The most important sizing requirements are the demands for
average and peak electrical power and the orbital profile (inclination and altitude). We
must identify the electrical power loads for mission operations at beginning-of-life,
BOL, and end-of-life, EOL.

For many missions, the end-of-life power demands must be reduced to compensate
for solar array performance degradation. The average electrical power needed at EOL
determines the size of the power source. Section 10.3 shows a sample power budget
that we may use to begin the sizing process. We usually multiply average power by 2
or 3 to obtain peak power requirements for attitude control, payload, thermal, and EPS
(when charging the batteries). Fortunately, all the systems do not require peak power
at the same time during the mission.

mission requirements on the power system design. We will work through the design
process, beginning with the selection of a power source.

11.4.1 Power Sources

The power source generates electrical power within the spacecraft. Launch vehicles
such as Titan IV or Delta use primary batteries (discussed in Sec. 11.4.2) as the power
source for electrical loads because the batteries usually need to last less than an hour.
But batteries alone are too massive for missions that last from weeks to years. These
missions need a source that can generate power over many orbital cycles to support
electrical loads and recharge the batteries.

Typically, we use four types of power sources for spacecraft. Photovoltaic solar
cells, the most common power source for Earth-orbiting spacecraft, convert incident
solar radiation directly to electrical energy. Static power sources use a heat source
—typically plutonium-238 or uranium-235 (nuclear reactor), for direct thermal-to-
electric conversion. Dynamic power sources also use a heat source—typically concen-
trated solar radiation, plutonium-238, or enriched uranium—to produce electrical
power using the Brayton, Stirling, or Rankine cycles. The fourth power source is fuel
cells, used on manned space missions such as Gemini, Apollo, SkyLab, and the Space
Shuttle. Table 11-33 provides a comparison of various power sources.

Static power conversion uses either a thermoelectric or a thermionic concept. The
most common static power source for spacecraft is the thermoelectric couple. This
basic converter uses the temperature gradient between the p-n junction of individual
thermoelectric cells connected in a series-parallel arrangement to provide the desired
dc electrical output from each converter. This temperature gradient comes from slow
decay of the radioactive source. The thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency for a
thermoelectric source is typically 5-8%.

Thermionic energy conversion produces electricity through a hot electrode (emit-
ter) facing a cooler electrode (collector) inside a sealed enclosure that typically
contains an ionized gas. Electrons emitted from the hot emitter flow across the inter-
electrode gap to the cooler collector. There they condense and return to the emitter
through the electrical load connected externally between the collector and the emitter.
We choose the collector and emitter temperatures for best overall system performance.
In choosing the collector temperature, we try to decrease the weight and size of
thermal radiators, and we choose materials based on mission life requirements. Ther-
mionic power sources usually rely on a reactor heat source because of the high
temperature required for efficient thermionic conversion. Power efficiencies for a
thermionic power conversion are typically 10-20%.

In contrast to static sources, dynamic power sources use a heat source and a heat
exchanger to drive an engine in a thermodynamic power cycle. The heat source can be
concentrated solar energy, radioisotopes, or a controlled nuclear-fission reaction. Heat
from the source transfers to a working fluid, which drives an energy-conversion heat
engine. For a dynamic solar-power source, the balance of energy remains as latent and
sensible heat in a heat exchanger (molten eutectic salt), which provides continuous
energy to the thermodynamic cycle during eclipse periods. A dynamic power source
using a nuclear reactor or plutonium-238 decay does not require thermal-energy stor-
age because the source provides continuous heat.

Dynamic power sources use one of three methods to generate electrical power:
Stirling cycle, Rankine cycle, or Brayton cycle. Stirling-cycle engines use a single-
phase working fluid as the working medium. The thermodynamic cycle consists of
two isothermal processes (compression and expansion) and two constant-volume pro-
cesses (heating and cooling). Power-conversion efficiencies for Stirling engines are
25-30%. Rankine-cycle engines are dynamic devices that use a two-phase fluid system

employing a boiler, turbine, alternator, condenser, and pump. This power-conversion
cycle is essentially the same as that used to generate electricity from fossil and nuclear
energy on Earth. Power-conversion efficiencies for Rankine-cycle engines are
15-20%. Brayton-cycle engines are dynamic devices that use a single, compressible
working fluid as the working medium. The thermodynamic cycle consists of adiabatic
compression and expansion stages separated and coupled by stages that add or reject
heat at constant pressure. Placed after the turbine, a recuperator-heat exchanger
improves the cycle’s efficiency. Power conversion efficiencies for the Brayton cycle
are 20-35%.

11.4 Power 411

Fuel cells convert the chemical energy of an oxidation reaction to electricity. They
are self-contained generators that operate continuously without sunlight, but must
carry their own reactant supply, usually. The longer the mission, the larger the reactant
tanks. The most popular version for space applications is the hydrogen-oxygen
(referred to as “alkaline” because of the KOH electrolyte) fuel cell because of its
relatively high specific power (275 W/kg on the Space Shuttle), low reactant mass
(hydrogen and oxygen), and useful by-product (water).

A typical single cell produces a voltage of 0.8 Vdc. In combination, a fuel cell unit
can create many kilowatts of power (each Shuttle fuel cell produces 16 kW peak or
12 kW continuous). The energy conversion efficiency can run as high as 80% for low
current draws, but as current increases, the efficiency drops to 50-60%, due to activa-
tion overpotential and electrical resistance in the electrolyte solution between elec-
trodes. However, compared with other power sources, fuel cell efficiencies are high.

The three Space Shuttle fuel cells are state-of-the-art power generators that produce
all of the Shuttle electricity for the 28 Vdc bus. Their high efficiency (70%), low
weight (118 kg), and excellent reliability (> 99% available) attest to their quality.
Other important factors are their 15-min start-up time, instantaneous shutdown, and
long lifetime (2,400 hours before refurbishment). Besides electricity, these fuel cells
produce crew drinking water, at a rate of 0.36 kg/kWh, or about 104 kg a day.”

Research is underway to solve the short-mission limit with fuel cells, caused by
carrying large reactant masses. Because the fuel-cell reaction is reversible, we can use
electrolysis to create more reactants from the water by-product. To optimize each pro-
cess, however, we have to use separate units for generating electricity and separating
the water. Any long-duration mission could use this regenerative system if it had some
input electricity from solar cells, nuclear generators, or other power system during
periods of low electrical load.

Earth-orbiting spacecraft at low-Earth to geosynchronous orbits have usually
employed photovoltaics as their power source. Often, photovoltaics were the only real
candidate for these low-power missions (less than 15 kW) because solar cells were
well-known and reliable. Photovoltaic sources are not attractive for interplanetary
missions to the outer planets because solar radiation decreases, thus reducing the avail-
able energy from a solar array. To configure and size a solar array, we must understand
cell types and characteristics; solar-array design issues, types, sizing calculations, con-
figurations, regulation; and radiation and thermal environments. Key design issues for
solar arrays include spacecraft configuration, required power level (peak and average),
operating temperatures, shadowing, radiation environment, illumination or orienta-
tion, mission life, mass and area, cost, and risk. Table 11-34 shows the solar array
design process.

Step 1. Mission life and the average power requirement are the two key design
considerations in sizing the solar array for most spacecraft. We size a photovoltaic
system to meet power requirements at EOL, with the resulting solar array often over-
sized for power requirements at BOL. This excess power at BOL requires coordinated
systems engineering to avoid thermal problems. The longer the mission life, the larger
the difference between power requirements at EOL and BOL. We usually consider
photovoltaics a poor power source for missions lasting more than 10 years because of
natural degradation in the solar array. Section 11.4.4 discusses how we manage excess
power from the solar array. The average power requirement can be obtained from
Secs. 10.1 and 10.2.

11.4 Power 413

In designing a solar array, we trade off mass, area, cost, and risk. Silicon presently
costs the least for most photovoltaic power applications, but it often requires larger
area arrays and more mass than the more costly gallium-arsenide cells. Programs for
which mass and volume (solar array area) are critical issues may allow higher costs or
technical risks. They could select a system based on gallium arsenide or some other
advanced type of solar cell. Risk develops from the unproven reliability and fabrica-
tion of the photovoltaic source.

A solar array’s illumination intensity depends on orbital parameters such as the Sun
incidence angles, eclipse periods, solar distance, and concentration of solar energy.
Tracking and pointing mechanisms on the solar array often adjust for these influences.
If we mount the cells on the body of the spacecraft, we must orient them so they will
generate adequate power throughout the mission.

Step 2. To estimate the solar-array area required for a spacecraft, we first determine
how much power, P,,, the solar array must provide during daylight to power the
spacecraft for the entire orbit

[He a)
xX Xq
Ea a

(11-5)

where P, and P, are the spacecraft’s power requirements (excluding regulation and
battery charging losses) during eclipse and daylight, respectively, and 7, and T, are
the lengths of these periods per orbit. The terms X, and X, represent the efficiency of
the paths from the solar arrays through the batteries to the individual loads and the path
directly from the arrays to the loads, respectively. The efficiency values for eclipse and
daylight depend on the type of power regulation: direct energy transfer or peak-power
tracking. (A description of these methods follows in Sec. 11.4.4.) For direct energy
transfer, the efficiencies are about X, = 0.65 and XJ = 0.85; for peak-power tracking
they are X, = 0.60 and X, = 0.80. The efficiencies of the former are about 5% to 7%
greater than the latter because peak-power tracking requires a power converter
between the arrays and the loads.

Step 3. Table 11-35 shows the efficiencies and radiation-degradation sensitivities
of three main types of cells. Gallium arsenide has the advantage of higher efficiencies,
whereas indium phosphide reduces the degrading effects of radiation. Silicon solar cell
technology is mature and has the advantage of lower cost per watt for most applica-
tions. Gallium arsenide and indium phosphide cost about 3 times more than silicon.

The energy-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is defined as the power output
divided by the power input. The power input value for a planar solar array is the solar-
illumination intensity (1,367 W/m2). Thus, a solar panel with a BOL efficiency of 18%
will provide 246 W/m2. We must be aware that reported efficiency values for solar
panels often apply only to single cells. We need to identify losses inherent to panel
assembly (diodes, interconnect cabling, transmission losses) to size the array ade-
quately. We also need to note that these efficiency values often refer to laboratory
cells and not production cells, which have lower average efficiencies.

To complete this step, we identify the type of solar cells and how their performance
will degrade during the mission. Ideally, silicon and gallium arsenide solar cells have
efficiencies of about 14.8% and 18.5%. These solar cell efficiencies give us ideal solar
cell output performance per unit area, P,, of 202 W/m2 and 253 W/m2, respectively,
if the incident solar radiation (1,367 W/m2) is normal to the surface.

Step 4. Next, we must determine the realistic power production capability of the
manufactured solar array. As shown in Table 11-36, an assembled solar array is less
efficient than single cells due to design inefficiencies, shadowing and temperature
variations, collectively referred to as inherent degradation, I. Solar cells are applied
to a substrate, usually honeycomb aluminum, and interconnected, resulting in losses
of 10% of the solar array’s substrate area. This accounts for the design and assembly
losses. If we configure the spacecraft well, its appendages will shadow few cells, and
shadowing losses should be slight. The temperature of a typical flat solar panel receiv-
ing normal incident radiation ranges from about 67 °C in LEO to 53 °C in GEO. The
reference temperature for silicon solar cells is 28 °C, with performance falling off
0.5% per degree above 28 °C. Body-mounted arrays on nonspinning spacecraft are
typically about 5 °C warmer than deployed solar arrays because they can’t radiate heat
into deep space as efficiently.

TABLE 11-36. Elements of Inherent Solar Array Degradation. Although individual solar cells
may have adequate efficiency, after we manufacture the solar array, these
elements cause some degradation in the cumulative efficiency by the amounts
indicated.

As mentioned earlier, we commonly refer to the current-voltage characteristics of
a solar cell as the I-V curves. Figure 11-9 depicts a first-quadrant I-V curve for a
planar array in LEO. This curve characterizes BOL and EOL performance. As the
figure illustrates, the three significant points for solar-array design are:

¢ Peak-power point, where voltage times current is maximized

Fig. 11-9. I-V Plot for a Planar Array. The power available is simply the area under the curve.

We must also consider how temperature affects the I-V characteristics. While the
spacecraft is in eclipse, the solar-array temperature can get as low as —80 °C. The high-
est operating temperature for an LEO spacecraft solar array is 100°C, occurring near
the end of a full Sun period during an orbit.

The operating temperature of the array is a key issue because the solar cell’s per-
formance depends on temperature. A current-voltage, or I-V plot, illustrates the
performance of a solar-array cell, or the array (see Fig. 11-9). A change in the operat-
ing temperature of the solar cell or array causes three changes in the I-V curve:

¢ A scaling of the I-V curve along the current axis
¢ A translation or shifting of the I-V curve along the voltage axis
* A change in the I-V curve shape affecting the roundness of the knee region

The temperature coefficient, or percent degradation of performance with increasing
temperature, for any solar cell depends on factors such as the type of cell and its
output-power characteristics, actual operating temperature, and radiation environ-
ment. Gallium arsenide and indium phosphide have lower temperature coefficients,
but higher temperature still means reduced performance. Solar arrays using gallium
arsenide and indium phosphide also resist radiation better than silicon and provide
greater EOL power for a given area. We must establish a profile for operating temper-
atures during a mission, so the photovoltaic system can generate adequate power
throughout.

The peak-power point depends on the array’s operating temperature at BOL and
EOL. Thus, an array often provides maximum power coming out of an eclipse period
because it is at its coldest operating temperature. Transient voltage excursions often
occur when leaving eclipse, so we may need to clamp voltages to protect spacecraft
loads. By understanding how the array’s performance relates to these variables, we can
get the highest output power from the array.

Usually, solar cells in series-parallel combinations make up a solar array. The
number of series-connected solar cells in one string establishes the bus voltage

416 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4

required at EOL at the operating temperature; the number of parallel strings depends
on the required current output. Isolation diodes mounted within the solar array
typically minimize the effects of shadowing and reversed-biased solar cells.

Solar-array configurations are either planar or concentrator, and either type can be
body- or panel-mounted. Most photovoltaic applications to date have employed a
planar array in which solar cells are mounted onto a surface (typically insulated alu-
minum honeycomb) with an adhesive. A Kapton, Kevlar, or fiberglass sheet usually
insulates the solar cell from the aluminum honeycomb support structure. Concentrator
solar arrays increase the solar cell’s output by using mirrors or lenses to focus more
solar radiation on the cells.

Panel-mounted solar arrays usually apply only to 3-axis stabilized spacecraft. The
panel-mounted approach tracks and points the solar array to get the best Sun incidence
angle. The body-mounted approach reduces the requirements for tracking and pointing
on any spacecraft (spinning or stabilized). But the less effective Sun incidence angle
and increased array temperature of body-mounted cells produce a lower efficiency in
orbit. Panel-mounted solar arrays are usually mounted on a boom. Deployable panel
arrays are either flexible or rigid, according to the type of substrate material employed
for mounting. For most spacecraft, we try to place the solar array away from the
payload and other spacecraft subsystems because of the variable and often high
temperature of the solar cells.

Body-mounted planar cells are typical on spinning spacecraft, which provide ther-
mal control by radiating excess heat to space as the spacecraft spins. Body-mounted
solar arrays use cells inefficiently because of higher temperature and reduced voltage.
Thus, they generate lower power per unit area than a deployed, oriented panel. When
solar cells are body-mounted to a spinning spacecraft, the array’s total output power
decreases because the cells are not always oriented toward the Sun. This decrease
depends on the spacecraft’s configuration and the drive mechanisms of the solar array
(if any). For example, a stabilized array using Sun-tracking and pointing on two axes
would fully use the solar array’s surface area. But the array’s reduction in output
power per total surface area would be approximately = for body-mounted cells on a
cylindrical, spinning spacecraft and 4 for body-mounted cells on a cubic-shaped
spacecraft that does not employ active tracking. The output power decreases because
not all cells are illuminated. We must trade the cost and design for the solar array’s
total surface area against the cost and complexity of stabilizing the spacecraft and
using a drive system for the solar array.

Shadowing considerations are important because a solar cell will go into open
circuit (become high resistance) when not illuminated. In a series-connected string of
solar cells, the shadowing of one cell results in the loss of the entire string. Shadowing
may be caused by spacecraft components such as transmitting or receiving antennas,
deployment mechanisms, or structures such as the solar-array. We can reduce shadow-
ing effects by actively pointing and tracking solar arrays on 3-axis stabilized space-
craft, using diodes, or designing series-parallel arrays. On spinning spacecraft, we
must lay out solar cells so all solar cells within a string are illuminated. Diodes, which
bypass groups of solar cells in a string, help prevent damage to reduce the advance
effects of shadowed solar cells.

We can improve solar cell performance with coverslides, coatings, and back-
surface reflectors. Coverslides provide a hermetic seal yet allow the cell to receive
sunlight and reject heat. They are textured or smooth. A textured coverslide is used for
body-mounted solar cells that do not actively point toward the Sun. It reflects incident

11.4 Power 417

solar energy back onto the solar cell, improving the overall efficiency. Smooth cover-
slides are used for spacecraft whose arrays actively track and point. By decreasing
reflective losses on solar cells, coatings allow cells to use more of the incident energy.
Back-surface reflectors direct incident solar radiation that passes through the solar cell
back through the cell again to improve overall efficiency. By reducing solar absorp-
tance, they help the solar array manage thermal energy. Solar-cell vendors are
continually improving the mechanical and thermal characteristics of coverslides, coat-
ings, and back-surface reflectors. Thus, we must coordinate mechanical and thermal
characteristics of these cells with the vendors.
At beginning-of-life, the array’s power per unit area is

Prop, = PyIy.cos 0 (11-6)

where cos @ is referred to as the cosine loss. We measure the Sun incidence angle, 0,
between the vector normal to the surface of the array and the Sun line. So if the Sun’s
rays are perpendicular to the solar array’s surface, we get maximum power. Obviously,
the geometry between the array and the Sun changes throughout the mission and
different solar array panels will have different geometry. We configure the solar array
to minimize this cosine loss. For example, in GEO with a flat, silicon solar array and
a worst-case Sun angle of @ = 23.5 deg angle between equatorial and ecliptic planes
and the nominal value of J,, the power output at beginning-of-life is 143 W/m2.

Step 5. Radiation damage severely reduces a solar array’s output voltage and cur-
rent. At geosynchronous altitude, we must guard against solar-flare protons on-station,
trapped electrons on-station, and trapped electrons and protons during transfer orbits.
(Chapter 8 explains these terms.) Electrons and protons trapped in the Earth’s mag-
netic field cause most degradation of solar cells. Silicon solar cells protected by
coverslides lose 15% of their voltage and current (shielding assumed) when exposed
to a total fluence of 1015 MeV equivalent electrons (4 to 5 years for a LEO spacecraft).
As mission planners, we should coordinate degradation characteristics with the solar-
cell manufacturer, based on the radiation environment the spacecraft will encounter.
Degradation of a solar cell also depends on its design. Advanced technologies, such as
indium phosphide cells, are more radiation hardened.

Next, we must consider the factors that degrade the solar array’s performance
during the mission. Life degradation, Lz, occurs because of thermal cycling in and out
of eclipses, micrometeoroid strikes, plume impingement from thrusters, and material
outgassing for the duration of the mission. In general, for a silicon solar array in LEO,
power production can decrease by as much as 3.75% per year, of which up to 2.5% per
year is due to radiation. For gallium-arsenide cells in LEO, the degradation is about
2.75% per year, of which radiation causes 1.5% per year. The actual lifetime degrada-
tion can be estimated using

La= (1 — degradation/yr) satellite life (11-7)
The array’s performance per unit area at end-of-life is
Prot = Psor La (11-8)

Using the FireSat example array in Table 11-34 for a 5-year mission, Lq is 82.6%, re-
sulting in a’Pep, of 118.1 W/m2. The solar-array area, A,,, required to support the
spacecraft’s power requirement, P,,,, is

Asa = Ba! Peot (11-9)

418 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4

The resulting solar-array area for the example spacecraft is about 2.0 m2. If we had
used a perfectly pointed array, the BOL power would have been 155 W/m2, resulting
in an EOL power of 128 W/m? and an array area of 1.9 m2. So, having to account for
the cosine loss costs us 0.1 m? in array size and the equivalent mass.

Solar-array sizing is more difficult than it appears from the above discussion.
Typically, we must consider several arrays with varying geometry. Also, the angle of
incidence on the array surface is constantly changing. We must predict that angle con-
tinuously or at least determine the worst-case angle to develop an estimate of Pro; .

11.4.2 Energy Storage

Energy storage is an integral part of the spacecraft’s electrical-power subsystem
providing all the power for short missions (< 1 week) or back-up power for longer
missions (> 1 week). Any spacecraft that uses photovoltaics or solar thermal dynamics
as a power source requires a system to store energy for peak-power demands and
eclipse periods. Energy storage typically occurs in a battery, although systems such as
flywheels and fuel cells have been considered for various spacecraft.

A battery consists of individual cells connected in series. The number of cells
required is determined by the bus-voltage. The amount of energy stored within the bat-
tery is the ampere-hour capacity or watt-hour (ampere-hour times operating voltage)
capacity. The design or nameplate capacity of the battery derives from the energy-
storage requirements. Batteries can be connected in series to increase the voltage or in
parallel to increase this current output—the net result being an increase in watt-hour
capacity.

Table 11-37 lists issues to consider early in the conceptual phase of any program.
Most of all, we try to provide a stable voltage for all operating conditions during the
mission life because load users prefer a semi-regulated bus voltage. The difference in
energy-storage voltage between end of charge and end of discharge often determines
the range of this bus voltage.

TABLE 11-37. Issues in Designing the Energy Storage Capability. Energy storage usually
means large batteries and we must consider all their characteristics when
designing this subsystem.

Figure 11-10 highlights the charge-discharge characteristics of a spacecraft’s
energy-storage system. We want a flat discharge curve that extends through most of
the capacity and little overcharge. Overcharging quickly degrades most batteries. We
also need to match the electrical characteristics of the battery cells. Otherwise, charge
imbalances may stress and degrade the batteries, resulting in a shorter life for the
electrical-power subsystem.

All battery cells are either primary or secondary. Primary battery cells convert
chemical energy into electrical energy but cannot reverse this conversion, so they can-
not be recharged. Primary batteries typically apply to short missions (less than one
day) or to long-term tasks such as memory backup, which use very little power. The

Fig. 11-10. Profile of Charge/Discharge Voltages for Batteries. Secondary batteries may cycle
through this type of profile hundreds or thousands of times during their mission life. At
the left edge, the voltage is low because the spacecraft iust came out of eclipse where
it used battery power. During the charge phase, there is positive current from the
power regulator, so the battery voltage rises. In the discharge phase (in eclipse again),
there is a negative current, so the battery voltage decreases.

most common batteries use silver zinc, lithium thionyl] chloride, lithium sulfur dioxide,
lithium monoflouride, and thermal cells. Table 11-38 highlights the applications and
relative merits. It also depicts the wide ranges in each couple’s specific-energy
density. We cannot specify a value for specific-energy density because cells vary in
design and depend on mission requirements. We must coordinate mission require-
ments with the battery manufacturer to specify battery performance.

TABLE 11-38. Characteristics of Selected Primary Batteries. Primary battery manufacturers
can meet power requirements within these ranges of specific energy density. We
must tradeoff cost and mass with capacity while ensuring mission accom-
plishment.

Specific Energy

Silver Zine 60 ~ 130 High rate, short life (minutes)
Lithium Thionyl Chloride 175 — 440 Medium rate, moderate life (< 4 hours)
Lithium Sulfur Dioxide 130 — 350 Low/medium rate, long life (days)
Lithium Monoflouride 130 — 350 Low rate, long life (months)
Thermal 90 — 200 High rate, very short life (minutes)

A secondary battery for energy storage can convert chemical energy into electrical
energy during discharge and electrical energy into chemical energy during charge. It
can repeat this process for thousands of cycles. Table 11-39 shows ranges of specific-
energy density for common secondary batteries. A secondary battery provides power

420 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4

during eclipse periods on spacecraft that employ photovoltaics and can also level
loads. Secondary batteries recharge in sunlight and discharge during eclipse. The
spacecraft’s orbital parameters, especially altitude, determine the number of
charge/discharge cycles the batteries has to support during the mission life. A geosyn-
chronous satellite needs to store energy for two 45-day eclipse periods per year with
eclipses lasting no more than 72 min each day. The geosynchronous orbit demands
few charge/discharge cycles during eclipse periods, thus allowing a fairly high (50%)
depth-of-discharge. On the other hand, LEO spacecraft encounter at most one eclipse
period each orbit or about 15 eclipse periods per day, with maximum shadowing of ap-
proximately 36 min. Therefore, the batteries must charge and discharge about 5,000
times each year, and the average depth-of-discharge is only 15-25%—much lower
than for geosynchronous spacecraft.

TABLE 11-39. Characteristics of Selected Secondary Batteries. Though secondary bat-
teries have much lower specific energy densities than primary batteries, their
ability to be recharged makes them ideal for backup power on spacecraft
powered by solar cells.

Depth-of-discharge (DOD) is simply the percent of total battery capacity removed
during a discharge period. Higher percentages imply shorter cycle life as shown in
Fig. 11-11. Once we know the number of cycles and the average depth of discharge,
we can determine the total capacity of the batteries.

Figure 11-11 illustrates the relationship between average depth-of-discharge
(DOD) and cycle life for secondary batteries using nickel cadmium (NiCd) and nickel
hydrogen (NiH2). Extensive data supports the predictions for both NiCd and NiH).

The NiCd battery is still a common secondary energy storage system for many
aerospace applications. NiCd technology has been space qualified, and we have exten-
sive databases for nearly any mission. A 28 Vdc aerospace NiCd battery usually
consists of 22-23 series-connected cells. NiCd battery cells for aerospace missions
have typical capacities of 5 to 100 Amp-hr.

NiH, technology has been the recently qualified energy storage system of choice
for aerospace applications where higher specific energies and longer life are impor-
tant. The three space-qualified design configurations for NiH, are individual pressure
vessel, common pressure vessel, and single pressure vessel. The individual pressure
vessel was the first NiH» technology used for aerospace application. Here, only a
single electrochemical cell is contained within the pressure vessel. It has a working

terminal voltage of 1.22 to 1.25 Vdc depending upon discharge loads. The typical
individual pressure vessel battery design consists of multiple cells connected in series
to obtain the desired battery voltage. Cell diameters are typically 9 to 12 cm, with ca-
pacity ranges from 20 to over 300 Amp-hr. The common pressure vessel NiH) tech-
nology is very similar to individual pressure vessel, with the primary difference in the
wiring connection of the internal electrode stacks. In the individual pressure vessel, the
electrode stacks are all connected in parallel. In a common pressure vessel, there are
two sets of electrode stacks within the pressure vessel that are series connected, yield-
ing a working terminal voltage of 2.44 to 2.50 Vdc. This design has a higher specific-
energy at the battery level since there are half as many pressure vessels and a signifi-
cant reduction in cell piece-parts. Common pressure vessel NiH, technology has been
space qualified in the 6 cm and 9 cm cell diameter configuration for capacities in the
12 to 20 Amp-hr range. Batteries with larger Amp-hr capacities should be qualified for
aerospace application in the near future. The single pressure vessel NiH, battery is de-
signed such that a common hydrogen supply is used by three or more series connected
cells with a single pressure vessel. Each cell stack contains its own electrolyte supply
which is isolated within individual cell stack containers. The key operating character-
istic of this design is to allow the free movement of hydrogen within the cell stacks
while maintaining cell stack electrolyte isolation. These batteries are presently avail-
able in a 12.5 cm or 25 cm diameter design.

Lithium Ion battery technology offers a significant energy density advantage and a
much wider operating temperature range over NiCd and NiH, battery types. Typical
cell constituents are lithium thionyl chloride, lithium sulfur dioxide, and lithium
carbon monofluoride. The nominal operating voltage for a lithium ion cell is 3.6 to
3.9 Vdc, which allows us to reduce the number of cells by approximately one-third
when compared to NiCd or NiH) cells. The lithium ion secondary battery system
offers a 65% volume advantage and a 50% mass advantage for most present day
aerospace battery applications. Lithium ion battery technology should be qualified for

422 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4

a planetary mission by the year 2000, with space qualification for GEO and LEO
applications by the years 2005-2010.

To size a secondary battery, we must identify the parameters and apply the equation
in Table 11-40. The parameter values used in the equation can vary significantly with
battery type. The ideal battery capacity is the average eclipse load, P,, times the
eclipse duration, T,. This ideal capacity must be increased to include the battery-to-
load transmission efficiency, n, and the depth-of-discharge constraints. For LEO, we
expect the battery’s DOD to be 40-60% for NiH, technology, compared to 10-20%
for NiCd technology. We base these expectations on the average DOD over 24 hours
and assume the batteries are fully recharged at least once during this period. The
number of batteries, VN, may be equal to one for this calculation if you simply require
a battery capacity. Two to five batteries are typical. We must have at least two (unless
the battery uses redundant cells) because the spacecraft needs redundant operation
with one unit failed. But more than five batteries require complex components for
recharging. The secondary batteries may be required to help meet peak power loads
during full Sun conditions. For some missions, the peak power loads may drive the
required battery capacity rather than the eclipse load. To design the Energy-Storage
subsystem, follow the steps in Table 11-40

TABLE 11-40. Steps in the Energy Storage Subsystem Design. To obtain the required
battery capacity in Amp-hr, divide by the required satellite bus voltage.

11.4.3 Power Distribution

A spacecraft’s power distribution system consists of cabling, fault protection, and
switching gear to turn power on and off to the spacecraft loads. It also includes
command decoders to command specific load relays on or off. The power distribution
system is a unique feature of the electrical-power subsystem and often reflects indi-
vidual spacecraft loads and power-switching requirements. Power distribution designs
for various power systems depend on source characteristics, load requirements, and
subsystem functions. In selecting a type of power distribution, we focus on keeping
power losses and mass at a minimum while attending to survivability, cost, reliability,
and power quality.

Power switches are usually mechanical relays because of their proven flight
history, reliability, and low power dissipation. Solid-state relays, based on power tech-
nology, which uses metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors are available.

The load profile of a spacecraft is a key determining factor in the design specifica-
tions of a power distribution subsystem. Predominant spacecraft loads (radar, com-
munications, motors, computers) may require low- to high-voltage dc (5-270 Vdc),
high-voltage single-phase ac (115 Vrms, 60 Hz), or high-voltage three-phase ac
(120/440 Vrms, 400 Hz)—all converted from the 28-Vdc power bus. Because the reg-
ulation requirements for these loads vary, the bus voltage may need further regulating,
leveling up or down, and, possibly, inverting through dc-dc converters. Spacecraft
power loads often turn on or off or otherwise vary their power consumption. Transient
behavior within a load may produce noise that the distribution system translates to
other loads, potentially harming working components. In addition, certain spacecraft
loads require a voltage different from the bus voltage. Power converters often connect
loads susceptible to noise or requiring voltage conversion to the distribution system.
These converters typically isolate the load from the noise on the bus and regulate the
power provided to the load against disturbances from the load and the bus. They also
keep load failures from damaging the power-distribution system and provide on-off
control to desired loads. Any dc-dc converter connected to the bus must dampen its
electromagnetic-interference filter to keep step loads from causing excessive ringing.

We need to know the boundaries of the load profile to evaluate its effects on
required bus voltage and frequency. Most spacecraft have demanded low power
(< 2,000 W), so power distribution has relied on a standard, 28 V bus. This standard,
with electronic parts built to match, has limited study of the best bus voltage. As power
systems expand to many kilowatts, the 28 V bus may not work for power distribution
because of losses in cabling and limits on mass. The harness or cabling that intercon-
nects the spacecraft’s subsystems is a large part (10-25%) of the electrical-power
system’s mass. We must keep harnesses as short as possible to reduce voltage drops
and to regulate the bus voltage. Figure 11-12 depicts the relationship between current
and cable mass.

Systems for distributing power on spacecraft have been predominantly dc because
spacecraft generate direct current power. Direct-current systems will dominated
throughout the 1990s. Conversion to ac would require more electronics, which would
add mass to the EPS. Alternating-current power distribution applies only for high-
power spacecraft, such as the International Space Station, which have many electrical
loads with varying duty cycles. Even on the space station, however, recent decisions
have taken planners back to dc for the entire distribution system.

Power distribution systems are either centralized or decentralized, depending on the
location of the converters. The decentralized approach places the converters at each

helps keep this mass low.

load separately, whereas the centralized approach regulates power to all spacecraft
loads within the main bus. The decentralized approach implies an unregulated bus
because distributed converters regulate power. A regulated power bus typically has
some power converters at the load interface because electronics may require different
voltages (+5, +12 Vdc). An advantage of the centralized system is that we do not have
to tailor-design the EPS for different applications. Larger spacecraft with high power
levels use the decentralized distribution systems, with an unregulated bus, usually.

Fault protection within the EPS focuses on detection, isolation, and correction of
faults. Its main purpose is to isolate a failed load that could eventually cause loss of
the mission or the spacecraft. A failed load typically implies a short circuit, which will
draw excessive power. If this condition continues, the failed load may stress cables and
drain the energy-storage reserve. Typically, we would isolate these faults from the
EPS bus with fuses (sometimes resettable). Most spacecraft power loads have some
sort of fuse in series with the power bus to isolate faults. Of course, if the mission
requires us to know where load faults occur, we can add fault-detection circuits. To
design the Power Distribution subsystem, follow the steps in Table 11-41.

11.4.4 Power Regulation and Control

The energy source determines how we regulate a spacecraft’s power. For example,
we regulate a static or dynamic power source through the direct energy transfer
method discussed below. But because most aerospace applications use solar photovol-

taics, we will examine power regulation emphasizing that viewpoint. Power regulation
divides into three main categories: controlling the solar array, regulating bus voltage,
and charging the battery.

We must control electrical power generated at the array to prevent battery over-
charging and undesired spacecraft heating. The two main power control techniques,
illustrated in Fig. 11-13, are a peak-power tracker (PPT) and a direct-energy-transfer
(DET) subsystem. A PPT is a nondissipative subsystem because it extracts the exact
power a spacecraft requires up to the array’s peak power. The DET subsystem is a dis-
sipative subsystem because it dissipates power not used by the loads. However, a DET
subsystem can dissipate this power at the array or through external banks of shunt
resistors to avoid internal power dissipation. DET subsystems commonly use shunt
regulation to maintain the bus voltage at a predetermined level. Figure 11-13 depicts
the main functional differences between varying PPT and shunt-regulated DET sub-
systems.

A PPT is a de-de converter operating in series with the solar array. Thus, it
dynamically changes the operating point of the solar-array source to the voltage side
of the array (Fig. 11-13) and tracks the peak-power point when energy demand
exceeds the peak power. It allows the array voltage to swing up to its maximum power
point; then the converter transforms the input power to an equivalent output power, but
at a different voltage and current. Solar-source characteristics permit us to extract large
amounts of power when the array is cold (post eclipse) and at the beginning of life. A
peak-power tracker replaces the shunt-regulation function by backing off the peak-
power point of the arrays toward the end of the battery’s charging period. Because the
PPT is in series with the array, it uses 4-7% of the total power. A PPT has advantages
for missions under 5 years that require more power at BOL than at EOL.

For direct energy transfer systems a shunt regulator operates in parallel to the array
and shunts the array current (typically at the array) away from the subsystem when the

and load.

loads or battery charging do not need power. Power subsystems with shunt regulation
are extremely efficient. They dissipate little energy by simply shunting excess power
at the array or through shunt resistor banks. A shunt-regulated subsystem has
advantages: fewer parts, lower mass, and higher total efficiency at EOL.

Techniques for controlling bus voltage on electrical-power subsystems fall into
three categories: unregulated, quasi-regulated, or fully regulated. Figure 11-13
illustrates the main differences between these techniques. An unregulated subsystem
has a load bus voltage that varies significantly. The bus-voltage regulation derives
from battery regulation, which varies about 20% from charge to discharge. In an
unregulated subsystem, the load bus voltage is the voltage of the batteries.

Quasi-regulated subsystems regulate the bus voltage during battery charge but not
during battery discharge. A battery charger is in series with each battery or group of
parallel batteries. During charge the bus voltage fixes at a potential several volts above
the batteries. As the batteries reach full charge, the drop across the chargers decreases,

11.4 Power 427

but the bus voltage is still constantly regulated. The bus becomes unregulated during
discharge when the voltage is about a diode drop lower than the batteries and decreases
as the batteries further discharge. A quasi-regulated power subsystem has low effi-
ciency and high electromagnetic interference if used with a peak-power tracker.

The fully regulated power subsystem is inefficient, but it will work on a spacecraft
that requires low power and a highly regulated bus. This subsystem employs charge
and discharge regulators. We can design the regulators so the charge regulator uses lin-
ear technology and the discharge regulator is a switching converter, but for best effi-
ciency both should be converters. The advantage of this type of power subsystem is
that, when we connect it to the loads, the system behaves like a low-impedance power
supply, making design integration a simple task. But it is the most complex type of
power subsystem, with an inherent low efficiency and high electromagnetic
interference when used with a PPT or boost converter.

We can charge batteries individually or in parallel. A parallel charging system is
simpler and has the lower cost, but does not allow flexibility in vehicle integration. It
can also stress batteries so they degrade faster. When batteries are charged in parallel,
the voltage is the same but the current and temperature are not. Because current is not
rigidly controlled, one battery could receive all the available charge current, and.a
thermal runaway condition could result if we do not control the bus voltage from the
hottest battery. Parallel batteries eventually end up balancing out, so we could use
them for missions under five years. To ensure a battery life greater than five years, we
should seriously consider independent chargers, such as the linear, charge-current-
control (LC) design in Fig. 11-13.

Batteries usually limit the life of a spacecraft. To support a seven-year life, we must
charge the batteries independently to degrade the battery as little as possible. Individ-
ual charging optimizes the battery use by charging all the batteries to their own unique
limits. It also forgives battery deviations in systems with several batteries. Unfor-
tunately, individual chargers add impedance, electronic piece parts, and thermal
dissipation not present in a parallel system. To design the Power Regulation and
Control subsystem, follow the steps in Table 11-42.

The role of the thermal control subsystem (TCS) is to maintain all spacecraft and
payload components and subsystems within their required temperature limits for each
mission phase. Temperature limits include a cold temperature which the component
must not go below and a hot temperature that it must not exceed. Two limits are
frequently defined: operational limits that the component must remain within while
operating and survival limits that the component must remain within at all times, even
when not powered. Exceeding survival temperature limits can result in permanent
equipment damage as opposed to out-of-tolerance performance when operational
limits are exceeded. Table 11-43 gives typical component temperature ranges for
representative spacecraft components. Thermal control is also used to ensure that
temperature gradient requirements are met. An example of a gradient requirement is
to ensure that one side of a structure does not get hotter or colder than the opposite side
by more than, say, 30 °C. A larger gradient could cause structural deformation such
that pointing is adversely impacted, possibly permanently.

TABLE 11-43. Examples of Typical Thermal Requirements for Spacecraft Components.
The thermal control subsystem is required to maintain all spacecraft equipment
within proper temperature ranges. Note that the temperature extremes on the
outer portions of spacecraft can vary between + 200 °C.

Thermal control techniques are broadly divided into two categories. Passive
thermal control makes use of materials, coatings, or surface finishes (such as blankets
or second surface mirrors) to maintain temperature limits. Active thermal control,
which is generally more complex and expensive, maintains the temperature by some
active means, such as heaters or thermo-electric coolers. In general, low-cost thermal

control] systems are designed to keep spacecraft at the cool end of allowable tempera-
ture ranges. Cooler components generally last longer, and this allows for system power
growth. Though this can require additional power, it decreases the number of
expensive iterations on the thermal design and analysis (which happens anyway, of
course).

Thermal control is critical to ensuring the performance and survival of spacecraft
and payload equipment. Consider your personal computer, for example. It typically
operates at room temperature plus or minus a few 10’s of degrees. The space environ-
ment can cause equipment to get as hot as 100 °C and as cold as —130 °C with the
changes occurring in 10’s of seconds or minutes. Your cell phone works poorly, if it
works at all, after being kept in your black car during a hot summer afternoon. In this
example, the environment reaches approximately 60° to 65 °C.

Table 11-44 summarizes the design process for the thermal control system. As
always, we begin with the development of requirements and constraints, paying
particular attention to specific equipment or events likely to cause problems, such as
the need for maintaining cryogenic temperatures for a payload instrument or a long
thruster firing that may cause significant radiant heating on nearby surfaces. Step 2 is
to determine the overall thermal environment of the spacecraft, i.e., characterize the
heat inputs throughout the entire life of the mission. The most important external heat
source will nearly always be the Sun, which continuously provides 1367 W/m2 (called
the solar constant) at the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun and which varies as
l/r2 with distance from the Sun. (See Fig. 11-14.) This input goes away whenever the
spacecraft enters a period of eclipse as discussed in Sec. 5.1. However, the Earth or
other nearby central body serves as a moderating thermal influence by radiating heat
in the infrared, corresponding to the blackbody temperature of the central body. (See
Sec. 9.3.1.)

Sun, but we must also include reflected solar energy (albedo) and Earth infrared in
our calculations. The only way a spacecraft can get rid of heat is by radiating it to
space.

In Step 3, we review thermal requirements and constraints, compare them with
actual heat sources and equipment placement, and identify situations where the
maximum and minimum equilibrium temperatures of the equipment are outside the
required limits. For example, challenges arise when we must deal with cryogenic

devices or when required temperature tolerances are very tight. Once we thoroughly
understand the thermal control challenges, we enter Step 4 of the process to develop
thermal designs that can be used to satisfy our requirements. These may range from
applying different paints, multi-layer insulation blankets, and component placement,
to the use of more sophisticated devices like cryogenic cooling systems, heat pipes,
and thermostatically-controlled heaters.

Once we have identified a potential thermal control approach and configuration, we
proceed to Step 5 where we determine the radiator and heater requirements for the
spacecraft and its components. We consider two worst-case conditions: worst-case
hot, where the spacecraft is in the Sun and maximum power is being dissipated, and
worst-case cold, where the spacecraft is in eclipse and dissipating minimum power.
During this step we also try to understand the performance of the thermal control
system over time taking into account degradation of thermal control surfaces and
extraordinary thermal events or circumstances.

In Step 6 we use the information generated previously to estimate the mass and
power of the thermal control system. As usual we document the results (in Step 7) and
repeat the entire process until we create a thermal control system that meets the re-
quirements and constraints at an acceptable mass, cost, and risk.

Each of the steps in this process is discussed in more detail below. For a much more
extensive discussion of the thermal control process for space systems see Gilmore
{2002] or Karam [1998].

11.5.1 Spacecraft Thermal Environment

Spacecraft thermal control is a process of energy management in which the thermal
environment plays a major role. Over the course of the development and operational
life cycle, a spacecraft will be exposed to environments encountered during ground
testing, transportation, launch, orbit transfer, and operational orbits with nominal and
safehold attitudes. During ground operations, convection with ambient air and radiant
heat exchange with surrounding objects are the principal environmental influences.
During launch ascent, radiant heating from the inside surfaces of the booster fairing
and, after the fairing is jettisoned, free-molecular heating due to friction with the
atmosphere are the dominant environmental drivers. Once above the upper reaches of
the atmosphere, direct sunlight, sunlight reflected off of Earth or other planets
(albedo), and infrared (IR) energy emitted from a planet’s atmosphere or surface are
the only significant sources of environmental heat. In most cases, the thermal control
system is designed to maintain all spacecraft components within allowable tempera-
ture limits in the environments encountered on-orbit, while compatibility with ground
operations and launch ascent conditions is assured by controlling the environment or
limiting the spacecraft’s exposure to it.

As illustrated in Fig. 11-15, the overall thermal control of a spacecraft on orbit is
usually achieved by balancing the heat emitted by the spacecraft as IR radiation
against the heat dissipated by its internal components plus the heat absorbed from the
environment; atmospheric convection is absent in space. Because a generic thermal
control system capable of maintaining spacecraft temperatures in all environments
would be prohibitively heavy and expensive, it is generally more cost effective and
practical to custom-tailor a thermal design to each spacecraft and its mission environ-
ment. This means that the thermal design analysis must consider the worst case hot and
cold combinations of waste heat generated by spacecraft components in their various
operating modes and the variable environmental heat loads on the spacecraft.

Direct Solar

Sunlight is the major source of environmental heating on most spacecraft. Fortu-
nately, the Sun is a very stable energy source which is constant to within a fraction of
a percent. However, because the Earth’s orbit is elliptical, the intensity of sunlight
reaching Earth varies approximately + 3.5%, depending on Earth’s distance from the
Sun. At summer solstice, Earth is farthest from the Sun, and the intensity is at a mini-
mum value of 1322 W/m2; at winter solstice, the intensity is at its maximum value of
1414 W/m2. The intensity of sunlight at Earth’s mean distance from the Sun (1 AU) is
known as the solar constant and is equal to 1367 W/m2.

Solar intensity also varies as a function of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 11-15. The
energy distribution is approximately 7% ultraviolet, 46% visible, and 47% near
(short-wavelength) IR. However, the IR energy emitted by the Sun is of a much shorter
wavelength than that emitted by a body near room temperature. This distinction allows
for the selection of thermal-control finishes that are very reflective in the solar spec-
trum but highly emissive to room temperature (long-wavelength) IR, as shown in
Fig. 11-15. These finishes, which will be discussed in more detail later, minimize solar
heat loads while maximizing a spacecraft’s ability to reject waste heat.

line represents the absorptance or emittance of a quartz mirror radiator. The point is
that we can select thermal control coatings that are highly reflective to high energy
inputs like solar energy and highly emissive at room temperatures.

Albedo

Sunlight reflected off a planet or moon is known as albedo. A planet’s albedo is
usually expressed as the fraction of incident sunlight that is reflected back to space and
is highly variable. Usually, reflectivity is greater over land as compared with oceans
and generally increases with decreasing local solar-elevation angles and increasing
cloud coverage. Because of greater snow and ice coverage, decreasing solar elevation
angle, and increasing cloud coverage, albedo also tends to increase with latitude.
These variations make selection of the best albedo value for a particular thermal
analysis rather uncertain, and it is not unusual to find variations throughout the
industry. Representative values for orbits of different inclinations are shown in
Table 11-45A.

11.5 Thermal 433

(Data Courtesy NASA). This table shows the relative nature of Earth-emitted
IR and percent Albedo as a function of orbit inclination. Note that the highest
values of Earth-emitted IR occur at lower inclinations associated with tropical
and desert regions. The value of Earth-emitted IR decreases with increasing
latitude. In general, albedo increases with increasing latitude. -

Earth IR

All incident sunlight not reflected as albedo is absorbed by Earth and eventually
re-emitted as IR energy or blackbody radiation (see Sec. 9.2). While this balance is
maintained fairly well on a global annual average basis, the intensity of IR energy
emitted at any given time from a particular point on Earth can vary considerably de-
pending on factors such as the local temperature of Earth’s surface and the amount of
cloud cover. A warmer surface region will emit more radiation than a colder one.
Generally, highest values of Earth emitted IR will occur in tropical and desert regions
(as these are the regions of the globe receiving the maximum solar heating) and will
decrease with increasing latitude. Cloud cover tends to lower Earth emitted IR because
cloud tops are cold and clouds effectively block up-welling radiation from the Earth’s
warmer surface below. These localized variations in Earth emitted IR, while signifi-
cant, are much less severe than the variations in albedo. Representative orbit-average
values for Earth IR are shown in Table 11-45A.

The IR energy emitted by the Earth, which has an effective average temperature
around —18 °C, is of approximately the same wavelength as that emitted by spacecraft,
that is, it is of much longer wavelength than the energy emitted by the Sun at 5500 °C.
Unlike short-wavelength solar energy, Earth IR loads incident on a spacecraft cannot
be reflected away from radiator surfaces with special thermal-control coatings, since
the same coatings would prevent the radiation of waste heat away from the spacecraft.
Because of this, Earth-emitted IR energy can present a particularly heavy backload on
spacecraft radiators in low-altitude orbits.

Usually the spacecraft is warmer than the effective Earth temperature, and the net
heat transfer is from spacecraft to Earth. However, for analysis, it is convenient to
ignore Earth when calculating radiant heat rejection from the spacecraft to space and
to assume that Earth does not block the view to space. Then the difference in IR energy
is added back in as an “incoming” heat rate called Earth-emitted IR.

Another significant form of environmental heating is known as free molecular
heating (FMH). This is a result of bombardment of the vehicle by individual molecules
in the outer reaches of the atmosphere. For most spacecraft, FMH is only encountered
during launch ascent just after the booster’s payload fairing is ejected. It is desirable
to drop the fairing as soon as possible after launch to minimize the amount of dead
weight the booster must deliver to orbit. The point at which the fairing is separated is

434 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

often determined by a trade-off between the desire to save weight and the need to
protect the spacecraft from excessive atmospheric heating. Some spacecraft also
experience FMH if they have exceptionally low perigee altitudes or use aerobraking
maneuvers that cause them to dip into a planet’s atmosphere. In most cases, FMH
effects can be tolerated by the on-orbit thermal design so that no special thermal design
changes are required to protect the spacecraft from it.

Environment of Interplanetary Missions

Interplanetary trajectories can expose spacecraft to a range of thermal
environments much more severe than those encountered in Earth orbit. During most
of an interplanetary cruise, the only environmental heating comes from direct sunlight,
which falls off as the square of the distance from the Sun. During a flyby, or after a
spacecraft is placed into orbit around a planet, it is also exposed to IR and albedo loads
from the planet.

Planetary and lunar IR and albedo environments are given in Table 11-45B. They
vary widely due to the various planet’s different distances from the Sun and different
atmosphere and surface characteristics. Gilmore [2002] provides a detailed character-
ization of the thermal environments of the planets.

values of albedo and IR emission for the planets of our Solar System. Perihelion

11.5.2 Thermal Control Components

Surface Finishes

In spacecraft thermal designs, wavelength-dependent thermal control coatings are
used for various purposes. Solar reflectors such as second-surface mirrors and white
paints or silver- or aluminum-backed teflon are used to minimize absorbed solar
energy, yet emit energy almost like an ideal blackbody. To minimize both the absorbed
solar energy and infrared emission, polished metal such as aluminum foil or gold plat-
ing is used. On the interior of the vehicle, if it is desired to exchange energy with the
compartment or other equipment, black paint is commonly used. Thus, the existing
state of the art uses a rather wide variety of coatings which have wavelength dependent

11.5 Thermal 435

thermal properties. The problems of in-space stability, outgassing, and mechanical
adhesion to the substrate have been resolved for most coatings. There are many fully
qualified coatings, so development and qualification of a new coating for a new design
is normally unnecessary.

The external surfaces of a spacecraft radiatively couple the spacecraft to space.
Because these surfaces are also exposed to external sources of energy such as sunlight
and Earth-emitted IR, their radiative properties must be selected to achieve an energy
balance at the desired temperature between spacecraft internal dissipation, external
sources of heat, and reradiation to space, as illustrated in Fig. 11-16.

Fig. 11-16. Radiator Energy Balance (no external blockage). Note that we must. select
radiative properties of the spacecraft surface to achieve an energy balance among
spacecraft internal dissipation, external heat sources and reradiation to space to
obtain the desired temperature.

The two primary surface properties of importance are the IR emissivity, €, and the
solar absorptivity, a. Table 11-46 shows the range of properties available for some
common surface finishes. Two or more coatings are sometimes combined in a
checkerboard or striped pattern to obtain the desired combination of average absorp-
tivity and emissivity if it can not be obtained in a single material.

As an example, the average temperature of a sphere at 1 AU from the Sun can be
calculated as follows:

o T4= (a/€) x S x (Ay/A) (11-10)

where o is the Stefan Boltzmann’s constant, 5.670 51 x 10-8 W/m2 K4, A, is the pro-
jected area, A is the total area, and S = 1367 W/m? (the solar constant). For a sphere,
AJA = 712/ 472 =0.25. If the sphere is painted with Z93 white, a@/€=0.17/ 0.92 and
T =-90 °C. For a sphere painted with Z306 black, a /e = 0.92 / 0.89 and T= 8 °C.
Thermal control finishes are affected in orbit by charged particles, ultraviolet
radiation, high vacuum, and the contaminant films that deposit out on almost all space-
craft surfaces. The general result of these processes is an increase in solar absorptivity
with little or no effect on infrared emissivity. This is normally undesirable from a

436 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

TABLE 11-46. Properties of Common Finishes. The absorptivity and emissivity of typical
spacecraft finishes are shown here. Note that a combination of finishes can be
made to create the desired absorptivity to emissivity ratios.

thermal control standpoint because spacecraft radiators must be sized to account for
the substantial increase in absorbed solar energy that occurs due to degradation over
the mission. These radiators, which are oversized to handle the high solar loads at
“end-of-life,” cause the spacecraft to run much cooler in the early years of the mission,
sometimes necessitating the use of heaters to avoid under-temperatures of electronic
components. The degradation is, therefore, a problem not only because of the solar
load, but also because of the change in load over the course of the mission. The stabil-
ity of coating properties is important in order to both limit maximum temperatures and
minimize heater-power requirements.

Insulation

Multilayer insulation (MLI) and single-layer radiation shields are among the most
common thermal control elements on spacecraft. MLI blankets are used either to
prevent excessive heat loss from a component or excessive heating from environ-
mental fluxes or rocket plumes. Most spacecraft are covered with MLI blankets, with

11.5 Thermal 437

cut-outs provided for radiator areas to reject internally generated waste heat. MLI
blankets are also typically used to protect internal propellant tanks, propellant lines,
solid rocket motors, and cryogenic dewars. Single-layer radiation barriers are some-
times used in place of MLI where a lesser degree of thermal isolation is required, since
they are lighter and cheaper to manufacture. For applications requiring insulation
under atmospheric conditions, foam, batt, and aerogel materials are generally used
because MLI is not very effective in the presence of a gas.

Multilayer insulation is composed of multiple layers of low-emittance films with
low conductivity between layers, as shown in Fig. 11-17A. The simplest construction
is a layered blanket assembled from embossed, thin mylar sheets (1/4 mil thick) with
a vacuum-deposited aluminum finish on one side of each sheet. The embossing results
in the sheets touching only at a few points, thereby minimizing conductive heat paths
between layers. The layers are aluminized on one side only, so that the mylar can act
as a low-conductivity spacer. Higher-performance construction uses mylar film
metallized on both surfaces (aluminum or gold) with silk or dacron net, Tissuglas
paper, or “Super-Flock” whiskers as the low-conductance spacers. Testing done at JPL
showed that replacing the flat aluminized mylar/dacron spacers with embossed
aluminized Kapton and no spacers decreased the effectiveness of the blankets tested
by 19% [Lin, Stultz, Reeve, 1995].

Figure 11-17B illustrates theoretical and experimental data for embossed alumi-
nized (one surface) mylar insulation versus number of insulation-blanket layers. The
emittance for a multilayer blanket theoretically varies inversely with one over one plus
the number of layers. However, in practice, simply increasing the number of layers
past a certain value will not improve performance. As the number of layers increases,
radiative heat transfer becomes small compared to conductive “shorts” between layers
and other losses. Thus, a point of diminishing returns is reached. Considering these
trends, about 25 layers are usually sufficient to obtain a minimum overall conductance
value.

In well-controlled laboratory tests, it is possible to achieve values of 0.005 or lower
for the effective emittance, &*. However, when a blanket is configured for spacecraft
application, experience has shown that an €* of 0.015 to 0.030 is typical for medium-
sized area applications. As the size of the application increases, the relative perfor-
mance generally increases. This results from the smaller relative influences of heat

leaks due to edge effects, seams, or cable penetrations. For very-large-area applica-
tions with minimal penetrations, the €* laboratory performance approaches 0.005 at
30 layers. Performance data from cryogenic tankage and controlled calorimeter tests
typically show performance of €* down to 0.002. Control of discontinuities through
the design and fabrication of insulation joints and penetration is crucial to the problem
of reducing the effective emittance of multilayer blankets. Small area blankets show
high effective emittance along with considerable manufacturing variation. Very small
blankets used to wrap propellant lines typically have effective emittances ranging
from 0.05 to 0.30, making low emittance surface finishes a simpler and equally effec-
tive alternative for internal propellant lines. External lines that are exposed to sunlight
may still require MLI blankets, however, to avoid overheating that might be caused by
the high absorptance/emittance ratios typical of low emittance surface finishes.

Missions involving planetary landers, rovers, or atmospheric probes usually require
insulation that performs well in the presence of an atmosphere. While MLI may still
be required to protect the hardware during interplanetary cruise, foam, batt, or aerogel
materials are generally added to provide insulation after atmospheric entry and landing
in situations where ambient pressure is expected to be high enough to substantially
degrade MLI performance. If atmospheric pressure and gravity are low enough,
simple trapped gas spaces alone may be sufficient to limit heat loss to the surround-
ings. The underlying principle behind all of these insulation types is to trap gas within
volumes small enough to eliminate convection effects. Total heat transfer is thereby
limited to what can conduct through the low conductivity insulation material and gas
and radiate across the insulation through a process of multiple absorptions and
emissions within the insulation material structure. To complicate MLI design further
each layer must be grounded to reduce the chance of electrostatic discharge.

11.5 Thermal 439

Radiators

Most spacecraft waste heat is rejected to space by radiators. These occur in several
different forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the
side of the spacecraft, or panels that are deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit.
Whatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by IR radiation from their
surfaces. The radiating power is dependent on the emissivity of the surface and its
temperature. The radiator must reject both the satellite waste heat plus any radiant-heat
loads from the environment or other spacecraft surfaces that are absorbed by the radi-
ator, as shown in Fig. 11-16. Most radiators are therefore given surface finishes with
high IR emissivity (> 0.8) to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptivity (< 0.2)
to limit heat loads from the Sun. Typical finishes include quartz mirrors, silvered or
aluminized teflon, and white paint.

The radiating power of a radiator is a strong function of temperature. The total heat
leaving a radiator surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation: (See Sec. 9.2.)

OQ = eo AT4 (11-11)

where A is the surface area, € is emissivity, T is the absolute temperature, and ois the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.670 51 x 10-8 W/m2 K4).

The T4 term results in a large increase in radiating capability with temperature, as
shown in Fig. 11-18. The radiating power at 50 °C is about twice that at 0 °C. At cryo-
genic temperatures the effect is even more pronounced, with a 70 °K” radiator having
only 1/300th the heat rejection capability of a room-temperature radiator. This makes
cryogenic radiators extremely sensitive to environmental heating and heat leaks
through insulation and supports, and leads to special design considerations.

Fig. 11-18. Blackbody Radiator Heat Rejection. Heat rejection or heat radiating capability
increases with temperature. For example, the radiating capability at 50 °C is about
twice that of a surface at 0 °C.

*The metric unit of temperature is the Kelvin, K, which is measured in the same units as the
Celsius scale, °C, but starts at absolute zero. By definition, 0 °C = 273.15 K. In correct metric
usage, the word “degree” is used with the Celsius scale, but not with the Kelvin scale. For
example, “0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin” is correct, while “O degrees Celsius equals
273.15 degrees Kelvin” is incorrect. Unfortunately, K is widely used in astronautics both for
1024 in computer systems analysis and for $1000 in cost analysis. (Of course, k is the metric
prefix for 1000.) To avoid confusion, we use °K and °C throughout. However, many of the
references correctly omit the “°” symbol when using the Kelvin scale.

Most spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 watts of spacecraft internally
generated electronics waste heat per square meter. The upper end of this range is
typical of a radiator that runs at a fairly high temperature (say 40 °C) and experiences
relatively modest heat backload from the environment or other spacecraft surfaces.
The lower end of the range represents a radiator running below room temperature in
low-Earth orbit, where environmental backloads can be substantial. The actual sizing
is determined by a thermal analysis that considers the desired operating temperature,
worst-case Satellite waste heat, environmental heating, and radiative and conductive
interactions with other spacecraft surfaces. Weights allocated for radiators typically
vary from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around
12 kg/m2 for a heavy deployable radiator and its support and deployment structure.

Heaters

Ideally, thermal control of a satellite or component would be achieved using only
passive techniques, such as surface finishes. Unfortunately, orbital and seasonal vari-
ations in environment and component heat-generation rates, along with degradations
of surface finishes over time, can drive temperature variations in a passive design to
ranges larger than some components can withstand. Because of this, heaters are
sometimes required to protect components from cold-case environmental conditions
or to make up for heat that is not dissipated when an electronic box is turned off.
Heaters may also be used with thermostats or solid-state controllers to provide
precise temperature control of a particular component. A third common use for heaters
is to warm components to their minimum operating temperatures before they are
turned on.

The most common type of heater used on spacecraft is the patch heater, several of
which are shown in Fig. 11-19A. It consists of an electrical resistance element
sandwiched between two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material, such as
Kapton. The patch may have one circuit, or more than one, depending on whether
redundancy is required within the patch. Redundancy is generally required on space-
craft systems since heater circuits can fail. Sometimes the redundancy is provided
within the patch and sometimes it is provided by using two separate patches. The patch
heaters shown in the figure illustrate the custom shapes to which these heaters may be
made. In most instances, however, a simple rectangular patch of some standard dimen-
sion is used.

(A) Patch Heaters (B) Cartridge Heater

Fig. 11-19. Types of Heaters. Patch and cartridge heaters are used on many spacecraft to meet
the heating needs of different types of equipment. These heaters are very important
to the successful operation of key components, so we often use redundancy to
increase reliability of these devices.

A cartridge heater is another type that is often used to heat blocks of material or
high-temperature components such as hydrazine-thruster catalyst beds. Such a heater

11.5 Thermal 441

is shown in Fig. 11-19B and consists of a wound resistor enclosed in a cylindrical
metallic case. A hole is typically drilled in the component to be heated and the
cartridge potted into the hole. Another attachment technique involves the use of a
clamp or small bracket to hold the heater. These heaters are typically a quarter inch
diameter or less and up to a few inches long.

Almost all heater systems have some sort of switch or control. This typically
involves a relay that is commandable from the ground to enable or disable power to
the heater, a fuse to protect the spacecraft from a short circuit, and, most commonly, a
thermostat or solid-state controller to turn the heater on and off at predetermined
temperatures. More sophisticated satellites sometimes use their on-board computer to
monitor temperatures and turn heaters on and off as appropriate using relays.

The simplest arrangement involves only the heater, a fuse, and a ground com-
mandable relay to turn the heater on and off. This arrangement is typically used for
heaters that are activated only for special events, or for heaters that can be left on all
the time. A typical application is heating up the catalyst beds on hydrazine thrusters to
100 °C before the thruster is fired. (Firing the thruster with a low initial catalyst-bed
temperature decreases the catalyst life.) The heater is commanded on, the catalyst-bed
is heated, the thruster is fired, and the heater is turned off until the next maneuver, all
under ground control.

Fig. 11-20. Common Control Devices. Mechanical thermostats are typically used to control the
operation of heaters on a spacecraft. Mechanical thermostats are fairly reliable but
typically we have a large number of them on a spacecraft (up to several hundred on
some spacecraft) consequently we see occasional on-orbit failures. Because of this
and increasing spacecraft life requirements, solid state controllers are becoming
more common.

Historically, the most common control device is a mechanical thermostat, such as
the one shown in Fig. 11-20A. These typically consist of a small hermetically sealed
can containing a switch driven by a snap-action bimetallic actuator. The temperature
at which the thermostat clicks on, known as its set point, is fixed for any given
thermostat. The engineer can select from an array of standard thermostats available
from the manufacturer to get a set point close to what is desired, or a custom device
can be ordered. In addition to the set point, the dead band, or the difference between
the temperatures at which the thermostat turns on and turns off, is important. A smaller
dead band reduces the temperature swing of the device being heated and reduces
power consumption a little (since the average temperature is lower). On the other hand,
the smaller dead band also increases the number of cycles on the thermostat itself and

442 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

decreases its reliability. In any event, dead bands less than 4 °C are not recommended
due to problems that have occurred in the past. Small dead bands have been known to
increase the chance of “dithering,” in which the thermostat rapidly cycles on and off.
This is a failure condition that can cause the set point to drift lower, resulting in an
undertemperature of the component being controlled.

Even though thermostats are fairly reliable, the large number of them that may be
present on a typical spacecraft (up to several hundred) results in occasional on-orbit
failures. Because of this, and increasing spacecraft life requirements, solid-state
controllers are becoming more common. Such a controller, an example of which is
shown in Fig. 11-20B, replaces the mechanical switch with an electronic device that
has a higher reliability and life expectancy. These are used extensively on the DMSP,
the Space Telescope, and the ISS. They employ a temperature sensor that can be
located either at the controller or at a remote location, as desired. Another advantage
of solid-state controllers is that extremely tight dead bands (< 0.1 °C) are possible for
very precise temperature control, such as required on the Space Telescope. Optical
systems, some sensors, and electronic frequency standards often require precise
temperature control, which cannot be achieved with a mechanical thermostat.

A number of military and scientific satellites have started to use on-board com-
puters to control heaters. Such systems read the temperatures from telemetry sensors
placed throughout the vehicle and send signals to turn relay-controlled heaters on and
off as required. This allows enormous flexibility since the control set points and dead
bands can be adjusted on orbit by uplinking new tables to the spacecraft computer.

Louvers

Louvers are active thermal control elements that have been used in different forms
on numerous spacecraft. While most commonly placed over external radiators, louvers
may also be used to modulate radiant heat transfer between internal spacecraft
surfaces, or from internal surfaces directly to space through openings in the spacecraft
wall. In general, a louver in its fully open state allows the rejection of six times as
much heat as it does in the fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. Thus
louvers find application where internal power dissipation varies widely as a result of
equipment duty cycles.

louvers are the “venetian-blind” type that are typically opened to allow heat to radiate
away from the spacecraft and closed to keep heat from escaping.

11.5 Thermal 443

The most commonly used louver assembly is the “venetian-blind” type shown in
Fig. 11-21. These louvers consist of four main elements: blades, actuators, sensing
elements, and structural elements. The louver is placed over a high emittance, low
absorptance spacecraft radiator to modulate the flow of radiant heat from that surface.
Blades, which are driven by the actuators, are the louver elements that give variable-
radiation characteristics to the radiator surface below. While closed, louvers shield the
radiator’s view to space, but while open, they allow radiative coupling to space. The
radiating characteristics of the radiator can be varied over the range defined by these
two extreme positions

The actuators drive the blades according to the perceived radiator temperature. In
most louver designs, a bimetallic spiral spring drives each louver blade independently
to ensure maximum reliability. Thus a single point failure is associated with one blade,
not the entire assembly. The actuator spring drives the blade angle as determined by
the underlying radiator temperature. A strong conductive path between the actua-
tor and radiator is therefore sought to minimize the temperature gradient between
them.

Louver assemblies have been designed for operation in both shadow and sunlight.
Two design approaches that have been followed for operation in sunlight are the use
of a Sun shield to prevent direct solar illumination of the louver or the modification
of the louver assembly for high temperature operation if it is directly exposed to
sunlight. Characteristics of louvers offered by the principal vendors are shown in
Table 11-47A.

The effective emittance for some representative louvered-radiator designs are
shown in Table 11-47B. Note that the emittance range for the MMS Landsat-4 design
that uses a sunshield is considerably less than the other designs that do not have
sunshields. The apparent emissivity advantage of the unshielded designs, however, is
at least partly counteracted by the fact that the unshielded louvers will trap sunlight
between the open blades, which adds an additional heat load that must be rejected. The
choice of a shielded or unshielded design for any particular radiator will depend on the
results of the analyses that show the relative performance of each option given the
solar illumination profile for that particular radiator.

Heat Pipes

A heat pipe uses a closed two-phase fluid-flow cycle to transport large quantities
of heat from one location to another without the use of electrical power. The heat pipe
can be used to create isothermal surfaces or to spread out heat from a localized source
uniformly over a larger area. One-way (diode) heat pipes have been tested and flown,
as have variable-conductance heat pipes, which maintain a constant temperature
under varying heat load conditions. Since the driving mechanism is capillary pumping,
a relatively weak force, traditional heat pipes may be susceptible to severe per-
formance degradation when operating under gravity or acceleration, so planning is
needed to facilitate ground testing. Loop heat pipes and capillary pumped loops are
more advanced cousins of the basic heat pipes that can provide constant temperature
operation with varying heat loads under gravity or acceleration.

To illustrate how a heat pipe works, consider a simple horizontal heat pipe in
equilibrium with an isothermal environment, as shown in Fig. 11-22A. The liquid in
the wick and the vapor in the vapor space are at saturation. If heat is applied to the
evaporator, raising its temperature, liquid in the wick evaporates (removing some of
the added heat), which depresses the meniscus in the evaporator since less liquid is
present there. This process also raises the local vapor pressure, since it must be in
saturation with the heated liquid in the wick.

The difference between the increased curvature of the meniscus in the evaporator
wick and the unchanged meniscus in the condenser wick causes a difference in capil-

lary pressure sufficient to pull liquid from the condenser wick toward the evaporator.
This replenishes the liquid in the evaporator wick. At the same time, heated vapor
flows from the evaporator to the condenser, which is at a lower pressure. When this
vapor comes in contact with cooler condenser surfaces, it condenses. This cycle is
shown schematically in Fig. 11-22A.

Elements of this most basic, constant-conductance, heat pipe consist of a working
fluid, a wick structure, and an envelope. The most common wick envelope design
consists of axial grooves in the wall of extruded aluminum tubing, as shown in
Fig. 11-22B. This class of wick is very susceptible to gravity effects during ground
testing, but is relatively inexpensive to produce and very consistent. Heat-transfer
capability is moderate, but sufficient for many applications. Grooves are typically
rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, but more complex shapes such as the “teardrop”
or “keyhole” have been extruded with difficulty. Different working fluids can be used
depending on the temperature range of interest. In most spacecraft applications,
ammonia is the working fluid of choice. Laptop computers, on the other hand, typi-
cally use water in heat pipes used to cool high-power chips.

design which consists of axial grooves in the wall of extruded aluminum tubing.

The most obvious application of a heat pipe is one requiring physical separation of
the heat source and sink. If a heat pipe is used, it is not necessary to mount all hardware
to be cooled directly on radiator panels, or to use relatively inefficient conductive
couplings. A closely-related class of application is that of the thermal transformer. A
small high-powered box can be mounted on one side of a radiator with integral heat
pipes; the heat generated will be spread out over a large radiator surface. This approach
also permits more efficient use of available “real estate’—the area available for a
radiator is seldom centered symmetrically about the heat source, facing the optimal
direction.

446 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

Heat pipes have also been used to reduce temperature gradients in structures to min-
imize thermal distortion. The telescope tube of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory
had three ring-shaped heat pipes to minimize circumferential temperature gradients.
The ammonia/aluminum heat pipes worked throughout the eight years of mission life.

The diode heat pipe was first proposed as a means of connecting a device to two
radiator panels on opposite sides of a spacecraft, with the understanding that at least
one of the radiators would be free of any direct solar load at all times during the orbit.
The diodes would couple the device to the cold radiator, while preventing heat from
leaking back into the system from the radiator in the Sun. This type of thermal design
problem—in which heat from a temporarily warm radiator or from a failed refrigerator
must be kept from leaking back into the system—is an obvious application for a diode
heat pipe.

The variable-conductance heat pipe can be used to control the amount of active
radiator area, providing reasonably good temperature control without the use of
heaters. This is particularly attractive if electrical power is limited, and this type of
design has been flown on a number of satellites. However, if the application requires
maintaining a component at virtually a constant temperature, feedback control (at the
expense of some heater power) may be employed. A sensor on the baseplate of the
device to be controlled can be routed to an on-board computer, and whenever the
temperature drops below the desirable range, heaters on the variable conductance heat
pipe reservoirs are activated, causing the control gas to expand and block off more of
the radiator area. If the temperature rises above the range desired, power to the
reservoir heaters is reduced, increasing the active radiator area. This concept usu-
ally requires less power than using heaters directly on the box or system to be
controlled.

11.5.3 The Thermal Design and Development Process

The first step in the thermal design development process is to make an assessment
of the mission and hardware requirements that will drive the design. This process
begins with reviewing the top-level requirements. As illustrated in Fig. 11-23, these
imposed requirements tend to be very general statements such as: “maintain all com-
ponents within allowable temperature ranges under all mission and test conditions”;
“be compatible with the mission lifetime”; or “provide adequate margin”. From these
general, often vague, requirements, we must derive more specific requirements that
will be useful in developing the thermal design. Examples of these derived
requirements include:

* Temperature limits and reliability requirements for each component
¢ Equipment power dissipations and operating modes

¢ Range of mission orbit parameters

* Operational satellite attitudes

* Attitudes during stressed or failure modes

¢ Launch phase configurations and attitudes

* Ground cooling needs

* Autonomy requirements

* Thermal-distortion budgets

¢ Launch-system interfaces

11.5 Thermal 447

¢ Interfaces with other subsystems, such as

~ Payloads — Structures
— Propulsion — Telemetry, tracking, and command
— Attitude control — Computer and data handling

— Electrical power
¢ Contamination control

¢ Special thermal control requirements for components such as batteries, crystal
oscillators, and sensors.

Once specific design requirements have been identified, the thermal design
development process illustrated in Fig. 11-23A begins. This process is a combination
of design selection and supporting analysis. The selection of a viable thermal design
approach may become almost intuitive for an experienced thermal engineer. Detailed
thermal analyses are, however, always required to verify and refine the design. Expe-
rience can minimizes the number of time-consuming analysis iterations required to
close in on a final design.

Establishing a preliminary thermal design for the spacecraft is usually a two-part
process. The first is to select a thermal design for the body, or basic enclosures of the
spacecraft, that will serve as a thermal sink for all of the internal components. The
second step is to select thermal designs for various components located both within
and outside of the spacecraft body.

As shown in Fig. 11-23B, we begin by assuming that a passive design will
successfully meet all thermal control requirements. As discussed earlier, a wide range
of thermal control hardware and techniques are available to achieve thermal control,
from simple surface finishes to complex heat transfer and refrigeration systems. The
spacecraft system requirements to minimize weight, cost, and test complexity while
maximizing reliability are usually served best by keeping the thermal design as simple
as possible and by avoiding the use of active components. A design that relies only on
surface finishes and insulation blankets will be lighter, far less expensive to build,
more reliable, and easier to test than a design involving heat pipes, louvers, or refrig-
erators. Therefore, although active components will sometimes be required, they
should be used only when necessary.

Most three-axis stabilized spacecraft use the same basic approach to thermal
control of the spacecraft body, e.g., insulating the spacecraft from the space environ-
ment with multi-layer insulation blankets and providing radiator areas with low solar
absorptance and high infrared emittance to reject waste heat. High-power components
are usually mounted on the walls of the vehicle, which provides them with a direct
conduction path to the radiating surfaces on the outside. If component powers are high
enough, conductive doublers or heat pipes may be required to spread heat out over a
wider area so that it can be radiated away at a reasonable temperature. Components
mounted on shelves, panels, and structures internal to the vehicle radiate their waste
heat to the outside walls of the spacecraft, where the heat is rejected to space. The over-
all thermal balance of such a spacecraft is shown in Fig. 11-24.

While an initial design is usually specified through a combination of experience
and simple hand calculations, a thermal analysis of the design in the principal mission
thermal environments must be performed to determine if all temperature control
requirements can be met. We do this by constructing analytical models, which consist
of a geometric math model for calculating radiation interchange factors, and a thermal

math model for predicting temperatures. The geometric model is a mathematical
representation of the physical surfaces of the satellite or component and is used to
calculate the radiation couplings between all surfaces in the model, as well as heating
rates to each surface from external flux sources such as solar, Earth IR, and albedo
radiation. The thermal model is usually a lumped-parameter representation of the
thermal capacitance of each node and thermal conduction terms between nodes, and is
directly analogous to an electrical RC network. These models are constructed using a
combination of computer-aided design technologies and hand calculations.

required to determine what exactly is the worst-case combination of factors, such as
orbit Sun angle, operating mode, vehicle attitude, or surface properties. A number of
parametric runs may also be required to close-in on optimum sizing of radiators. If the
purely passive design is found to be inadequate, we repeat the process using thermal
control hardware elements that are increasingly active in nature, as illustrated in
Fig. 11-23B. Once a satisfactory design is found, estimates of thermal control
subsystem weight and power are made and each thermal control hardware element is
specified in detail.

11.5.4 Thermal Control Challenges

The simplest thermal control scenario is to mount dissipative components directly
on the inner surface of the spacecraft external structural panels. Some, or all, of the
external surface of the panel is used to radiate the heat load to space. Local heat loads
into the panel are spread over the panel area via conduction through the panel. In
higher heat flux situations, thicker facesheets or doubler plates may be needed. In ex-
treme cases, heat pipes can be used to spread the heat load and isothermalize the
radiator or maximize radiator efficiency.

As spacecraft pack density increases, eventually not all components can be
mounted to these panels and some will need to be located internally, away from the
radiator panels. For lower power boxes, a radiative view to the spacecraft core or
external radiators may provide sufficient heat transfer to maintain operating tempera-
tures. In more extreme cases, efficient heat transport devices, such as heat pipes, will
be needed to maintain operational temperatures of these components.

As design complexity and performance levels increase, special thermal situations
often occur in the design of spacecraft and instruments. Typical thermal challenges
that may present themselves include:

* Batteries typically require cooler operating temperatures and smaller
temperature ranges than electronic components. For example, nickel-
hydrogen batteries require minimal temperature differences between each cell

11.5

Thermal 451

and also within the cell for efficient charging, which leads to symmetric cell
packaging. The heater control approach usually necessitates electronic
controllers to minimize cell-to-cell temperature differences.

External Mechanisms are located outside of the spacecraft where thermal
environments are much more extreme. Careful consideration must be given to
understanding the hot and cold scenarios.

Optical Elements generally don’t like large cold temperature excursions due
to coefficient of expansion mismatch between the optical element glass and the
mounting substrate. For a complicated optical system, with numerous optical
surfaces distributed over an optical bench, bulk temperature control of the
bench may be necessary to maintain end-to-end alignment of the optical path.
Cold conditions may over-stress the mounting system due to coefficient of
expansion mismatch between the optic and mounting surface leading to
cracked optics. In addition, any optical bench (instrument or spacecraft)
generally requires thermal isolation from components mounted to it to mini-
mize thermal distortion.

Lasers are typically a large heat source, requiring stable temperature control
that may need to be temperature tuned to the flight models, so adjustable con-
trol should be utilized. This could require electronic controllers.

Some components, most usually IR detectors, operate at very cold temperatures
(125 °K and below) and require special cooling systems to achieve this. Advanced
thermal technologies that can be incorporated in these scenarios, include louver
systems, constant and variable conductance heat pipes, phase change materials, capil-
lary loops, and loop heat pipes. Each of these technologies is explained in Sec. 11.5.2.
Cryogenic cooling can be accomplished by several methods:

* Passive Radiators ate based on the normal principle of radiative heat rejection

to space; however, they must be shielded from even small environmental heat
loads, like Earth albedo and planetary IR, to be effective. Still, they are limited
to the upper cryogenic range. Material selection is critical to prevent parasitic
heat leaks via conduction. Multiple stage radiators remove these parasitic heat
inputs and the final, coldest stage provides the actual sink for the detector.

Stored Cryogens are a passive, expendable fluid or gas is used to absorb waste
heat, usually from IR detectors. These systems are relatively cheap and reli-
able, however, usually only viable for short or infrequent usage due to mass
and volume constraints in packaging the cryogen.

Refrigerator Systems are active systems that use electrical power to remove
heat over long durations. Vibration, cooling, and longevity issues must be
addressed with these systems.

Many times, the packaging of a particular electronics component yields a relatively
high power per unit area of the component’s footprint dimensions, thus limiting the
transfer of the heat into the radiator panel. During the radiator area assessment in the
hot scenario, if the required area is somewhat greater than the footprint dimensions,
the heat can be spread over the required area if the panel facesheet is locally thickened

452 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

under the component. In extreme situations, the required thickness may increase to a
point where a better spreading device is needed to minimize mass impact. Heat pipes
are typically used in this situation where their large heat transport capability can
readily spread the heat from a large local heat source over a larger area of radiator
panel. A drawback to these devices is that they must be arranged to allow operation
during ground testing. This usually requires them to be level, or a slightly adverse tilt
(evaporator < 0,02 cm above condenser) due to their low pumping pressure from small
differences in capillary forces inside the pipe. In certain situations, a pipe that is
vertical in ground testing can still be utilized, although the heat transfer capacity will
be significantly reduced. These are considered passive devices since no feedback
control is needed. However, it must be understood that they will operate in the
cold scenario as well, resulting in more heater power to maintain component
temperatures.

11.5.5 Heat Balance Estimation

A successful thermal design must include adequate radiator area to accommodate
the maximum operational power during the hottest operational environment without
exceeding allowable temperatures. Heater power may be required to maintain mini-
mum allowable temperatures during nominal operations, especially for propulsion
components and batteries. Most spacecraft also require “survival” heaters to survive
potential reduced-power conditions, although component temperature allowables may
be much lower than in operational cases. Over the lifetime of a typical mission, varia-
tions in thermal environments and internal power dissipation combined with degrada-
tion of material properties can result in a large number of possible thermal scenarios.
Early in the conceptual design phase, it is essential that the hot and cold extremes of
these scenarios be identified, including variations in the operating condition of the
spacecraft.

Thermal environments depend on orbital characteristics, attitude profiles, and
spacecraft configuration. The typical range of operating environments can be grouped
as follows:

¢ Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) missions are usually between 400 and 800 km
altitude. Low-inclination orbits at these altitudes have eclipse periods that are
fairly consistent over the life of the mission. Most Sun-synchronous missions
have fairly constant eclipse periods and a smaller range of Sun angles to
contend with, and have a “cold side” of the spacecraft that is never in direct
sunlight. High inclination, non-synchronous missions have a full range of Sun
angles, and may have weeks or months with no eclipses. Albedo and Earth
infrared inputs (see Table 11-45A and Sec. 11.5.1) are significant contributors
to energy balance for LEO satellites.

* Geostationary (GEO) missions generally maintain constant attitude for
observation or communication. The + 23.5° angular north-south motion of the
Sun during the year results in some solar input on the north and south facing
sides of the spacecraft, except during the equinoxes. Equinox is normally the
cold scenario for such a mission, with an eclipse season of about 3 weeks with
daily eclipses up to 72 minutes, and minimal solar flux on the north and south
sides during daylight. Usually, the other four sides (Earth, zenith, east, and
west) experience 12 consecutive hours of Sun per 24-hour orbit, and would be
much less efficient radiator surfaces due to this variability. While on station,

11.5 Thermal 453

albedo and Earth infrared radiation amount to about 1% of low-Earth orbit
values, so they can be neglected for most applications.

¢ High Earth Orbits can be highly eccentric with perigee as low as a few
hundred kilometers, but the apogee may be many thousands of kilometers.
Thermal environments vary accordingly; at perigee, the albedo and IR are
greatest, and at apogee, only direct solar is significant for most cases. If cryo-
genic systems are employed, the small Earth induced heating contributions
must be assessed.

¢ Interplanetary Missions can have considerable variation in solar flux, which
varies inversely with the square of the distance from the Sun. For example, the
Cassini mission to Saturn had a Venus flyby, so its solar constant varied from
about 2700 W/m? at Venus to 15 W/m? at Saturn. Decreasing solar intensity
presents a huge challenge for missions to the outer planets, requiring alterna-
tive means of spacecraft power generation that constrain available heater
power as environments get colder. Missions to Jupiter and beyond typically
employ radioactive power sources, so their waste heat must be distributed
around the satellite by the thermal subsystem. Orbiting a planet presents
further complications, in that each planet has its own albedo and infrared
radiation characteristics as listed in Table 11-45B.

Radiator Requirements

For most spacecraft, heat balance on radiators is the dominant factor in the thermal
design. Radiator location and coatings can be controlled, and MLI blankets are used
to mimimize heat inputs and outputs for other surfaces. Since the maximum available
radiator area is constrained by the structural size of the spacecraft, hot case scenarios
must be assessed to ensure that sufficient radiator area is available to maintain accept-
able temperatures. The first calculations should assess the amount of radiator area
needed to reject the maximum operational heat load while maintaining gradients and
component temperatures within their allowable operational mode range (including
margin) in the hottest environmental conditions. Sometimes, radiator requirements
exceed the available spacecraft surface area. Extended radiators (including deploy-
ables) may be used, but they come with a mass penalty since they must be structurally
supported and thermally coupled to the spacecraft.

For simplicity, most mission scenarios are initially assumed to be a steady-state
energy balance. Balance is achieved when all of the heat sources on a spacecraft are
equal to the heat lost to space. Heat sources include external environmental inputs and
internal heat generation, while the most significant heat losses are usually the
controlled heat rejection from the radiators and heat leaks from MLI insulation and
exposed structures. The heat balance for a typical spacecraft can be estimated as
follows.

From a generalized heat balance equation:

Qexternal +Q internal = Qradiator + Qu (11-13)

where Qvxternaj iS the environmental heat absorbed, Qinjerngi iS the power dissipation,
Q,adiator 18 the heat rejected from the spacecraft primary radiator surfaces, and Qyj77
is the heat lost from blankets and elsewhere on the spacecraft

454 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

To simplify the hot case calculation, we assume (conservatively) that the net Qyyr7
is negligible, so Qeyterngi becomes the flux absorbed by the radiators only. For an
individual radiator:

Qinternal + Qexternal = Q,adiator (11-14)

Substituting Eq. (11-11) for Qyagiator ANd Gexternat A for Qexternai the radiator heat
balance becomes:

Qinternal + external A = € o AT4 (11-15)

where Qinternal 18 the internal spacecraft heat, q.yernqj iS the external environmental
heat load on the radiator per unit area, A is the area, € is the radiator emittance, O is
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.670 51 x 10-8 W/m?K®4), and T is the radiator
temperature.

The external environmental load, qeyernq, can be broken down into the following
individual heat loads:

external = Usolar + Valbedo + WEarthIR * Ubackload (11-16)

where soiar is the absorbed solar load per unit area, qgj,¢gq 18 the absorbed heat load
per unit area, Gyg,4,7r is the absorbed Earth IR heat load per unit area, and Qpactigad iS
the radiative heat load from external spacecraft surfaces (solar arrays, antennas) that
is absorbed on the radiator.

To size a radiator, one must calculate a value for each of the terms in Eq. (11-16).
The solar term, qs gr, can be calculated as discussed in Sec. 5.1 and will not be repeat-
ed here. Earth IR and albedo loads per unit area, qrarth rp ANd Ggjpego, can be calculated
using the following:

Qearthir = € TerrFEIR (11-17)
albedo = © lsotar Patbedo Fatbedo (11-18)

where and € are the absorptivity and emissivity of the radiator, Ipyp and I,,), are the
intensity of the Earth IR and solar fluxes, and Pyjpedgo iS the Earth’s albedo. Suggested
hot and cold case values for these parameters are shown in Table 11-48A. The remain-
ing terms, Feyp and Fajpedo, are geometrical factors that account for the direction of the
radiator relative to the Earth and Sun. (See Appendix D.2) Calculating the radiative
backload from other spacecraft surfaces, qpackioads Tequires geometric modeling of the
spacecraft that is beyond the scope of this discussion. Generally speaking, however, if
the view that a surface has to space is blocked to a substantial degree by views to other
spacecraft surfaces, this backload term can be so large as to make the surface useless
as a radiator. For this reason, radiators are usually located on surfaces that have a
reasonably clear view to space.

Obviously, the most efficient radiator surfaces are those that minimize the external
loads represented by the constituent terms of q,,rernqj- Radiator coatings are therefore
critical to the thermal design; coatings with low solar absorptance minimize Sun and
albedo input, and a high emittance is required to maximize radiation to space.
Backload on the radiator can be minimized by relative location of radiators and
external components, especially solar arrays. Low-Earth orbits generally allow use of
orbit average flux values for heat balance calculations on internal compo-
nents,since their orbit periods are short relative to the thermal time constant of the
components.

Geosynchronous spacecraft can utilize average fluxes on only the north and south
sides because the Sun maintains a constant angle to those surfaces over an orbit; the
other four sides each get about 12 hours of Sun at varying angles of incidence during
the 24 hour orbit.

Example

Problem: Determine the radiator area and heater size needed for a group of
electronics boxes located on the nadir face of an Earth pointing spacecraft. These
boxes have an allowable mounting surface temperature range, while operating, of -10
to +50 °C and a minimum non-operating temperature of -20 °C. the electronics boxes
dissipate a maximum of 500 W and a minimum of 400 W when operating and 0 W
when not operating. Assume a 5-year mission in a 500 km altitude, 90 deg inclination
Earth orbit.

Solution: A nadir facing radiator will receive Earth IR and albedo heat loads along
with some direct solar illumination in this low-Earth orbit. The Earth IR load will be
constant around the orbit since the radiator is constantly facing straight down. Albedo
will be at a maximum near the sub-solar point and decrease to near zero as the space-
craft crosses the terminator. Because there is only a brief period, between eclipse
entrance or exit and terminator crossings, when this surface will receive direct solar
illumination at a shallow angle of incidence, we will neglect the contribution of direct
solar load in this calculation. (To be rigorous, one could calculate the solar load using
the equations provided in Sec. 5.1.)

Using Eqs. (11-17) and (11-18) and the tables in Appendix D.2, we can calculate
the absorbed Earth IR and albedo fluxes for a number of points around the orbit. If we
assume that the radiator has the 5-mil thick silver teflon surface finish commonly used
on radiators in low-Earth orbit, the radiator will have an emittance of 0.78 and a
minimum beginning of life solar absorptance of 0.05. Because the radiator absorp-
tance will increase over its life, however, we must also consider an end-of-life
absorptance value of 0.15 to account for the degradation that will occur over the 5-year
mission. The results of these calculations are shown in Table 11-48B.

Because the thermal time constant of a radiator coupled to electronics boxes is large
compared to the orbital period, we can size the radiator to orbit-average fluxes. From

aHot case: EOL absorptance of 0.15 and maximum albedo (0.30) and Earth IR (244 W/m2) constants
bCold case: BOL absorptance of 0.05 and minimum albedo (0.23) and Earth IR (218 W/m2) constants

Table 11-48A we can see that the hottest case occurs at end of life for an orbit B angle
of O deg. If we allow for 10 °C of analysis uncertainty margin, we can use Eq. (11-15)
and set the sum of the maximum electronics waste heat and the heat load absorbed
from the environment under hot case conditions to equal the radiator heat rejection
capacity at 40 °C (313 °K):

500 W + (182 W/m2) A = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-8 W/m2K4) A (313 °K}4 (11-19)

Solving for A, we get an area of 2.06 m2.

To determine if any heater power is required during normal operations, we again use
Eq. (11-15) to calculate the minimum temperature under cold-case conditions. We use
the above area with the cold case power dissipation of 400 W and cold case environ-
mental loads from the 90 deg f angle orbit to solve for temperature:

400 W + (148 W/m?) (2.06 m2) = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-8 W/m2K4) (2.06 m2) (T)4 (11-20)

Solving for T, we get a cold case minimum temperature of 297 °K = 24 °C. Subtract-
ing 10 °C for analytical uncertainty gives a minimum operating radiator temperature
of 14 °C, which is well above the minimum allowable operating termperature of
—10°C.

To determine the heater power required to keep the electronics above their
minimum non-operating temperature limit, we add 10 °C of uncertainty margin to the
minimum allowable non-operating termperature and use Eq. (11-15) to solve for the
power required to keep the radiator above —10 °C under cold case conditions:

(XW) + (148 W/m?) (2.06 m2) = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-8. W/m2K4) (2.06 m2) (263 °K)4 = (11-21)

Solving for X, we get a heater power of 131 W needed to keep the electronics above
their non-operating minimum temperature limit under worst-case conditions.

11.5.6 Mass, Power, Telemetry Estimates

Mass

Historically, the TCS mass loosely correlates to the spacecraft dry mass or total
spacecraft power generation capability. Typically the thermal control hardware mass
is 2 to 10% of the spacecraft or instrument dry mass. A purely passive thermal control
approach tends toward the lower end of the range. If active control techniques are
used, the mass tends toward the higher end of the range.

As the complete thermal control approach is formulated and a hardware list is
developed component-level estimates can be performed to provide a more accurate
assessment. For low-power spacecraft, the bulk of the thermal mass is usually the
MLI, but if radiator panels or heat transport systems are to be used, their mass
should be estimated early. Any heater controller electronics, as well as all heaters,
wiring, and thermostats, should be included in the thermal control subsystem mass
estimate.

power for typical components of the thermal control system are shown here.

Power

Thermal control power estimates normally only consist of heater power, unless
electronic controllers are used. The power required for operation of dedicated
electronics used for thermal control should be allocated to the thermal system
estimates.

* Operational: for worst case energy balance determination, these estimates
should be made for the coldest operational scenario. Mechanical thermostats
or electronic controllers with a combination of proportional, integral, and
differential functionality may provide control of these heaters. Onboard soft-
ware may also be utilized if sufficient temperature sensors are provided.

458 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5

* Survival: these estimates should be based on a cold survival scenario. Circuits
should be controlled in the most reliable (and redundant) manner, utilizing the
minimum resources that would likely exist in this mode, e.g., reduced onboard
software capability may not allow for heater control algorithms or fault
detection and isolation routines. For example, hydrazine propulsion systems
require protection from freezing (2 °C) at all times and should be considered
as a Survival circuit.

Telemetry and Commands

Temperature sensors that are located inside components are used to ensure the
correct temperature information is monitored and a determination of the thermal
health and safety status of the spacecraft or instrument can be made. Every effort
should be made to provide for sufficient temperature sensors early in the program, to
ensure that sufficient interfaces are available to read these sensors. Thermal com-
mands are usually necessary only when electronic or software heater control is used.
While commands can usually be added late in the design flow, the associated hardware
(relays to enable or disable the circuit) must be identified early.

Lockheed Martin Astronautics

The structures and mechanisms subsystem mechanically supports all other space-
craft subsystems, attaches the spacecraft to the launch vehicle, and provides for
ordnance-activated separation. The design must satisfy all strength and stiffness
requirements of the spacecraft and of its interface to the booster. Primary structure
carries the spacecraft’s major loads; secondary structure supports wire bundles, pro-
pellant lines, nonstructural doors, and brackets for components typically under 5 kg.

In this section, we describe how to develop a preliminary design for a structures
subsystem. We begin by considering the spacecraft’s operating environments and de-
signing the structure with overall spacecraft packaging in mind. After conducting nu-
merous design trades, we then assess each structural member for its most likely failure
modes, possible weight savings, and need for reinforcement. See Fig. 11-25 for details.

Design

Fig. 11-25. The Preliminary Design Process for Structures and Mechanisms. We move
from left to right, iterating as needed, when designing the spacecraft structure.

11.6.1 Structural Requirements

Structures must endure environments from manufacture to the end of the mission.
Team members should contribute from all disciplines: engineering, manufacturing,
integration, test, and mission operations. This interdisciplinary approach ensures
coverage of all critical requirements—even those which seem minor. The following
discussion of the Space Shuttle’s external tank structure show why we should not over-
look any event in the structure’s lifetime.

The aluminum skin of the external tank must have a very tight manufacturing
tolerance. Adding just 0.0254 mm (0.001 in) thickness to the entire shell of its forward
tank for liquid oxygen adds 220 kg to tank mass. Special handling fixtures must cradle
the tank’s wall sections to keep them from collapsing during welding, as they cannot

460 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6

support their own weight. The nose section of the completed external tank experiences
its most severe loads before launch from winds occasionally gusting against an empty
and unpressurized tank. Table 11-50 lists typical mission phases and possible sources
for structural requirements.

tural design must account for specific loads in every phase.

The launch vehicle is the most obvious source of structural requirements, dictating
the spacecraft’s weight, geometry, rigidity, and strength. The launch vehicle, selected
orbit, and upper stage determine the spacecraft’s allowable weight. See Table 18-4 for
launch-vehicle data.

The core body structure and spacecraft adapter typically account for 10% to 20%
of a spacecraft’s dry weight. Appendages, component boxes, and “most secondary
structures apply to the weight of other subsystems. On the structures and mechanisms
subsystem, we normally increase the estimated weight by 10% for fasteners and
fittings. We should also add approximately 25% for weight growth to account for
program additions, underestimating, and inadequate understanding of requirements.
The spacecraft item most often underestimated or neglected is electronic wiring,
sometimes approaching 10% of a spacecraft’s dry weight. Of course, allowances for
weight growth may vary for a component or subsystem, based on its design maturity
and schedule risk. As subsystem designs mature, known weights replace growth
estimates.

A spacecraft’s size depends on choosing the payload fairing compatible with the
launch vehicle. These protective shrouds shield the spacecraft from direct air loading

Reentry and Landing
(if applicable)

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 461

and contamination. The spacecraft and its fairing have a prescribed dynamic envelope,
or space allocation, that takes into account expected deflection and the possible addi-
tion of thermal protection blankets. The spacecraft must be rigid enough so the fairing
and spacecraft do not encroach on each other’s envelope. Although the Space Shuttle
does not have a traditional payload fairing, its cargo bay requires a similar envelope.
See Fig. 18-8 for an example.

The spacecraft’s rigidity requirements specify more than maximum deflection. A
launch-vehicle structure has certain natural frequencies that respond to forces from
both internal (engine oscillations) and external (aerodynamic effects) sources. The
launch vehicle contractor lists known natural frequencies for each launch vehicle (see
Table 18-9) and describes associated axial, bending, or torsional (twisting) modes. The
spacecraft structure tailored to avoid the launch vehicle’s natural frequencies will
experience much lower loads. Typical resonance sources to avoid include interaction
between the spacecraft and the launch vehicle’s control system, oscillations in the
propulsion system (pogo), aerodynamic buffeting during ascent, and bending of the
solid rocket motors.

Engine thrust during launch and ascent exposes the spacecraft to steady-state
acceleration along its axis. This acceleration steadily increases as a booster depletes
fuel (less mass to propel), but comes to an abrupt end, or transient, at burn-out. The
acceleration resumes suddenly, with another transient, as the next stage ignites. Wind
gusts and vehicle maneuvers can induce lateral transients. Transients and steady-state
accelerations cause inertial loads, commonly specified as load factors, or multiples of
weight at sea level. Table 18-8 shows typical load factors for several launch-vehicle
events.

Random vibration from engines and other sources is a critical source of load. At
lift-off, the major source of random vibration is acoustic noise, which radiates from
the engines to engulf the vehicle. Acoustics develop from aerodynamic turbulence
when the vehicle passes through the transonic portion of its flight. Structures with high
surface area and low mass, including skin sections and solar array panels, respond
strongly to acoustic noise.

Load factors do not express random vibration correctly. Three parameters that help
describe random vibration are distribution, frequency content, and magnitude. Typi-
cally we assume that a random spectrum has a Gaussian distribution, which determines
the percentage of time the vibration is within certain limits. The frequency content is
most commonly expressed as power spectral density (PSD) even though “accelera-
tion” is more precise than “power” in this application. Vibrational power in a signal is
proportional to acceleration-squared. This is divided by the frequency bandwidth over
which the signal was integrated, to make the quantity independent of bandwidth. Thus,
PSD is in units of g2/Hz. To illustrate the power spectral density, we use a log-log plot
of g2/Hz against frequency. The square root of the area under the curve is the time
history’s rms value. This value equals one standard deviation, 0, of the random accel-
eration. Figure 11-26 shows a random signal, its normal distribution, and a typical
PSD plot.

Pyrotechnic shock, another source of load, comes from explosive separation events
involving the boosters, payload fairing, and spacecraft, as well as release mechanisms
for solar panels and other deployable appendages. This shock causes high acceleration
and high frequency over a very short time (see Fig. 18-11). Because shock loads
attenuate quickly, they seldom damage structures removed from the immediate
impulse, but they may seriously harm nearby electronic components.

with the same vertical scale, describes the relative likelihood of acceleration being
at a given value. This is a normal distribution, with each tick mark on the vertical
scale representing a standard deviation, o. The figure on the right is a plot of power
spectral density. It describes the frequency content of the vibration and is equal to
the mean-square acceleration (g2) in a selected frequency band divided by the
width, in Hz, of that band.

In actual design, we combine math models of the spacecraft and launch vehicle to
do a coupled loads analysis. In this analysis, we drive the coupled model with forcing
functions (force as a function of time or frequency) that are based on measured launch-
vehicle environments. Before we get to this point, though, we must configure the
structure, select from our design options, and roughly size the structure based on esti-
mated design loads.

11.6.2 Packaging and Configuring the Subsystem

Designers must trade the low weight of a high-density design against the need to
access individual components for testing or replacement before launch. The prelimi-
nary arrangement should account for every component in the design because the
spacecraft’s structure inevitably becomes heavier if it must accommodate new compo-
nents. Added component mass multiplies through higher allowances for weight
growth, heavier structure for support, and more onboard propellants for attitude
control.

The payload and the attitude control approach most strongly influence a space-
craft’s configuration, and the launch vehicle constrains it. Chapter 9 discusses
payloads and their requirements. Section 11.1 discusses spin- and 3-axis stabilization
to control attitude. A spin-stabilized spacecraft influences packaging most because the
mass moment of inertia (MON)* about the spin axis must be greater than any other axis
to maintain stability. In 3-axis stabilized spacecraft, we must separate the magnetic
torque rods and the magnetometer (device that senses the Earth’s magnetic field) to
preclude any magnetic interference between them.

Sensing devices always require specific fields of view and pointing accuracy. The
packaging designer must locate sensors to be unobstructed by antennas or solar arrays.

* Tis the standard notation for both mass moment of inertia and area moment of inertia. In this
section, we use MOI for mass moment of inertia and / for area moment of inertia.

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 463

Advanced composite materials often help mounting-structure designs meet require-
ments for rigidity and thermoelastic distortion.

Communication antennas also require rigidity, thermoelastic stability, and a clear
field of view. One solution is to mount sensors and antennas on an appendage that is
stowed during launch, deployed on orbit for an unobstructed view, and constructed of
advanced composite materials for rigidity and thermoelastic stability.

Components for command and data handling are often vulnerable to the environ-
ments of outer space, so we usually bury them in the center of the spacecraft to shield
against radiation. Interfacing wire bundles also weigh less when the processor, data
bus, and other control components are close together.

Propulsion subsystems include reaction-control assemblies and orbital transfer
stages. By purchasing thrusters in multiaxis combinations, called rocket engine
modules, we can reduce the number of propellant-line welds needed on site during the
spacecraft’s assembly. We usually place those modules on the spacecraft’s periphery—far
from the spacecraft’s center of mass—-but we must keep them from contaminating
sensors, antennas, and solar array cells with propellant gases. A propulsion system
with a low operating pressure helps lessen the propellant tank’s weight. Another
structural challenge is the need to support transfer stages, so the thrust vector remains
aligned with the spacecraft’s center of mass. These stages are usually heavy; so,
placing them on the bottom of the spacecraft stack, near the launch vehicle interface,
helps minimize structural weight. ,

The configuration of the power subsystem varies with power requirements and
orbital conditions. For example, we must determine where to stow solar panels during
launch and where to deploy them in orbit, so they do not touch or rest in the shadow
of other subsystems. By using fewer folds in the panels, we can keep the deployment
mechanisms simple and more reliable. Finally, batteries should be accessible for
pre-launch testing or replacement and placed where they will be at their optimum
temperature. Thermal control specialists can place components, select materials, and
suggest surrounding structure (open truss or closed skin panels with stiffeners) to help
control temperature. These measures help us avoid using other active temperature
control devices.

If we configure the structure and package components at the same time, we may
make the components part of the load-carrying structure. This concurrent approach
may also produce better symmetry in the structure, which satisfies frequency response
requirements. By using common members and joints throughout the design, we can
lower fabrication costs and more easily meet weight allocations. For example, beams
that make the spacecraft rigid can also support components. Establishing design routes
for wire bundles and propellant lines helps avoid the inefficiencies of cutting through
structure later. We should design special joints to connect members made with differ-
ent materials because their varying rates of thermal expansion and contraction can be
detrimental. Finally, the spacecraft adapter must transition smoothly from the space-
craft to the interface on the launch vehicle’s upper stage.

11.6.3 Design Options

In designing a structure, we consider optional materials, types of structure, and
methods of construction. To select from these options, we do trade studies to compare
weight, cost, and risk.

A typical spacecraft structure contains metallic and nonmetallic materials. Most
metals are very nearly homogeneous, having constant properties throughout their

464 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6

composition, and isotropic, having the same properties regardless of direction. Non-
metals are usually formed with composites, or blends of more than one material.
Composite materials are not homogeneous and are normally not isotropic.

Materials are selected based on:

* Strength * Ductility (which can prevent cracks)
* Stiffness ¢ Fracture toughness (ability to resist
* Density (weight) crack growth)

¢ Thermal conductivity * Ease of fabrication

¢ Thermal expansion * Versatility of attachment options,

such as welding
¢ Availability

¢ Corrosion resistance
¢ Cost

By far the most commonly used metal for spacecraft structure is aluminum alloy, of
which there are many types and tempers. Aluminum is relatively lightweight, strong,
readily available, easy to machine, and low in raw material cost. The stiffness-to-
weight ratio of aluminum is about the same as steel, but the strength-to-weight ratio is
usually higher. The main advantage of aluminum over steel for flight structures is its
lower density. For the same mass, an aluminum shell or plate would be thicker and
thus able to carry a greater compressive load before it would buckle. If we need harder
or denser materials, we normally choose steel or titanium.

Alloys are available in sheets, plates, extrusions, forgings, and castings. The pri-
mary source of material properties is MIL-HDBK-5, Metallic Materials and Elements
for Aerospace Vehicle Structures (U.S. Air Force Materials Laboratory, 1994], which
contains many properties and statistically guaranteed strengths for all commonly used
aerospace metals.

One popular advanced composite is graphite-epoxy, which has graphite fibers for
strength and stiffness in an epoxy matrix. Composite fabric layers normally bond
together in designed fiber orientations, so they can provide properties not available in
homogeneous metallic materials, including extremely high stiffness-to-weight ratios
and negligible expansion and contraction resulting from temperature gradients. Other
fibers in these composites include boron, Kevlar™, and glass. Graphite and boron
fibers also reinforce metal-matrix composites. Techniques to manufacture and apply
metal-matrix composites are presently less advanced than for epoxy-matrix materials.
Tsai [1987] and MIL-HDBK-17 [1977, 1989] provide more information on composite
materials.

Table 11-51 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the most com-
monly used materials in spacecraft design. Table 11-52 shows their representative
properties.

Types of structures include skin panel assemblies, trusses, ring frames, pressure
vessels, fittings, brackets, and equipment boxes. Sometimes only one meets objec-
tives; but we usually have several options. We use monocoque structures, which are
panels and shells without attached stiffening members, only if applied and reacted
loads are spread out rather than concentrated. A semimonocoque shell has lightweight,
closely spaced stiffening members (stiffeners) that increase its buckling strength. Skin-
stringer structures have longitudinal members (stringers) and lateral members
(frames) to accept concentrated loads and skin to spread those loads out and to transfer
shear. A truss is an assembly that remains stable under applied concentrated loads with
its structural members loaded only axially. A sandwich structure is a panel or shell

constructed of thin face sheets separated by a lightweight core; this form of construc-
tion efficiently adds bending stiffness and stability. Section 15.3 of Sarafin [1995]
provides guidance for selecting the above types of structures.

We can attach structural elements with adhesive bonds, welds, or mechanical
fasteners. But regardless of the selected structure type and method of attachment,
much of the structural subsystem’s weight will be in the fittings used to transfer load
from one member to another.

Most composite material structures have metal end fittings or edge members
attached by bonding, but the bond’s strength depends on the process and workman-
ship. Normally, we must select a proper bonding process through development testing.
We can use bolts instead; however, local stress concentrations around the fasteners can
cause failure at load levels much lower than a composite material can otherwise sus-
tain. Welding is also possible for most aluminum alloys, but heat from welding can
lower material strength near welds by more than 50%. If we need stiffness more than
strength, we may choose welding over mechanical joints. As with bonding, welding
processes require strict development, control, and testing.

The strength of mechanical fasteners, such as rivets and bolts, is very dependable
as a result of process controls, inspections, and frequent sample testing. But to fully

develop fastener strength, we must provide adequate fitting thicknesses, fastener spac-
ing, and edge distances. The torque value for installing a tension fastener must provide
a preload that will maintain stiffness and preclude fatigue, which is a failure resulting
from cracks that form and grow because of cyclic loading. A locking feature, typically

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 467

a deformed thread in the nut or insert, will prevent a threaded fastener from backing
out when the structure vibrates. Many similar guidelines help us design a dependable
structural joint.

11.6.4 Structural Design Philosophy and Criteria

To develop a structure light enough for flight, and to keep spacecraft affordable, we
must accept some risk of failure. Material strengths vary because of random, undetect-
able flaws and process variations, and loads depend on unpredictable environments.
Random variables affect the adequacy of most structures, such as a dam whose load
depends on how much it rains; but for space missions, we must accept a higher prob-
ability of failure than for most other types of structures. Launch loads are affected by
many different random variables, such as acoustics, engine vibrations, air turbulence,
and gusts, and we seldom have enough data to confidently model the probability
distributions of these variables.

Because of loads uncertainty, we cannot accurately quantify the structural reliability
of a spacecraft. We can approximate it, however, and we can develop design criteria
that will provide acceptable reliability. Let us work backwards from a subsystem-level
reliability to understand how conservative our design approach should be for an indi-
vidual structural part.

If we select a goal for structural reliability of 99% (we probably should aim higher),
which means there is a 1% chance of a mission-ending structural failure, we must
design each structural element to much higher reliability. If the structure has 1,000
parts whose failure would jeopardize the mission, and if their chances of failure are
independent, each must have 99.999% reliability (0.999991000 = 0,99, from probabil-
ity theory). This explains why design criteria may appear so conservative. To achieve
appropriate reliability, many programs use the following ground rules:

¢ Use a design-allowable strength for the selected material that we expect 99%
of all specimens will equal or exceed.

¢ From available environmental data, derive a design limit load equal to the
mean value plus three standard deviations. This means there will be 99.87%
probability that the limit load will not be exceeded during the mission, assum-
ing the load variability has a Gaussian distribution. Because data will be
limited, we can only approximate the true probability level of the design load;
but “3-sigma” remains the goal. (Some programs aim for 99% probability
instead of 30.)

Multiply the design limit load by a factor of safety, then show that the stress
level at this load does not exceed the corresponding allowable strength.

Test the structure to verify design integrity and/or workmanship, to correlate
analytical models, and to protect against human errors.

Table 11-53 summarizes the criteria used to design space structures.

Space programs use different factors of safety, but most recognize the need to
balance the factors with the type of structure and scope of testing. Factors of safety are
highest for pressure vessels and for structures we will not test. For most other
structures, a contractor will be able to choose from several test options. Table 11-54
shows the test options for an unmanned launch. If personnel safety is at risk, as for a
Shuttle launch or during ground handling, we use higher factors.

468 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6

TABLE 11-53. Terms and Criteria Used in Strength Analysis. We design space structures to
meet specified or selected criteria for preventing yield and ultimate failures. A
yield failure is one in which the structure suffers permanent deformation that
degrades the mission; ultimate failure is rupture or collapse. Two factors of
safety—one for yield and one for ultimate—typically apply to a structural assem-
bly, and depend on the selected test option (Table 11-54). For each structural
member, the allowable load, the design load, and the margin of safety each have
two values, one for yield and one for ultimate.

Load Factor A multiple of weight on Earth, representing the force of inertia that resists
acceleration. The load factor applies in the direction opposite that of the
acceleration. For example, an object under an acceleration of 5 g, where
g is the gravitational acceleration, has a load factor of —5; if that object
weighs 500 N (a mass of 51 kg), the force it exerts on its support structure
is -2,500 N.

Limit Load The maximum load expected during the mission or for a given event, ata

(or design limit load) specified or selected statistical probability (typically 99% for expendable
launch vehicles and 99.87% for launches with humans aboard). The load
can be acceleration, load factor, force, or moment.

Allowable Loador _ The highest load or stress a structure or material can withstand without
Stress failure, based on statistical probability (usually 99%; i.e., only 1% chance

the actual strength is less than the allowable).

Factor of Safety, FS A factor applied to the limit load to obtain the design load for the purpose
of decreasing the chance of failure.

Design Load Limit load multiplied by the yield or ultimate factor of safety; this value
must be no greater than the corresponding allowable load.

Design Stress Predicted stress caused by the design load; this value must not exceed
the corresponding allowable stress.

Margin of Safety, MS A measure of reserve strength:

Allowable load (or stress)

MS = -
Design load (or stress)

—120 to satisfy design criteria

TABLE 11-54. Typical Test Options and Factors of Safety for Missions without Humans
Aboard. [DoD-HDBK-343]. See Table 11-53 for definitions and use.

Design Factors of Safety
1.0

1. Ultimate test of dedicated qualification article (1.25 x limit)

2. Proof test of all flight structures (1.1 x limit)

3. Proof test of one flight unit of a fleet (1.25 x limit)

4. No structural test

Typically, a program will vary the test option for different components depending
on type of structure, material or method of construction, weight criticality, perceived
test difficulty, program schedule, and planned quantity of flight articles.

We should proof test (option 2) each flight article if strength is significantly af-
fected by workmanship or process variations. The test conditions should apply the

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 469

critical stresses in all load directions possible during the mission. Proof tests should
also include the effects of predicted temperature changes during the mission, which
can be significant in certain types of structures. Proof testing is the only viable option
for advanced composite structures and bonded joints, unless we can become confident
that our processes are controlled well enough to keep strength variations low. We also
proof test all pressure vessels.

If strength is relatively insensitive to workmanship, such as for most mechanically
fastened metals, we can choose any of the four test options. When building many arti-
cles, we can save money by testing just one (option 3), but this option carries a weight
penalty because of its high factors of safety. Alternatively, we can build a dedicated
qualification article and use the lower factors of safety that go with the “Ultimate Test”
(option 1). With this approach, we have three additional benefits:

1. We can shorten the flight-article development schedule by conducting the
test program in parallel.

2. We can use the test article as a pathfinder for launch-site operations.
3. The impact of test failure is not as severe.

We must weigh these advantages against the cost of building the test article, for which
we must use the same processes as for the flight structure.

Option 4 (“No Test’’) can be risky, and we must use it with caution. The space
industry has no design codes, such as for many commercial structures, and relies
heavily on testing to verify structural integrity. Without a test, a critical analysis error
or oversight could lead to a mission-ending structural failure, even with high factors
of safety. However, with caution, we can confidently use this option for relatively sim-
ple structures. The “no test” option may be most cost effective for structures designed
for stiffness rather than strength.

To provide confidence the structure will survive multiple loading cycles, we also
perform fatigue analysis. Fatigue is a much greater concern for aircraft than for most
primary structures in a spacecraft because launch is of such short duration. But if
stresses are high enough, it does not take many cycles for a material to fatigue, and
launch is not the only event that can cause fatigue damage. Ground testing and trans-
portation can significantly degrade service life. Structures sensitive to high-frequency
vibrations or on-orbit thermal cycling are particularly susceptible to fatigue.

All materials have internal defects, most of which are microscopic. The number,
sizes, and locations of these defects all contribute to high variability in fatigue life
between specimens of the same material. In a fatigue analysis, we compare the number
of cycles at the limit stress level with the test-determined average number of cycles at
which failure occurs. We account for variability in a material’s fatigue life by multi-
plying the predicted number of load cycles over the mission life by a scatter factor of
four [Rolfe and Barsom, 1977].

To account for the possibility of a large pre-existing flaw in a critical location of a
structural part, we can establish a fracture control program. This includes inspections
of raw materials and fabricated parts for defects, special handling procedures for
critical parts, and fracture-mechanics safe-life analysis. This analysis, which is a semi-
empirical method of predicting crack growth and part life, is more conservative than
fatigue analysis because we assume an initial crack exists at the location of peak stress.
We set the size of the assumed initial crack equal to the minimum our inspection
methods can reliably detect. MIL-HDBK-5G provides fatigue and fracture mechanics
data for most metals.

11.6.5 Preliminary Sizing of Structural Members

To size the structural members of a spacecraft, we consider stiffness, strength, and
weight. We will rarely find a design in the first iteration that is acceptable for all three.
Before the design is final, we will perform many iterations that also consider fatigue
life, cost, and changes in subsystem requirements.

Stiffness—Flexibility is a measure of how much a structure deflects under unit
load. Stiffness is a measure of force required to cause a unit displacement. (For a
single-degree-of-freedom system, stiffness is the inverse of flexibility.) A structure’s
mode shapes and natural frequencies of vibration depend on its stiffness and mass
properties. We discussed typical considerations for stiffness in Sec. 11.6.1.

We can estimate the primary frequencies of a stowed spacecraft by representing it
with an equivalent beam, which simulates mass properties and core stiffness, then
using simple beam-frequency equations provided in Sec. 11.6.6. As the design
evolves, we construct a finite element model (a mathematical representation of the
structure) to obtain more accurate predictions of mode shapes and frequencies. For a
given mode of vibration, most finite element software can identify the locations in a
structure that have the most strain energy, which is the energy absorbed when a struc-
ture deforms under load. Reinforcing the areas with high strain energy is the most
efficient way to stiffen a structure.

A structural assembly is usually more flexible than predicted by a math model
because of local flexibility in mechanical attachments. Thus, even if our model dem-
onstrates the design is adequate, we may find out during testing that the structure
doesn’t meet stiffness requirements. It usually doesn’t cost much in weight to stiffen
a joint—the key is being aware of stiffness in the design of attachments. We should
also not cut a stiffness requirement too close before verifying it by test.

Strength—We can use various methods to predict distributions of internal loads,
depending on the structure’s complexity and the. scope of our analysis. Free-body
diagrams show applied load, which in preliminary design equals weight multiplied by
load factor at the center of gravity, and the reactions necessary for static equilibrium.
With these diagrams, we can easily determine member loads in a statically determi-
nate structure, which has just one solution for member loads that satisfies equilibrium.
Finite element analysis is the most efficient method of predicting loads in a statically
indeterminate structure, which has redundant load paths.

To have adequate strength, the structure must not rupture, collapse, or deform such
that its function is impaired. Primary structural members made of ductile materials
seldom rupture in tension for two reasons: (1) Most structures are statically indetermi-
nate, and ductile materials will stretch enough prior to failure for loads to redistribute.
(2) Tension is an easy mode of failure to assess for a member of constant cross-section
and is seldom overlooked. Instead, tension members fail most often at their attach-
ments: fittings, welds, fasteners, and adhesives.

Stability is a structure’s resistance to collapsing under compression. Compressive
failures are the most sudden and catastrophic, and they are often the hardest to predict.
An overall instability failure of a column is called buckling. This is the kind of failure
we would expect if we pushed on the ends of a long, slender rod. The load at which a
column buckles decreases with the square of its length. Crippling is a compression
failure that starts with local buckling of thin-walled flanges or webs in a member’s
cross-section.

We often design panels in skin-stringer structures to buckle under compressive
loads, with shear being transferred by diagonal tension. This is a common practice for

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 471

weight-critical structures and is not catastrophic if we design the rivets, stringers, and
frame members properly. Diagonal tension will induce lateral loads in edge members
that cause compression and bending, as discussed in Bruhn [1973].

We also must check that structural elements do not yield, or take on permanent
deformations that can jeopardize the mission. Yielding is a characteristic of all
structural materials except those that are perfectly brittle (no ductility). Other defor-
mations can be detrimental as well, such as shifting in mechanical joints, so we must
assess them as well.

When assessing rupture and collapse, we use design ultimate loads, which are limit
loads multiplied by the ultimate factor of safety. We use the yield factor of safety to
assess permanent deformations. The onset of compressive yielding will often be fol-
lowed by collapse because of reduced stiffness, so we should ensure there will be no
compressive yielding at design ultimate loads. _

Weight—Designers of flight structures quickly develop an instinct for meeting
requirements with the lightest structure. Throughout preliminary design, the configu-
ration and loads will change, and we will have to increase the sizes of many structural
elements. We will also find elements that are unnecessarily heavy, but we won’t
always change the design. As the design becomes more detailed, weight optimization
becomes increasingly difficult and complicates production.

At each design iteration, we compare a component’s weight with its allocation.
Once the allocation has been met, we focus our attention on other issues. The best
design will seldom be the lightest design—it will be the one that is optimal for the
system, considering performance, reliability, and cost.

11.6.6 Structural Mechanics and Analysis

A part made from a solid material will change shape as force is exerted on it.
Mechanics of materials is the term used to describe how materials respond to applied
forces and other environments. The most basic term in mechanics of materials is
stress, 0, which is the load, P, in a member, divided by its cross-sectional area, A,
(Fig. 11-27).

P
=— 11-39
A ( )

Typical units for stress are N/m2 and lb/in? or psi.
Strain, €,is a dimensionless measure of deformation for a given load. In Fig. 11-27
the bar’s length, L, is increased by AL in response to the axial load, P.

E= AL
L (11-40)
Solids experience some thinning when elongated under an axial load. Poisson’s
ratio, V, which describes this phenomenon, is the ratio of lateral-to-axial strain.

axial

Poisson’s ratio for metals lies in the range of 0.28 to 0.33.
The stiffness of a material is the relationship of its stress to strain for a given load.

™~

Fig. 11-27. Stress and Strain. Stress is load, P, divided by area, A. Strain is the change in
length, AL, divided by the initial length, L.

We express it as the modulus of elasticity* or Young’s modulus, E:

_O
e (11-42)

Values for E were shown in Table 11-52. Metals typically start by exhibiting a
linear relationship between stress and strain. Strain in this region is termed elastic
because it will return to zero after the load is removed.

Beyond a stress called the proportional limit (normally assumed to be the same
value in tension and compression), a material’s stress/strain curve is no longer linear.
In other words, if we design our structure such that its material is stressed above the
proportional limit, linear methods of analysis would no longer apply. This can be risky
because so many of our methods of analysis are based on the assumption of linearity;
any other assumption would make loads analysis, in particular, so cumbersome it
would be impractical. Inelastic effects influence structural stability more than any-
thing else. An effective guideline for preliminary design is to keep the design ultimate
compressive stress below the material’s proportional limit.

Above the elastic limit, which is often indistinguishable from the proportional limit
but can be higher, the material will undergo residual strain (plastic strain), which
remains after the load is removed. Convention has defined the yield stress to be the
stress that would cause the material to have a residual strain of 0.2%. Although the
material actually begins to yield at the elastic limit, such initial yielding is often not
noticeable in a structural assembly. For design, we commonly use the traditionally
defined yield stress, based on the assumption that 0.2% permanent strain would not be
detrimental. To design to this value, we need to make sure our structure would still
function properly if it sustained the corresponding permanent deformation.

A material that can yield substantially before rupturing is termed ductile. Ductile
materials can survive local concentrations of strain without failing, resist crack forma-
tion, and allow parts to be shaped through hammering and bending. Conversely, brittle
materials, such as ceramics, do not deform plastically before rupturing. In designing
with brittle materials, we must make sure the local concentration of strain around a
discontinuity, such as a drilled hole, does not cause an elastic stress that exceeds the

* Elasticity is the characteristic of a material to return to its original dimensions after an applied
force is removed.

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 473

rupture stress (ultimate stress). Otherwise, a crack would form and possibly grow
uncontrollably until the part ruptures. Brittle materials also are not as resistant to
impact loads; the area under a material’s stress/strain curve indicates how much
energy it can absorb before it ruptures. Figure 11-28 shows representative stress/strain
curves for ductile and brittle materials. Refer to Table 11-52 for statistically guaran-
teed design stresses for commonly used alloys.

Fig. 11-28. Representative Stress/Strain Curves for Ductile and Brittle Metals. We gener-
ate curves such as these from uni-axial tensile tests. The slope of the linear region
is the modulus of elasticity. When the material is unloaded, even when stressed
above the proportional limit, stress is again proportional to strain according to the
elastic modulus. The yield stress is the stress that causes a permanent strain of
0.002.

Beams are very common structural members. We characterize a beam by how it is
supported. Examples are described in Table 11-55 and can occur in various combinations.

Loads on beams may be concentrated forces, distributed weights or pressures, or
rotational loads, called bending moments. Figure 11-29 shows the symbols commonly
used for beam characteristics. Figure 11-30 includes examples of sketches called
free-body diagrams, showing beams in static equilibrium. Beams are said to be in
static equilibrium when they fully react all applied forces and moments—a very
important prerequisite for static structural analysis.

Some of the common beam equations and relationships can be explained by use of
the cantilevered beam example of Fig. 11-31A. The distributed lateral load, w(x),
places the beam in a state of bending and shear. We can see evidence of the bending
from the fact that the deformed beam is no longer straight (Fig. 11-31B). The shear is
the lateral force transmitted along the beam’s length. The shear reaction, R, at the fixed
end must be equal and opposite to the sum of w(x) or the beam would no longer be in
equilibrium.

The beam’s internal shear forces and bending moments can be expressed as func-
tions of the applied load w(x). The local variation in the shear force equals the load at
any point along the beam.

The force w(x) in Fig. 11-31 is neither tensile nor compressive as it is not applied
along the beam’s axis. However, from the shape of the deflected beam, we can see that
the upper surface of the beam is stretched; this material is in tension. Likewise, the bot-
tom material is shortened and is in compression. The tensile and compressive stresses
are necessary to react the applied bending load. The bending moment increases for
sections of the beam closer to the fixed end. For any individual cross-section of the
beam, the tensile and compressive stresses are maximum at the upper and lower
surfaces. Provided the maximum stress remains below the proportional limit, these
stresses vary linearly for parallel surfaces inward from the extremities, finally reaching
zero at a line called the neutral axis (Fig. 11-31C). Shearing stresses vary nonlinearly

476 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6

along the cross-section and, unlike bending stress, reach a maximum at the neutral
axis. Extensive beam equations for stress, deflection, and reactions to applied loads are
in Roark and Young [1975].

We can quantify a beam’s ability to resist bending loads using the second moment
of area of a cross-section. It is usually referred to as area moment of inertia, I, (or
moment of inertia for the section) and should not be confused with mass moment of
inertia used in control system analysis. The area moment of inertia about an arbitrary
axis is

Taxis = J area 1 (11-46)

where y is the distance from the centroid to the infinitesimal area, dA. Figure 11-32

presents values of J for several commonly used sections. For boxes and tubes, we find
the I for a section by subtracting the J of the “hole” from the total.

Fig. 11-32. Common Sections and Their Centroidal Moments of Inertia. For boxes and
tubes, we find the I for the section by subtracting the inner I from the outer I. Fora
very thin annulus, I = 7 rt.

For calculations of J with respect to an axis other than the neutral axis, we use the
parallel axis theorem.

I (any parallel axis) = J (neutral axis) + Ad ? (11-47)

where A is the cross-sectional area, and d is the distance between the two parallel axes.
The parallel axis theorem allows us to find the area moment of inertia for complex
sections, such as the I-beam in Fig. 11-33. Note that the area moment of inertia
increases for a reference axis other than the neutral axis.

The value for bending stress, Op, is given in Eq. (11-48) for a point on a symmetric
cross-section at a distance, c, from the neutral axis. Use of Eq. (11-48) assumes that

cross-sections remain planes after bending so that stresses will increase linearly away
from the neutral axis. To predict stress values above the material’s proportional limit,
we would use inelastic methods [Bruhn, 1973].

Op = TT (11-48)

When a column under axial compression suddenly deflects laterally, or bows, we

say that it buckles. Such an occurrence is usually catastrophic. Theoretically, a linear-

exceed the material’s proportional limit. Otherwise, we would replace E in this equa-
tion with E,, the tangent modulus, which is the slope of the stress/strain curve at the
operating stress level (the buckling stress, in this case). Premature column buckling
can also occur as a result of imperfect geometry and local buckling of flanges or webs
in the column. See Sarafin [1995] or Bruhn [1973] for details.

Fig. 11-34. Effective Lengths for Columns with Different End Conditions. The square of a
column's effective length, L’, is inversely proportional to the force that would cause
the column to buckle elastically. Conceptually, the effective length is the length over
which the buckled shape would approximate that of a buckled column with pinned
ends (center figure). For example, if the cantilevered column shown at left were to
buckle, its free end would deflect laterally, while its fixed end would not translate or
rotate. This shape is the same as half the shape of a buckled pinned-end column,
so L’ for the cantilever is 2L.

We can quickly evaluate combined axial, lateral, and bending loads on a thin-wall
cylinder using the equivalent axial load, P.g (Fig. 11-36):

Rg = Pt+— (11-51)

where M and R are defined on the figure.

The basis for Fg is that bending stress will be greatest at the two points farthest
from the cylinder’s neutral axis (one point in tension, the other in compression).
Because lateral and bending loads can usually come from any direction (wind or drag),
this peak stress can occur at any point. Therefore, we must size the cylinder for the load
that would create this peak stress along the cylinder’s circumference. Rg is an axial
load on a cylinder that would result in a uniform stress equal to a peak stress created
by a combination of an axial load and bending moment.

Pressure vessels are composed of doubly-curved shells such as spheres or ellip-
soids. See Fig. 11-37. By doubly-curved, we mean that the surface geometry can be
defined when two radii of curvature are known. Typical names for these radii are the
longitudinal or meridional radius of curvature, designated R,,,, and the circumferential
or hoop radius of curvature, Rj, In all cases, these radii are measured perpendicular to
the shell, not the central axis of symmetry. Figure 11-38 illustrates this double curvature.

Mass moment of inertia (MOI) is a measure of a solid’s tendency to resist rotational
forces. Rotational inertia depends on mass distribution and varies with the axis of
revolution selected as a reference. The MOI for a solid will always be smallest for an
axis passing through its center of mass” (Fig. 11-39).

parallel to x is

MOI,,.:= MOL, + (1,2 + L?)m

Sandwich structure consists of a lightweight, shear-resistant core bonded to outer
face sheets (Fig. 11-40). A sandwich panel acts like an I-beam. The faces correspond
to the top and bottom flanges of the beam and resist in-plane bending, tension, and
compression. The core acts like the I-beam’s web and carries shear and out-of-plane
loads, while providing support for the faces.

Sandwich Panel with Honeycomb Core

Face sheet

Fig. 11-40. Sandwich Panel with Honeycomb Core. By separating thin face sheets with a
lightweight core, we efficiently increase the bending strength and stiffness of a panel
or shell. Increasing the bending stiffness raises the buckling strength.

Face sheets and cores can be of nearly any metallic or composite material. The core
is usually formed into corrugations or honeycomb cells built from thin strips called
ribbons. Core properties are not isotropic, as stiffness in line with ribbons is greater
than transverse stiffness. To maintain the structural integrity of a sandwich, we must

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 483

make sure the adhesive bond between the core and face sheets is consistent. See Bruhn
[1973] for detailed sandwich analysis. Figure 11-41 shows how sandwich structure
can be stiffer than skin-only designs.

The deflection, 6, and natural frequencies, f,,,,, of simple beams are shown in
Fig. 11-42 for axial and lateral applied loads [Roark and Young, 1975]. When
considering only its first natural, or fundamental frequency, a structure can be ideal-
ized as a single-degree-of-freedom spring-mass system.

The spring is the structure. We can assume an equivalent beam to represent a space-

craft with a natural frequency,

Propulsion module structure

Some of the Magellan structures, such as the IUS and adapters on the propulsion
module, lent themselves to the use of truss or strut members. The truss member design
loads derive from preliminary load factors, the mass distribution, and the vehicle
geometry. All 12 truss members are graphite-epoxy tubes with machined titanium end
fittings. Four members are 10.2 cm in diameter. They were sized as beam-columns to
withstand axial loading and bending while partially supporting solar panels during
launch. The ultimate, equivalent axial load is 102,300 N. The other eight members are
8.9 cm in diameter and sized for 93,410 N.

The adapter cone for the Solid Rocket Motor is a honeycomb structure that transfers
the motor’s thrust loads from 24 equally spaced bolts at the forward end to four large
bolts that attach to the truss for the IUS at the aft end. The forward equipment module
consists of a tubular framework covered with thin shear panels. The frames are welded
2219 aluminum alloy 5.08-cm2 tubing with wall thicknesses varying from 1.27 to
3.81 mm. Numerous equipment boxes are attached to the tubes using threaded fasteners
for easy removal. The shear panels enclose the framework except where an equipment
box forms an effective load path. The tube-member sizes result from beam-column
analysis, including transient and acoustic loads.

11.6.7 An Example Problem

The following example parallels the process for sizing the spacecraft structure and
booster adapter in Table 11-56. Structural size and mass are driven by either strength
or stiffness requirements. We can begin the process by sizing the structure to meet load
requirements and check the resulting natural frequency, or we can begin with a fre-
quency requirement, size the structure, and check strength. Equations are provided to
do either. Most short, heavy spacecraft are strength driven and long, lighter spacecraft
or assemblies are stiffness driven. Any design with very thin skin or stringer sections
can be sensitive to stability failures.

cylinder that meets representative requirements described in Table 11-57.

Sizing for Rigidity to Meet the Natural Frequency Requirement

This cylinder has uniform thickness and, by definition, no ring or longitu-
dinal stiffeners. Using Eq. (11-57), we will find the minimum shell thickness that
meets the natural frequency requirements. With f,,2,=25 (axial) and 10 (lateral), E =
71 x 109 N/m2, mp = 2,000 kg (a weight of 19,614 N or 4,410 Ib), and L = 10 m, we

more critical. For a 0.286-cm thickness, the cylinder’s cross-sectional area is 180 cm?.

Applied and Equivalent Axial Loads

By multiplying the spacecraft weight by the load factors, we can derive the limit or
maximum expected loads. See Table 11-58 for the example cylinder limit loads.

TABLE 11-58. Cylinder Applied Loads. The distance is measured from the base to the cylinder’s
center of mass. Load factors are from Table 11-57.

With a bending moment arm of 5 m (the center of mass location is at the cylinder
mid-length), we can find the equivalent axial load using Eq. (11-51):

Rg = Ruxial + 2 = 127,500 + 2 RAD) _715,900N (11-61)
Limit load x Ultimate Factor of Safety = Ultimate Load (11-62)
or 715,900 x 1.25 = 894,900 N. (11-62b)

Sizing for Tensile Strength

The equation for axial stress, 0, is o= P/A. To size the cylinder for tensile strength,
we use the ultimate Peg load = 894,900 N, and the material’s allowable stress,
= 524 x 106 N/m?, and use A = 27Rt to solve for the required thickness.

way, using a factor of safety of 1.10 with limit load and F,, = 448 x 106 N/m2.

Sizing for Stability (Compressive Strength)

We must now size the cylinder for stability [Ref. Eqs. (11-52) and (11-53)], using
the cylinder thickness required for bending stability. The cylinder must withstand an

Thus, the cylinder is not adequate because the applied ultimate load is greater than
the critical buckling load. Structural integrity is often shown in terms of the margin of

From Eq. (11-55), we see that the meridional (longitudinal) pressure stress is half this
value.

Although these stresses are small, we must combine them with stresses from load
factors when sizing for tensile strength. The pressure and load factors must be time-
consistent (for example, do not combine lift-off loads with venting pressures that occur
later in the ascent). In the case of stability, internal pressure can strengthen a shell. We
can increase the reduction factor, y, slightly to account for the stiffening effect of the
internal pressure. Lateral shear will tend to lower the buckling load.

making allowances for material lost in drilled holes and cut outs.

The driving requirements for the monocoque cylinder are bending rigidity and
compressive stability, which represent actual design conditions. Please note that the
calculation for first natural frequency depends on a crude assumption of equally
distributed mass. In this example, we want only to illustrate methods and clarify the
need for iterative design. In an actual design, we would know the mass distribution and
use computerized techniques to get a more realistic weight for the structure.

If we break the cylinder into several assemblies, such as an adapter on the bottom
with a spacecraft bus on top, we could analyze each section separately. For cylinder
sections closer to the base, Peg loads increase. Thus, we would want to analyze differ-
ent sections for varying types of construction, each with its own applied loads. In this
example, we could assume that the spacecraft adapter occupies the bottom 2 m of the
cylinder, resulting in a preliminary mass of 519 x 2/10 = 103.8 kg.

Option 2—Skin-Stringer

Suppose we stiffen the cylinder with 12 longitudinal members, called stringers, and
11 circumferential rings, or frames. The cylinder’s circumference is 6.28 m, so the
30-deg stringer spacing results in a stringer spacing of 0.5236 m, measured along the
curved surface. The frames separate the cylinder into 10 sections, or bays, each with a
height of 1.0 m. Figure 11-45 identifies the stringers by number.

11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 491

It is reasonable to assume that the presence of stiffening stringers and rings in this
design allows us to reduce the skin’s thickness. A designer’s initial concern with a
thinner skin is buckling; the concern is real and we will indeed check for this mode of
failure. In addition, thin, external surfaces with large surface areas are also susceptible
to the acoustic environment. Acoustically driven loads are based on many factors,
including:

The launch vehicle’s acoustic environment

Location of the structure within the payload fairing, or shroud

Whether acoustic blankets are used to help diminish noise within the shroud

Type of structure (as we said, large and thin surfaces are more affected)

Whether the structure is an external or internal payload surface

Boundary conditions of the surface edges

Whether the surface is flat or curved

The first resonant frequency of the surface (depends on size, shape, thickness,
material’s modulus of elasticity, and edge boundary conditions).

The calculations for acoustic loads are cumbersome; see Sec. 7.7 of Sarafin [1995]
for an example of one technique. We will assume a starting standard gage skin thick-
ness of 0.127 cm is adequate against acoustic noise for our design.

First, we must choose whether to design the skin to help sustain load or whether to
allow it to buckle, forcing the stiffeners to take on more of the burden. In this example,
we will design the skin not to buckle, as is usually done when performing preliminary
sizing analysis. Chapter C11 of Bruhn [1973] provides details on how to analyze
buckled skin.

Stiffness

Again, let’s first size for stiffness. We already know from calculations for Option 1
that we need a skin thickness of 0.045 cm to meet the axial frequency requirement of
25 Hz. Therefore, the 0.127-cm-thick skin alone will be adequate for axial rigidity. In
the bending case, the required area moment of inertia, J, of the cylinder’s cross-section
is 8.98 x 105 cm4. The skin will satisfy part of this:

I skin = T R3 t = 1(1.0)3(0.001 27) = 4.00 x 105 cm4# (11-73)
Therefore, the contribution to J from the 12 stringers must equal the remainder:
Top = 8.98 X 105 — 4.00 x 105 = 4.98 x 105 cm4 (11-74)

We can calculate the J of the 12 stringers in the cylinder using the parallel axis the-
orem, I, = 2 (gm + Ad”). We can ignore the I,,,, or I about each stringer’s center of
mass, because it will be very small compared to its Ad? term. Therefore, the J of the
stringer system is a function of stringer cross-sectional area, A, and d, the distance
from the cylinder’s neutral axis (Table 11-60).

Therefore, J,,,= 4.98 x 105 cm+=A x 60,000 cm2. This results in a required cross-
sectional area of each stringer of 8.32 cm2. The cylinder area combines the skin and
twelve stringers for a total area of 180.00 cm2. Note that both the skin and stringers
must contribute to overall J to meet this requirement. When we allow skin to buckle,

(21.2 x 106) (0.0180 m2) = 381,000 N. The resulting margin of safety, MS, is

381,000,

The negative margin of safety points out the inadequacy of the design, so we must
add thickness to keep the panel from buckling, resulting in the values shown in
Table 11-61. When we increase the thickness like this to prevent panel buckling, we
can decrease the area of the stringers, with the goal of achieving the same total area
and moment of inertia needed for bending stiffness. With a skin thickness of 0.195 cm,
this means the required stringer area is 4.78 cm2.

Table 11-61 summarizes the estimation of mass for the skin-stringer option, using
a mass density of 2,800 kg/m>. Note we’ve included an extra 25% to account for ring
frames, which are needed to stabilize the stringers and fasteners; this is simply an
estimate. Note also that, in a real sizing exercise such as this, we would need to con-
firm the feasibility of only 4.78 cm? area for each stringer. To keep a stringer from
buckling as a column between ring frames, we need to design its cross section to have
a relatively large moment of inertia. A common strategy for doing this at low mass is
to use a thin-walled I- or C-section. However, we might find that, to provide the
needed area moment of inertia with an area of 4.78 cm2, we would need to make the
flanges and webs so thin that they could not carry the design load without buckling
locally. Chapter 8 of Sarafin [1995] explains how to assess column buckling and local
buckling for thin-walled structural members.

Skin-Stringer Option Summary

Strength and stability determine the structural design. With diagonal tension de-
signs, where we allow skin to buckle, we must calculate additional stringer and frame
loads. Solid and finite-element modeling is so prevalent in today’s industry that com-
puters are important even to the first stage of the design. Still, we must not substitute
computers for a thorough knowledge of the various modes of failure and the limits of
our assumptions.

Cylinder geometry is key in both the monocoque and skin-stringer examples. We
cube the length in the equation for bending rigidity, and use the radius prominently in
calculating stability. Table 11-63 illustrates the effects of making the cylinder shorter
and wider. Note that the resized cylinder has the same internal volume as the original
case, so we must verify that the launch vehicle’s shroud can handle the new size.

Mass decreases with a shorter cylinder, but the stability requirement becomes more
critical as the radius increases. More iterations with a shorter cylinder and additional
stringers would be appropriate. A more massive example would make the skin-stringer
design more attractive.

11.6.8 Mechanisms and Deployables

Aerospace mechanisms can be divided into high- and low-cyclic applications. The
former, such as antenna gimbals or solar array drives, require frequent or constant
articulation. The latter restrain a payload on launch or retrieval, or they propel the
payload to the deployed or restored position. Figures 11-46 and 11-47 show examples
of these mechanisms. The design is complete only when principles of mechanics and
environmental considerations lead to a producible and testable spacecraft. The most
challenging requirements for mechanisms are those that demand precision pointing
and a long operating life.

Fig. 11-46. High-Cyclic Mechanism, Rotary Actuator Assembly and Components. An
example of an aerospace mechanism requiring precision pointing (motor driven).

Requirements. Typical spacecraft requirements for aerospace mechanisms are as
follows:

¢ High-cyclic mechanisms ¢ Low-cyclic mechanisms
—Antenna pointing and tracking — Antenna launch retention
—Solar array pointing and — Antenna deployment
tracking — Solar array retention
—Attitude control reaction — Solar array deployment
wheels

— Contamination cover removal

—Boom extensions — Spacecraft/launch vehicle separation

The MIL-A-83577 [1988] specification for moving mechanical assemblies gives us
important technical guidance. The functional requirements for the mechanisms derive
from mission requirements and resolve into torques or forces and operating rates. An
operating rate profile, as shown in Fig. 11-48, establishes the payload articulation or
deployment rate. This profile determines the maximum angular acceleration, a. Once
we have determined the payload moment of inertia, MOI, we can compile the mecha-
nism’s operating torque, T = @ (MOI). For rough torque sizing, we can add a 20%
friction torque to the operating torque. The constant-speed part (s) of the operating
rate profile, represents the mechanism operating torque because there is no. accel-
eration during this phase. With the two operating points known, we can generate a
torque-speed curve (see Fig. 11-49). This linear curve establishes the stall torque and
theoretical no-load speed for the mechanism. When these mechanism-performance
characteristics are arithmetically manipulated by the mechanical advantage of a gear
train, the new performance characteristics represent the principal motor requirements.
With the mechanism’s stall torque now known, we can do first-order approximations
of the mechanism parameters using Fig. 11-50.

As an example, a solar array with moment of inertia, MOI, must be deployed by
rotating from a stowed position to a locked position in time, t. This time period involves
accelerating the array to a maximum rate, s,, then decelerating to the lock. Therefore,
the operating torque (operating point 1) equals moment of inertia, MOI, times acceler-
ation (s, +t/2). In the absence of other running friction data, we can assume operating
point 2 is 20% of operating point 1. Extrapolating to a stall torque (assume 200 Nem)
lets us use Fig. 11-50. If the mechanism had a 200 N-m stall torque, we can see that the
mechanism mass will be about 18 kg, require 90 W of power, and have a volume of
about 7,800 cm3. As a guideline, mechanisms should have a 100% torque margin to
provide for uncertainties of friction, payload inertia growth, and thermal effects.

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 497

Although weight, power, and volume are usually the three major spacecraft system
parameters, we must not severely constrain the mechanism’s weight. The mechanism
design should be robust to withstand stall torques and to maintain its structural
stiffness over a wide range of temperatures. The mechanism is not a major power con-
sumer. Low-cyclic mechanisms operate only a few times in the mission. High-cyclic
mechanisms draw high currents during the acceleration phase of the duty cycle, a
phase that is generally 10% of its operating life. Volume constraints will dictate the
design process. Also, requirements for mechanical and electrical interfaces will in-
fluence the mechanism’s volume and structure. The mechanism will also produce its
own requirements for torques or forces, operating rates, structural stiffness, operating
life and histogram (torque/cycle matrix), and environments. The mechanism must
withstand the launch and derived vibration tests, which will influence the strength and
stiffness requirements. The mechanism must operate in orbit, where the thermal-
vacuum environment will influence the selection of materials, lubricants, and coat-
ings. It will also create thermally induced loads caused by difference in coefficients of
thermal expansion of selected structural materials.

and Mil-A-83577 [1988].

11.7 Guidance and Navigation

James R. Wertz, Microcosm, Inc.

We use navigation” and orbit determination interchangeably to mean determining
the satellite’s position and velocity or, equivalently, its orbital elements as a function
of time. Similarly, we use both guidance and orbit control to mean adjusting the orbit
to meet some predetermined conditions. For satellites, orbit control has two important
subsets. Orbit maintenance refers to maintaining the orbital elements but not the tim-
ing of when the satellite is at a particular location in the orbit. Stationkeeping refers to
maintaining the satellite within a predefined box, which includes maintaining both the
in-track position and the other orbital elements. Altitude maintenance is an example of
orbit maintenance in which occasional thruster firings are used to overcome drag and
keep the orbit from spiraling downward. Geosynchronous stationkeeping maintains
the satellite in a box over one place on the Earth. Stationkeeping in low-Earth orbit
includes constellation maintenance, in which each satellite is maintained in a moving
box defined relative to the rest of the satellites in the constellation.

The satellite ephemeris is a tabular listing of the position and possibly the velocity
as a function of time, usually in electronic form. It is important to distinguish the
satellite ephemeris from the solar ephemeris, which lists the relative positions of the

* The origin of the terminology causes some confusion, particularly when reading older sources
or references not associated with satellites. Navigation traditionally referred to determining
how to get a craft where we wanted it to go. The term guidance was introduced with rockets
and missiles to mean computing the steering commands needed to make the rocket go where
we wanted it to (thus, a guided missile); control meant carrying out these steering commands
to adjust the vehicle’s direction of flight. Thus, an intercept missile would have a guidance
and control (G&C) system, and a space plane or interplanetary spacecraft would have a guid-
ance, navigation, and control (GN&C) system. However, for spacecraft we use navigation to
mean orbit determination, guidance to mean orbit control, and control system as a shortened
form of attitude control system.

498 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

Earth and Sun as the Earth travels in its orbit, and Junar and planetary ephemerides,
which provide similar data for other bodies in the solar system.

There are two types of orbit determination, differentiated by timing. Real-time orbit
determination provides the best estimate of where a satellite is at the present time and
may be important for spacecraft and payload operations, such as accurate pointing at
some target. Definitive orbit determination is the best estimate of the satellite position
and orbital elements at some earlier time. It is done after gathering and processing all
relevant observations. Orbit propagation refers to integrating the equations of motion
to determine where a satellite will be at some other time. Usually orbit propagation
refers to looking ahead in time from when the data was taken and is used either for
planning or operations. Occasionally orbits will be propagated backward in time,
either to determine where a satellite was in the past or to look at historical astronomical
observations in the case of comets or planets.

Traditionally, ground stations from around the world provide tracking data to a
mission-operations center. When all data is available, definitive orbit determination
provides the best estimate of the orbit. This is used to process the payload data for
science or observation missions. The best estimate of the orbit is then propagated
forward for real-time operations (such as star catalog selection or maneuver timing)
and further forward for mission planning.

In 1983 NASA launched the first Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS, to
begin replacing the worldwide ground tracking network.* TDRS provides the same
functions as the traditional ground-station network. As the name implies, it tracks low-
Earth orbiting satellites and relays data between the satellite and the TDRS ground
station in White Sands, NM. As described in Sec. 11.7.2, GPS, GLONASS, and other
more autonomous systems are also becoming operational, so orbit determination for
future systems will differ significantly from what it has been in the past.

We can think of orbit determination and control as analogous to attitude determi-
nation and control. The ADCS subsystem (Sec. 11.1) measures and maintains the
spacecraft’s orientation about its center of mass. Similarly, the guidance and naviga-
tion function, perhaps better thought of as the Orbit Determination and Control
Subsystem, or ODCS, measures and maintains the position of the spacecraft’s center
of mass. Both systems deal with spacecraft dynamics and both have the multiple func-
tions of acquisition, determination, maintenance, and maneuver control.

11.7.1 System Definition Process

Major changes are occurring in the guidance and navigation arena. Traditionally,
this has been exclusively a ground-operations activity. However, with the introduction
of GPS and advanced onboard computers, several options now exist for autonomous
navigation—determining the orbit on board the satellite in real time. We also have the
capability to perform autonomous orbit maintenance and control, so the orbit determi-
nation and control function will change significantly. Even if we ultimately choose a
completely traditional approach, we should evaluate new techniques which may
reduce cost and risk for a particular space mission.

Table 11-64 summarizes the process of defining the orbit determination and control
function. Each of the steps is described below. Section 11.7.2 then discusses the

principal alternatives for navigation systems, and Sec. 11.7.3 describes the alternatives
for maintaining and controlling the orbit. The implementation of these in hardware and
software is discussed in Sec. 11.7.4

of what is needed (mapping, pointing,
constellation maintenance, level of
autonomy), not how the mission is done

Step 1. Define top-level functions. We want to determine the key mission objec-
tives which require either navigation information or orbit maintenance and control.
Typically, we think of maintaining the satellite in a specialized orbit over the life of
the mission. Examples include a geostationary slot, Lagrange point orbit, or repeating
ground track orbit. We may also need stationkeeping to maintain the relative positions

500 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

between spacecraft in a constellation. Orbit control, but not orbit maintenance, is
needed to reach a particular destination such as rendezvous with another spacecraft,
landing on the Moon, or insertion into a particular geosynchronous slot.

Navigation has two basic purposes. It allows us to maintain and control the orbit,
just as attitude determination is used for attitude control. Thus, any requirement for
orbit control will ordinarily result in a corresponding requirement for navigation. We
may also need navigation information to process data from the payload. Although
some science missions may actually use position data (e.g., mapping of the magnetic
field or particle flux density), it is usually only part of payload pointing and mapping.
Irrespective of any orbit control, we often need to point an antenna or instrument at
some location or to define where an instrument is looking on the surface of the Earth.
Typically, this results in a more stringent navigation requirement than for purely
operational purposes.

Step 2. Do pointing and mapping trades. Because these are typically the most
stringent requirements, we must do the pointing and mapping trades described in
Sec. 5.4 to obtain a preliminary estimate of the needed accuracy. In most cases, the
pointing and mapping requirement can be met by trading between navigation and atti-
tude accuracy (see Fig. 4-6), so navigation trades will frequently need to be performed
in conjunction with attitude trades.

Step 3. Determine need for orbit control. At the system level, we must decide
whether we need to maintain or control the orbit. If we don’t, we may be able to save
money and weight by eliminating the propulsion subsystem. But if we need a propul-
sion system anyway, this hardware can often easily handle orbit maintenance and
control. At the same time, maintaining the orbit may significantly extend the mission
life and thereby reduce the cost per year.

Step 4. Do autonomous orbit control trade. If we must control the orbit, then we
need to determine whether to do so from the ground or autonomously on board the
spacecraft. Traditionally, the ground station has controlled the orbit. In most cases, this
remains the best approach if the orbit control activity is nonrecurring and com-
munications ‘with the satellite are straightforward, as in the case of transfer to
geosynchronous orbit. Here, orbit control needs are well defined, traditional ground
techniques are available, and it is needed only once during the mission. Thus, an
autonomous, onboard system would probably cost more than we would save from
lower operations expenses. However, autonomous orbit maintenance and control can
reduce life-cycle cost and risk for many missions (see Sec. 11.7.3). Over the next
decade, I expect it to become as common as autonomous attitude control is on today’s
spacecraft.

Step 5. Determine where navigation data is needed. Section 2.1.1 describes how
to do a data flow analysis to determine where data comes from and where it is needed.
If we choose not to design the system to minimize communications and data flow, our
decision must be justifiable. For example, we may choose to avoid the nonrecurring
cost of putting the processing where it would be most efficient. An extreme would be
a small LightSat with a single ground station which performs all of the data evaluation,
system control, and mission planning. In this case, it is probably easiest to do the
navigation on a small computer at the ground station. At the other extreme would be a
satellite communicating with many distributed users, each of whom needs to know
either the satellite position or derivative information such as the ground look-point
location. In this case, the navigation data is probably needed on board the spacecraft,
although we could navigate from the ground and uplink the results. The third possible

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 501

use of navigation data is by the spacecraft itself for payload functions such as pointing
or target selection and for real-time identification. We can also use navigation data for
spacecraft control functions such as orbit maintenance, star catalog selection, or deter-
mining where the Sun is relative to the spacecraft for accurate attitude determination.

Step 6. Do autonomous vs. ground-based navigation trade. We must determine
whether reducing the long-term, recurring operations cost and risk justifies the cost of
autonomous navigation. Tradition strongly supports ground navigation. This provides
a greater level of comfort to some customers and end users who are concerned prim-
arily that there be no deviation from prior procedures. Irrespective of technical issues,
there is a level of programmatic risk associated with any nontraditional solution. The
issue of autonomous navigation clearly falls in this area, although semi-autonomous
navigation, such as TDRS and GPS, is gaining acceptance.

A key question is whether we need real-time navigation data, either on board the
satellite or for the end user. If we must provide navigation and payload data simulta-
neously, autonomous navigation is highly desirable. The alternative would be to
navigate on the ground and uplink the solutions for use by the spacecraft or to send
them to the end user. This approach makes reliable communications critical. If the
work is done on the ground, then there are two possibilities. It can be done either in
real time, using real-time data from the spacecraft, or it can be done using older data
which is propagated forward to produce a real-time ephemeris. In the past we used
older data because real-time data was not available. TDRS, GPS, GLONASS, and
various autonomous navigation systems now allow us to use real-time data which does
not need to be as accurate as data for propagated solutions.

Step 7. Select a navigation method. Section 11.7.2 summarizes the alternative
spacecraft navigation methods and their advantages and disadvantages.

Step 8. Define requirements for the guidance and navigation.system. We should
define the top-level requirements in terms of what is needed rather than how it is to be
done. Thus, requirements should be expressed in terms of mapping, pointing, con-
stellation maintenance, and level of autonomy rather than the specific navigation
method to be used. While we will go through detailed trades to select the best naviga-
tion method, we should focus on mission objectives to define requirements. This
allows later trades which may either be more detailed or use new information.

11.7.2 Orbit Determination Systems

There are three elements to the orbit determination problem: (1) the source and type
of data, (2) the algorithms for modeling the orbit, and (3) the computer program which
processes the observations. The second and third elements are well established and
will be described only briefly here. I will concentrate on the alternative sources of data
and the advantages and disadvantages of each in an orbit determination system.

The analytical methods for orbit determination are complex but well understood.
They are summarized briefly in Chap. 6 and discussed in detail in several modern
reference works. Vallado [2001], Battin [1999], Chobotov [1991], Escobal [1965],
Noton [1998], and Roy [1991] provide extensive discussions of orbit determination
and orbit propagation methods.

Generally, the various algorithms used for orbit determination are implemented in
a small number of large and complex software systems. The major orbit determination
systems are used for multiple space programs. Perhaps the most frequently used is the
Goddard Trajectory Determination System, GTDS, used by NASA to process data for
nearly all low-Earth orbit satellites [Long et al.,1989]. NORAD and others use a

502 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

similar system for tracking spacecraft based on radar observations. JPL’s Deep Space
Network (DSN) uses a unique and remarkably accurate system to track interplanetary
spacecraft [Jordan, 1981; Miller et al., 1990]. It solves simultaneously for the orbits of
the interplanetary probes and the planets and satellites which they approach. For many
mission analysis purposes, Chap. 6 (or any book on astrodynamics) contains sufficient
information to construct an elementary orbit propagator. Highly precise orbit propaga-
tors are now commercially available.

The observations used for orbit determination can be obtained by tracking from the
ground, tracking from space, or from autonomous or semi-autonomous systems on the
spacecraft. Each of these approaches is described below. Table 11-65 summarizes

Ground-Station Tracking

This is the traditional way to obtain data for orbit determination. We either track the
spacecraft’s telemetry signals or use radar tracking from a site not associated with the
spacecraft. In both cases, the principal data used for orbit determination are range and
range rate—that is, the distance from the ground station to the satellite and the
satellite’s line-of-sight velocity during the overhead pass. Angular measurements are
also available at times but are typically far less accurate than range or range-rate
measurements.

Accurate orbit determination using ground-station data ordinarily requires a
number of passes. We may accumulate data from multiple passes over a single ground
station, or may receive data at a central location from multiple ground stations around
the world. In either case, data from a number of passes goes to one place for processing
through a large system such as GTDS, described above. Ground-based systems neces-
sarily operate on historical data and therefore will use propagated orbits for real-time
operations and mission planning. Accuracies achievable with ground-based tracking
vary with a spacecraft’s orbit and the accuracy and amount of data. However, 30
accuracies typically range from several kilometers for low-Earth orbits to approxi-
mately 50 km for geosynchronous orbit.

TDRS

The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS, has now replaced NASA’s world-
wide ground-tracking network. A major advantage of this system is that the two
operational TDRS satellites can provide tracking data coverage for 85% to 100% of
most low-Earth orbits. (TDRS does not work for satellites in geosynchronous orbit.)
The system collects mostly range and range-rate data from the TDRS satellite to the
satellite being tracked. Angular information is available, but is much less accurate than
the range and range-rate data. If atmospheric drag effects on a satellite are small,
TDRS can achieve 30 accuracies of about 50 m. This is considerably better than most
ground-tracking systems. Another way to track from space is to use satellite-to-
satellite or crosslink tracking as described below.

Spacecraft Autonomous Navigation

As summarized in Table 11-66, manufacturers have developed a number of auton-
omous navigation systems for spacecraft. Determining the orbit on board is technically
easy with the advent of advanced spacecraft computers and higher-order languages.
The principal problem is to provide orbit determination that is reliable, robust, and
economical in terms of both cost and weight. A number of systems which can do this
now exist—autonomous orbit determination is clearly feasible but becoming less
important with the increasing use of GPS for navigation in low-Earth orbit. Wertz
[2001] and Chory et al. [1986] describe alternative methods of autonomous navigation
on board satellites. Table 11-65, earlier in the section, gives the advantages and disad-
vantages of the primary alternatives.

Autonomous navigation is inherently real-time. Thus, definitive orbit solutions and
payload data are available simultaneously, which means that we can generate ground
look-points or target positions and immediately associate them with the payload data.
In addition, measurements can be less accurate than those for systems that work on old
data, because solutions propagated forward in time lose accuracy. For example, to do
accurate orbit maneuvers without autonomous navigation, we need a greater accuracy
from a definitive solution based on old data that must be propagated forward to meet

real-time needs. With real-time systems, highly accurate orbit propagation is less
critical, although we will still need some forward propagation for prediction and
planning.

GPS and GLONASS

The Global Positioning System, also called GPS or Navstar, is a system of
navigation satellites funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and intended explicitly
to allow position determination by very small receivers anywhere on or near the
Earth’s surface. Extensive discussions of GPS and its applications, including signal
structure and processing algorithms, are provided by Parkinson and Spilker [1996],
Leick [1995], Kaplan [1996], and Hofmann-Wellenhof [1997]. GPS receivers are now
readily available and their use is becoming widespread in airplanes, ships, ground
vehicles, and military equipment. The system provides a moderate accuracy signal
(50 m-100 m) for general navigation and a high-accuracy coded signal (15 m) for
military applications. Commercial GPS receivers are now available for spacecraft, and
are gaining in popularity in low-Earth orbit [Wertz, 2001; Chory et al., 1986; Anthony,
1992; Parkinson and Gilbert, 1983; Porter and Hite, 1984].

GPS receivers use signals from four different GPS satellites to solve simulta-
neously for the three components of the observer’s position and the time. This can be
done several times, providing position and velocity data which determines the orbit
elements. The GPS constellation is in a 12 hour orbit at approximately half-
geosynchronous altitude. Because the GPS antennas are designed to provide signals
only in a cone covering the Earth’s surface, coverage drops off rapidly with altitude,
even for satellites in low-Earth orbit [Wertz, 1999]. Nonetheless, both analytic and
experimental studies have been done on using GPS for navigation in orbits as high as
geosynchronous using the spillover of the beam beyond the edge of the Earth’s disk
[Chao, et al., 1992].

The GPS signal can also be used to solve for the attitude of the vehicle on which
the receiver is located. This is done by using multiple GPS antennas which are a
known distance apart and which are attached to a rigid element of the vehicle. By mea-
suring the phase difference between the signal from one GPS satellite arriving at two
antennas, the GPS receiver serves as an interferometer measuring the angle between
the line of sight to the GPS satellite and the line joining the two antennas. The
wavelength of the GPS carrier signal is about 20 cm. Therefore, the accuracy of the
attitude is limited by both the long wavelength and multi-path effects which cause con-
fusion in the identification of the signal coming directly from the GPS satellite. In
practice, spacecraft have been able to achieve on-orbit attitude accuracies on the order
of 0.3 to 0.5 deg.

A number of practical difficulties have prevented GPS receivers from developing
substantial operational utility in space for attitude determination. One problem is that
multi-path effects can cause difficulties in some geometries and the GPS constellation,
by nature, will eventually present most geometrical circumstances to the spacecraft.
Orbit determination is an activity which can be done intermittently without harming
system performance, but attitude determination must be continuous if we are to avoid
a major failure. Consequently, the potential lack of availability of four GPS satellites
for even a short period due to either geometrical circumstances or the outage of one or
more satellites is a major concern for a spacecraft which depends on GPS for attitude
determination. Thus, GPS-based attitude sensors will probably serve principally as
backup, or would require backup systems to prevent major anomalies.

506 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

The global navigation satellite system, GLONASS, is a Russian space-based
navigation system that provides 3-D position, velocity determination and time dis-
semination on a worldwide basis. GLONASS is very similar to GPS. It consists of a
24 satellite constellation at approximately half geosynchronous altitude and provides
accuracies very similar to those of GPS. There are a number of manufacturers of
GLONASS receivers, some of which are combined GPS/GLONASS receivers.

GLONASS is operated by Russia’s Ministry of Defense. Like GPS, it was initiated
in the mid-1970s with military design goals. Also like GPS, the civilian applications
became apparent rapidly and the system is now in use for both civilian and military
purposes. While the end results are very similar, the GLONASS signal structure is
significantly different than that of GPS. Both GLONASS and GPS are available for
use by spacecraft, and many satellite manufacturers are considering the use of either
or both systems for onboard determination of position, velocity, time, and sometimes
attitude. For further information on GLONASS, see, for example, Leick [1995] and
Kaplan [1996].

Space Sextant

The Space Sextant was developed and flight tested in the late 1970s as a means of
autonomous navigation by accurately measuring the angle between a star and the limb
of the Moon [Martin Marietta Aerospace, 1977; Booker, 1978]. The Space Sextant
provides both orbit and attitude information and can work over a very large regime,
including geosynchronous orbit. The Space Sextant unit has been flight qualified;
however, the need for precise telescope measurements makes the instrument rather
heavy and therefore limits its usefulness in many space applications.

Microcosm Autonomous Navigation System

The Microcosm Autonomous Navigation System (MANS) uses observations of the
Earth, Sun, and Moon from a single sensor to provide real-time position and attitude
data [Tai and Noerdlinger, 1989; Anthony, 1992]. These objects were chosen princi-
pally because they can be unambiguously identified with high reliability and low cost
and observations can be done with minor modifications to attitude sensors already ‘on
most spacecraft. The MANS flight software can also make use of, but does not require,
data from a GPS receiver, star sensors, gyros, and accelerometers. The addition of
other data sources provides added accuracy but is not required by the system. In addi-
tion to orbit and attitude, MANS provides ground look point and Sun direction
information (even when the Sun is not visible to the sensor). It can work at any attitude
and any orbit from LEO to beyond GEO. MANS was flight tested on the TAOS
mission launched in 1994 [Hosken and Wertz, 1995].

Stellar-Horizon Systems

A number of approaches for orbit and attitude determination have been proposed,
based on the interaction of starlight with the Earth’s atmosphere [Hummel, 1984].
Specifically, as stars approach the edge of the Earth as seen from the spacecraft,
refraction will cause their position relative to other stars to shift, producing an effect
which can be measured with considerable accuracy. Theoretical accuracies for such
systems are projected to be in the vicinity of 100 m. However, none of these systems
has been fully developed for flight as yet.

Satellite Crosslinks
A number of proposals have been made for using satellite crosslinks to provide
orbit determination [Chory et al., 1984]. This is of interest because it can be done with

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 507

crosslink equipment used for intersatellite communication, and, therefore, requires
minimal] additional hardware. Crosslink tracking has been proposed for a number of
constellations, but tends not to be implemented because of several practical problems.
One problem is that satellite-to-satellite tracking provides only the relative positions
of the satellites in the constellation. This means that if the absolute position is needed
for any purpose such as mission planning or data reduction, then an additional system
must be provided to establish the orbit relative to the Earth’s surface. A second
problem is that the satellites become interdependent, so satellite-to-satellite tracking
may not work well for the first satellites or may degrade if a satellite stops working.
Therefore, an alternative system not based on satellite-to-satellite tracking is required.
If additional systems must be provided, there is less benefit from the satellite-to-
satellite tracking.

Landmark Tracking

Landmark tracking has also been proposed for orbit determination [Markley,
1981]. This has been established as feasible by using data returned from satellite
payloads. However, it has not been used as a normal method for satellite navigation,
due in part to the difficulty of establishing automatic, unambiguous identification of
landmarks to ensure that tracking accuracy can be maintained in the presence of
adverse weather or poor seeing conditions.

Earth and Star Sensing

The combination of Earth and star sensing works similarly to sensing the Earth,
Sun, and Moon [Wertz, 2001]. The direction and distance to the Earth are sensed
relative to the inertia] frame of the fixed stars. This is then used to directly determine
the direction and distance to the spacecraft. The Earth and stars are available nearly
continuously in any Earth orbit and star identification is becoming less of a problem
with the introduction of substantially better computers for space use.

11.7.3 Orbit Maintenance and Control

Chapter 6 presented relevant AV equations for orbit maintenance and control. This
section discusses when orbit control is necessary and what options are available to do
it. Section 2.1.2 discusses autonomous orbit maintenance as part of a fully autonomous
spacecraft.

Most small spacecraft do not require orbit control and have no onboard propulsion.
This has the advantage of eliminating one spacecraft subsystem and, therefore, reduc-
ing the spacecraft’s cost, weight, and complexity. However, once the spacecraft has
separated from the launch vehicle or upper stage, no further control of the satellite
orbit is possible and the satellite will be subject to drag and orbit decay in low-Earth
orbit and to cumulative secular perturbations in all orbits. Usually, this is only accept-
able for satellites that will last from 1 to 3 years but may be suitable for longer periods
in some cases. For example, the Voyager spacecraft, having left the solar system, will
be uncontrolled indefinitely. The only real objective, however, is to maintain commu-
nications and, to some degree, sample the interstellar medium.

We can also adjust a spacecraft’s orbit using other means than onboard propulsion,
such as the Orbiter or an orbit-transfer vehicle or tug. For example, with the Space
Telescope, the Orbiter is used for both instrument replacement and to return the
Telescope to a higher altitude.

508 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

Orbit control is needed when any of the following are required:

* Targeting to achieve an end orbit or position—as in satellite rendezvous or
interplanetary missions

¢ To overcome secular orbit perturbations—such as altitude maintenance in
low-Earth orbit or geosynchronous stationkeeping

¢ To maintain relative orientations—as in constellation maintenance

Each of these is discussed briefly below. An orbit lifetime of more than | to 3 years
usually demands some type of orbit maintenance or control.

Targeting to achieve a particular orbit or location in space is the most common
reason for orbit control. Typically, we achieve the orbit objectives with one or two
large maneuvers, using several small maneuvers in between or for final adjustments.
For example, in transfer to geosynchronous orbit, an initial large maneuver occurs at
perigee in low-Earth orbit. A second large maneuver follows at apogee near geosyn-
chronous altitude. Finally, several small orbit maneuvers over an extended period
place the satellite in its final position. This has been traditionally been done by using
large, high-thmist engines for the major maneuvers and smaller engines for orbit
adjustments. However, as described in more detail in Sec. 7.5, low-thrust engines can
often be used efficiently for large AVs. This normally means smaller, lighter, less-
expensive engines and much smaller, simpler control systems. Propulsive maneuvers
usually are the largest attitude disturbance on the spacecraft and, therefore, affect the
size of the required attitude control system. Small thrusters can reduce the weight,
complexity, and cost of other components as well as the propulsion system itself.

We often associate major orbit changes with the early phases of a mission, but they
can occur throughout the life of the spacecraft. For example, most geosynchronous
spacecraft can be shifted so that the longitude of the spacecraft is adjusted to meet
changing needs. Spacecraft can also be retargeted to achieve new objectives, such as
the retargeting of the ISEE-C spacecraft to rendezvous with Comet Giacobini-Zinner
in 1985. The need for maneuvers of this type may arise after the spacecraft has been
launched. They are not planned in advance but simply take advantage of existing
resources. Finally, as described in Sec. 21.2, it is becoming more critical to use an end-
of-life maneuver for spacecraft disposal either in low-Earth orbit or in geosynchronous
orbit. These maneuvers are used either to have the spacecraft reenter in a location that
is not hazardous, or put the spacecraft in an orbit where it will not harm other space-
craft. While not important during the early years of space exploration, the requirement
to maintain a clean space environment will become much more stringent in the future.

We must also maintain the orbit to overcome long-term secular perturbations, as
described in detail in Chap. 6. All geosynchronous spacecraft require orbit mainte-
nance in the East-West direction to avoid interference and possible collisions with
other spacecraft. Furthermore, most use orbit maintenance in a North-South direction
to maintain a near-zero inclination. In low-Earth orbit, altitude maintenance is used to
overcome atmospheric drag and achieve a longer working life. Other orbit types, such
as Sun-synchronous or repeating ground track, may also require orbit maintenance.

Nearly all constellations require some type of orbit maintenance to prevent
collisions between satellites and maintain the constellation pattern over time. In prin-
ciple, we could use relative stationkeeping in which we maintain the relative positions
between satellites but not their absolute position. In practice, however, this will make
orbit maintenance more complex and will not save propellant or reduce the number of

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 509

computations. In a low-Earth orbit constellation with relative orbit maintenance, we
would, in principle, maintain all satellites in the constellation to decay at the same rate
as the slowest-decaying satellite at any time. But the entire constellation would still
decay in this process. Therefore, it would slowly change its altitude and need to be
reboosted at some later time.

The alternative is absolute stationkeeping, shown in Fig. 11-51. Here, we maintain
each spacecraft within a mathematically defined box moving with the constellation
pattern. As long as we maintain the constellation’s altitude, absolute stationkeeping is
just as efficient as relative stationkeeping. All in-track stationkeeping maneuvers are
done firing in the direction of motion to put energy taken out by atmospheric drag back
into the orbit. We put in more or less energy at any given time, depending upon the
amount of drag and the atmospheric density, as described in Sec. 8.1.5.

Fig. 11-51. Constellation Stationkeeping Maintains Each Satellite in a “Box” Rotating with
the Constellation.

The amount of drag makeup for any satellite in a constellation depends on the
satellite’s observed drift relative to its assigned box. At the forward edge of the box,
the applied AV is increased, thus increasing the orbit altitude and period and sliding
the satellite rearward in phase relative to the box. Similarly, at the trailing edge, the
applied AV is decreased, thus decreasing the altitude and period and sliding the satel-
lite forward in phase. Because of the high spacecraft velocities in low-Earth orbit,
timekeeping is critical to maintaining the satellites’ relative positions. A 1 sec differ-
ence in the time corresponds to a 7 km difference in in-track position. Maintaining the
same time throughout the constellation is important, but not difficult.

Although the perturbative forces are different, constellation maintenance in
low-Earth orbit is analogous to stationkeeping in geosynchronous orbit. In-track
and cross-track orbit maintenance in low-Earth orbit correspond to East-West and
North-South stationkeeping, respectively, in geosynchronous orbit. Because the forces
involved are different, the correspondence is not exact. Altitude maintenance is
necessary in low-Earth orbit to overcome the effect of atmospheric drag. In geosyn-

510 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

chronous orbit, this would correspond to maintaining the mean drift rate relative to the
surface of the Earth at zero, so the stationkeeping box stays over a fixed location. In
low-Earth orbit, this corresponds to maintaining the box at a mathematically fixed po-
sition in the constellation.

Ground-Based vs. Autonomous Orbit Control

Traditionally, orbit maintenance and control are executed from the ground. The re-
quired orbit adjustment will be computed at the ground station, and a series of
commands will be generated which are uploaded to the spacecraft and then down-
linked for verification. Finally, the ground station sends a command to execute the
control commands, and the spacecraft carries them out based on an onboard clock.
This sequence protects the spacecraft against communications errors and allows
maneuvers when the spacecraft is out of sight of the ground station. The spacecraft is
often out of sight because orbit maneuvers are usually 180 deg out of phase from the
desired result. For example, in landing on the Moon, the principal burns bring the
spacecraft down to the Earth-facing side of the Moon and take the returning astronauts
back to Earth. Both burns occur on the far side of the Moon, entirely out of sight of the
Earth.

In normal geosynchronous stationkeeping the spacecraft is allowed to drift to one
side of the stationkeeping box. A maneuver then changes its velocity so it will drift
across the box and back before needing another maneuver. This is similar to keeping
a ball in the air by continuously hitting it upward with a paddle. The main reason for
this sequence is that it maximizes the time interval between maneuvers and, therefore,
minimizes the amount of ground operations, which carry the potential for communi-
cations errors or command mistakes.

In the past, there was no realistic alternative to orbit control from the ground. Now,
however, autonomous navigation systems have made autonomous orbit maintenance
possible, economical, and safe. Autonomous orbit maintenance drives down the cost
and risk of missions by having a major part of the day-to-day operations on board the
spacecraft. As described in Sec. 2.1.2, autonomous orbit maintenance is a key compo-
nent in a fully autonomous spacecraft bus, which can further reduce mission costs.
(For further discussion of autonomous orbit control, see Wertz [1996, 2001], Wertz,
et al. [1997], K6nigsmann, et al. [1996], Collins, et al. [1996], or Glickman [1994].)
Microcosm has developed a commercial, autonomous Orbit Control Kit flight soft-
ware system scheduled for flight validation on UoSAT-12 in 1999. This and other
approaches are also scheduled to be flight tested later on EO-1 which is intended to do
formation flying with LandSat-7.

Orbit and attitude control are analogous, with several important differences.
Typically, we must control attitude moderately often or continuously if we are to avoid
serious consequences. A satellite that loses attitude control will usually tumble and
then lose the payload function, power on the solar arrays, and contact with the ground.
It also may point sensitive instruments at the Sun or have substantial thermal
problems. Even a brief attitude control failure can destroy the mission. In contrast,
orbit control maneuvers occur infrequently, and any computer that can do autonomous
navigation will easily accommodate the necessary additional computations. As long as
we control the orbit with low-thrust systems (Secs. 7.5, 17.4), a short-term failure will
cause:no damage. Gravity takes care of short-term orbit control very well. If the
orbit-control system fails, the ground or the onboard system will determine that the
Satellite is slowly drifting from its assigned slot and a warning can be issued with

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 511

adequate time to fix the problem or implement a back-up before adverse consequences
occur.

With autonomous orbit maintenance we can optimize characteristics other than the
time between maneuvers, such as the size of the control box. Just as we would not
ordinarily implement attitude control to minimize the number of commands sent to the
momentum wheel, we do not have to minimize the number of thruster firings so long
as the duty cycle is within the range of the thrusters and the thruster pulses are long
enough to achieve high efficiency. Ordinarily using many short pulses is not a
problem, as thrusters are frequently used for attitude control and small thrusters have
lifetimes far in excess of the required number of on-off cycles.

For some missions, autonomous orbit control is required simply because of the
nature of the mission itself. This is the case for planetary flybys or a mission to the far
side of the Moon in which either the spacecraft is out of contact or the communications
delays are too long for normal ground control. Generally, ground stations do the orbit-
control computations and upload them to the spacecraft for execution at a later time.
This is a semi-autonomous approach which can meet mission requirements while
maintaining ground control.

In geosynchronous stationkeeping, the main reason for autonomous orbit main-
tenance is to reduce operations cost and risk, rather than a specific technical
requirement.” For a constellation at any altitude, the overall process of orbit determi-
nation and control represents a major operational cost. It also represents a significant
risk element in which any operational error or failure of the ground system could dam-
age or destroy the constellation. The orbit maintenance operation is necessarily carried
out on board the spacecraft by firing thrusters. Performing the control computations
on board the spacecraft can reduce both cost and risk. First, it eliminates the potential
for operator error in a very repetitive function. Second, it reduces communication
errors or failures frequently associated with operational activities.

The argument has been made that autonomous orbit control is a range-safety
concern because having a spacecraft adjust its orbit without operator oversight could
endanger other spacecraft or people. This is a reasonable concern for firing high-
thrust, large AV engines, but it is not a problem for low-thrust maintenance. A watch-
dog timer can easily limit the propulsive burn time to keep burns small. Even if the
watchdog system fails, the amount of propellant in most low-thrust systems is too low
to endanger other space systems or people on the ground.

The principal reason for not undertaking autonomous orbit maintenance and
control for future missions is tradition. It has not been done that way in the past, and
there is a very strong desire in expensive space missions to maintain those procedures
that have worked previously. A mechanism for overcoming this potential risk is super-
vised autonomy in which orbit maintenance maneuvers are computed on board the
spacecraft and verification from the ground is required before they are executed. This
allows mission personnel to gain confidence in the onboard computations before
permitting fully autonomous operation.

A second alternative is to implement “autonomous orbit maintenance” from the
ground. In this case, the computations would be done autonomously, but would be

* A technical requirement for autonomous orbit maintenance can arise in geosynchronous
stationkeeping when there is a desire to place additional satellites in a narrow orbit slot. In this
case, autonomous orbit maintenance is needed to reduce the size of the orbit-control dead-
band, which would be impractical if we had to do frequent commanding from the ground.

512 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7

done at the ground station and then sent to the spacecraft for execution. This has the
advantage of maintaining some characteristics of traditional orbit maintenance and
also minimizes the amount of hardware on board the spacecraft. Unfortunately, this
approach can add significant complexity and risk to the mission. If the navigation data
is obtained on board the spacecraft, it would need to be communicated to the ground
for processing. Then, the results and commands would go to the spacecraft and be ver-
ified for later execution. This makes the process much more complex and increases the
potential for communications errors and transmitting the wrong data to the wrong
spacecraft. Most likely, these disadvantages would outweigh any advantage of doing
the small amount of command processing on the ground. If the spacecraft has enough
computing power on board, a reasonable alternative might be to compute the orbit con-
trol on board the spacecraft and send it to the ground for verification and approval
before actually executing the command. This allows full ground override. It also
allows the system to use an on-orbit process with less cost and higher reliability, when-
ever operators are confident that the system is working smoothly.

If the spacecraft navigation is done with the traditional approach of tracking from
the ground, doing the commanding from the ground and uploading commands to the
spacecraft is an efficient alternative and minimizes the overall communication prob-
lem. In this case, the traditional cost and complexity of orbit maintenance from the
ground remain, although it may be possible to reduce this somewhat with more
automation.

Autonomous navigation and orbit contro! can significantly reduce the cost of space
operations. For most space missions, this is a major cost. It should also reduce risk
because there are fewer failure modes than with operator-driven or ground-based
systems. For modern spacecraft, almost no one would recommend doing attitude
determination and control from the ground, even though this is a more complex task
with more serious adverse consequences than orbit control. The main argument
against autonomous orbit determination and control is tradition—we have not done it
that way in the past and, therefore, should not do it in the future.

11.7.4 Sizing Autonomous Guidance and Navigation

The implementation of a purely ground-based guidance and navigation system is
both expensive and straightforward. This is the traditional approach, and is described
in detail in Chap. 14. The process is well established for geosynchronous spacecraft,
low-Earth orbit spacecraft, and interplanetary missions.

The main reason for considering autonomous guidance and navigation is to reduce
mission cost and risk. But we can also extend mission life, put more spacecraft into a
geosynchronous slot, or undertake missions which we could not realistically do with-
out some autonomy.

Orbit and attitude sensing and control are strongly interrelated. In many cases, they
will use the same sensors and the same actuators. The attitude control sensors and
actuators will need to control the spacecraft during orbit maneuvers, which will prob-
ably be the largest source of disturbance torques during the spacecraft’s operating life.
In addition, orbit and attitude budgets are often combined to produce pointing and
mapping budgets to satisfy mission requirements (see Fig. 4-6 and Sec. 5-4). Our goal
should be to reduce the total cost and risk of attitude and orbit determination and
control. (For an extended discussion of this objective, see Wertz [2001].)

In most cases, we would meet our objective of minimum cost, weight, and risk by
combining elements of orbit and attitude determination and control. Unfortunately,

11.7 Guidance and Navigation 513

this may be difficult to achieve in practice. Traditionally, attitude determination and
control is the responsibility of a controls organization, and is a well-defined element
of the spacecraft bus. Orbit determination and control, on the other hand, is usually the
responsibility of a systems organization which will ultimately implement this function
on the ground. The guidance and navigation function is ordinarily not allocated weight
or power on board the spacecraft and is not considered a normal spacecraft function.
This chapter contains separate sections on the attitude control system and the guidance
and navigation system because these are normally separate functions. Getting these
functions to work together is perhaps the single largest hurdle in developing autono-
mous navigation and orbit control and, therefore, fully autonomous spacecraft.

The problem of combining orbit and attitude systems is illustrated by Table 11-67,
which provides size, weight, and power for alternative autonomous navigation sys-
tems. Several of the systems, such as the GPS receivers, are orbit-only, although in the
future they may be expanded to include attitude as well. Other systems, such as MANS
and the Space Sextant, do both the attitude and orbit function. In these cases, one
should look at the difference in weight and power required to achieve navigation from
that required for attitude alone. Even this assessment is complicated because orbit
determination requires computer resources which may be regarded as a part of the
attitude control system, the navigation system, the command and data handling sys-
tem, or the general spacecraft computer. For many of the systems, such as landmark
tracking or crosslink navigation, the computer is the principal element associated with

514 Spacecraft Subsystems

autonomous navigation and control. The main message is to avoid “double booking”
components for guidance and navigation and to look at the joint implementation of
orbit and attitude determination and control when beginning to optimize system
performance.

Autonomous navigation and orbit maintenance is too new to have a standard imple-
mentation in terms of where computations are done. But the nature of the
computations themselves and the data used suggest a natural configuration: using a
single spacecraft processor for determining and controlling the attitude and orbit.
These functions will probably use either the same or similar sensors and may use the
same actuators. Most of the computing is associated with sensor processing, data
handling, and anomaly resolution. The orbit and attitude computations themselves are
normally much smaller. The implementation of either orbit or attitude control
algorithms represents by far the smallest part of the throughput requirement. Thus,
control adds little burden for any processor which is already determining the orbit or
attitude.

A reasonable initial design would incorporate all of these functions in a single
spacecraft processor. Actual implementation may vary, depending upon the specific
hardware and software. For example, star-sensor processing may be incorporated
within the star sensor itself, or may be done in the same processor as other orbit or
attitude functions. The overall objective, however, should continue to be to minimize
the cost and risk of determining and controlling the orbit and attitude for the entire
mission.
