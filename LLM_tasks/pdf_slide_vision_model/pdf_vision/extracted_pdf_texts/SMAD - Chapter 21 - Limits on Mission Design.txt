21.1 Law and Policy Considerations

William B. Wirin, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs

Why Worry About Law and Policy?

Engineers accustomed to precise answers often find that legal and political issues
intrude on the space mission design process just when everything is going smoothly.
However, I hope to shed some light on potential policy “show stoppers,” and more
importantly, provide some insight into legal thinking about space missions and valid,
even critical, perils in the design process.

Policy results from balancing conflicting interests, so “valid” arguments may be
rejected. Lawyers tend to give “answers” rather than an evaluation of political and
legal risks. They unfairly believe that individuals from other disciplines will not
understand and appreciate the balancing of interests. General James V. Hartinger, first
Commander of Space Command, put it succinctly, “Lawyers are asked common sense
questions so often that they begin to believe they have common sense.” The mission
planner should look to lawyers to evaluate policy and legal risks for various mission
alternatives so they can be weighed along with technical factors.

Why worry about law and policy? The simple answer is that a perfect engineering
solution is useless until it can be implemented. An example is the Apstar satellite. It
was launched in July 1994 by the PRC without obtaining coordination from “owners”
of nearby communications satellites as required by the International Telegraphic
Union (ITU) regulations. Without the required consultations the satellite would not be
permitted to transmit signals and therefore would be of little value. The result was a
flurry of activity to conclude the negotiations quickly and this was accomplished a few
months after launch. Had this been a U.S. launch it would have been postponed until
the proper authorizations were accomplished, resulting in needless expense.

Another example is the Shuttle mission 51C to retrieve the Palapa and Westar VI
satellites. These satellites remained in low-Earth orbit because the motors which
should have transferred them to geostationary orbit failed. Hughes and NASA engi-
neers worked out the technical solutions in a little more than 6 weeks. The lawyers
spent more than 6 months resolving the legal questions concerning ownership, salvage
rights, insurance coverages, and release of liability between the insurance carriers,
Western Union Company and the Indonesian government. Also Hughes Aircraft
Company and NASA had to agree on technical roles, liability, and compensation
before the recovery effort began.

Without the implementing legislation in the Commercial Space Act of 1998 the
DOT was not authorized to license private organizations to conduct space operations
which included reentry of reusable space vehicles. This is a vital provision not only for
NASA's X-33 and X-34 programs, but for companies building commercial reusable
launch vehicles which will need to renter the Earth's atmosphere after delivering their
payloads to orbit. Moreover the law is now clear that launch and recovery by definition
are not an export or import. The first private launch of the Conestoga downrange to
Matagorda Island off Texas required an export license in addition to other licenses.
These additions to the law make way for commercial exploitation of new space oppor-
tunities and begin to strip away some restrictions on space activity.

21.1.1 Space Law

For a multinational project such as a space station, mission designers must recog-
nize that lawyers from some nations approach policy and legal issues differently.
England and her progeny are common law nations; all others are civil law nations. The
latter seek to establish civil codes of law which in effect create all of the rules up front.
Common law nations, in contrast, see law as evolving to solve particular problems.
They look to past precedent and attempt to fashion a modern answer, while civil law
judges apply the code and leave “changes” to legislators.

An interesting example of space law is that spacecraft have the right to pass over
the territory and air space of other nations without their consent, whereas aircraft do
not. But no one has defined where space begins. The Russians proposed 100-110 km
because aircraft presently cannot fly at that altitude, and space objects burn up in the
atmosphere below it. The U.S. position is to wait to see how technology will develop
since there have been no particular problems. Equatorial nations have argued in vain
that their sovereignty goes up to ~36,000 km (geostationary orbit) so they can control
access and obtain compensation from space-faring nations who use slots above their
territory.

Space missions are inherently an international activity, because space touches the
sovereign territory of every nation on Earth. We must, therefore, consider diverse
views on space issues. For example, space-faring nations may diverge from the feel-
ings of developing nations, or Eastern and Western nations may disagree. Differences
of opinions can arise from different cultures, economic status, political imperatives,
and world view.

International law, including space law, evolves in part from treaties, including the
U.N. Charter and U.N. resolutions plus organic documents of international organiza-
tions. It also depends on the practice of nations, as well as the writings of established
authorities. Unlike U.S. domestic law, space law has no legislature to write the rules
and no court to enforce them. Sovereign nations enter into treaties but may disregard

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 823

them when they no longer serve their national security needs. The U.N. may pass
resolutions, but they are not absolutely binding even when unanimous. Besides,
treaties tend to have ambiguous language, permitting a nation to pursue its best inter-
ests. An example is Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, which says that the Moon
and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for “peaceful purposes,” whatever
that means.

The International Court at the Hague does hand-down decisions, but nations must
usually agree to have the Court hear the case. Even when they do, there is no effective
mechanism to enforce a decision. Having said all this, we must not conclude that space
law has no value. There is a body of rules and a general understanding among nations
as to what is proper and improper in space. Nevertheless, even though they may be
ambiguous and no policeman enforces them, treaties are seldom if ever ignored.

Basic Do’s and Don’ts: The Outer Space Treaty of 1967*

As the so-called Principles Treaty, this document lays down the basic philosophy
and legal principles for outer space. In general, it says what should or should not be
done, but does not spell out how to implement a given policy. Its preamble emphasizes
that international cooperation is essential and recognizes that exploring space is in the
common interest of all mankind. It goes further to declare that exploration should
benefit all peoples. Provisions of the treaty include:

¢ Allnations may scientifically investigate space, with international cooperation
encouraged.

¢ No nation may claim sovereignty over outer space, including the Moon and
other celestial bodies. As an illustration, Neil Armstrong claimed the Moon for
mankind (not the United States) by stating that the mission had taken “One
small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.” The American flag was
present, but not to claim new territory, as Columbus and other explorers did
when they came to the New World.

¢ The rules in space will follow the established principles and rules of interna-
tional law and the U.N. Charter.

¢ No nation will place nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruc-
tion in orbit around the Earth, or on the Moon, or on other celestial bodies. This
restriction does not apply to nuclear power sources. The Treaty Banning
Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water
(August 5, 1963) prohibits tests but not placement of nuclear devices in space.

* Nations must use the Moon and other celestial bodies exclusively for “peaceful
purposes,” but they may use military personnel in scientific research. The U.S.
defines peaceful as “non-aggressive,” thus permitting defensive measures.

¢ Astronauts are envoys of mankind. So long as they conform to accepted rules
of activity in space, they have a form of immunity. Therefore, we must return
them to their home nation promptly, and implicitly, may not charge to rescue
them. The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts,

* The classic treatise on space policy is by Professor Carl Q. Christol, The Modern International
Law of Outer Space, Pergamon Press, New York (1982). Other material is in the annual
reports of the Colloquium on the Law of Outer Space, by the International Institute of Space
Law, published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Washington, DC.

824

Limits on Mission Design 21.1

and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (April 22, 1968) could
also apply.

Recovered space objects must go back to the launching nation at its request
and expense.

Nations bear international responsibility for their activities in outer space,
whether done by governmental agencies or private citizens. Thus, the U.S.
must authorize and continuously supervise all space activities of its citizens.
This requirement is unique to space activities, resulting from a compromise
between the U.S. and the former USSR. The USSR had insisted that only
governments should be permitted to go into space, whereas the U.S. insisted
on permission for private entrepreneurs. The Commercial Launch Act of 1984
was enacted partly to carry out the U.S. obligations under the 1967 Outer
Space Treaty. It has been amended from time to time to update policies and
procedures.

Launching nations are liable for damages to citizens of other nations caused by
national and private launch activities. The Convention on International Liabil-
ity for Damage Caused by Space Objects (March 29, 1972) could also apply.

Nations must maintain a register of their launches. The purpose is to establish
ownership, jurisdiction, and control over the spacecraft and its personnel. In
essence, a U.S. spacecraft or space station is its sovereign territory. Other
nations retain jurisdiction over their spacecraft and modules even when
attached to another’s station. Space debris falls in the same category, making
clean-up politically difficult. Launches are also reported to the U.N. to provide
an opportunity for the world community to learn about space activity. If a sat-
ellite or other space object were not registered, it would be considered a rogue
and likely forfeit any legitimate status and protection under the Outer Space
Treaty or international law. It would be awkward to put in a claim for damage
to such a satellite under the liability convention. A nation that chooses for any
reason not to play by the rules, cannot easily demand their enforcement. Of
course, policy and politics would also restrain it from complaining.

The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space
(January 4, 1975) requires a launching nation to advise the U.N. Secretary
General of the following: name of the launching nation, description or regis-
tration number, date and location of launch, basic orbital parameters (nodal
period, inclination, apogee, and perigee) and general function of the space
object. A nation need not update this information but may do so if it wishes.

Nations must conduct space activities so as to avoid harming or contaminating
the environment. Project West Ford influenced this provision. In 1963, the
U.S. placed 480 million copper dipoles into orbit 2,000 miles above the Earth
in an attempt to create an artificial ionosphere to enable radio messages to
bounce from coast to coast. The in-house name for the project was Needles,
which was an unfortunate choice. Complaints came from astronomers who
were convinced the belt of copper needles would ruin their view of the uni-
verse. They also thought it might lead to worse experiments. The Soviets said,
“What if one of the needles pierces the heart of a cosmonaut or puts out some-
one’s eye when it reenters the atmosphere?” Although these objections were

211 Law and Policy Considerations 825

not reasonable, public ignorance made them real. Simply put, even though the
project caused no significant problems, the planners had failed to consider
fully the effects of adverse public opinion. A key question you won’t find writ-
ten anywhere is, “Does it pass the common sense test?” Project West Ford
failed. Space law now requires that if a project might cause harm or interfer-
ence with others, international consultations must occur before it proceeds (see
Sec. 21.1.6 on Environmental Concerns). Planners should also review the
Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any Other Hostile Use of
Environmental Modification Techniques (May 18, 1977) if they anticipate
large-scale effects.

Nuclear reactors in space create an environmental concern because they cause
gamma-ray interference with some scientific satellites. NASA’s Solar Maxi-
mum Mission is a case in point; its gamma-ray spectrometer suffered interfer-
ence from reactors on Soviet radar satellites for ocean reconnaissance
(RORSATs). If we plan a project such as the Gamma Ray Observatory, we
must evaluate precautions and risks. At the same time, if we plan to use a
nuclear power source for a mission, we must consider possible effects and
protests. Some legislators in the U.S. have proposed a ban on the use of
nuclear power sources in space. Although Congress is not likely to pass such a
measure, the proposed ban illustrates environmental concerns.

* Stations on the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be open mutually to
representatives of other nations after reasonable advance notice. Even this
general language does not apply in space to space stations, shuttles, platforms,
or satellites. Neither by treaty, international law, nor custom may anyone
inspect sovereign facilities in space. Although the U.S. may agree to inspec-
tions on the Moon, Russia has taken a very stern stand against inspections;
therefore, in my opinion, these inspections are unlikely. The Antarctic Treaty,
in contrast, allows unannounced inspection of stations, installations, and
equipment; therefore we must not confuse these provisions with those of the
Outer Space Treaty. The Antarctic Treaty permits unconditional free access at
all times. This could change if there were more than scientific interest in
Antarctica. The Moon Treaty of 1979 has extensive inspection provisions but
little force or effect, because no space-faring nation of the West or East ratified
it. The “common heritage of mankind” provisions, which envision sharing
profits with all nations even though they have not contributed, is a major stick-
ing point.

Conflicts Between U.S. Law and International Law

Federal statutes and treaties are of equal authority. If a statute and a treaty conflict,
the later in time controls (87 Corpus Juris Segundum Treaties 89). Therefore, statutes
and regulations may control the activities of U.S. industry and government, even to the
extent of revoking portions of an earlier international agreement or treaty.

Satellite Telecommunications. Communications have been the most commercially
profitable use of space, with primary applications in telephone, telegraph, television,
and data transmissions. The unique properties of the stationary orbit over the equator,
which permits stationary positioning of a satellite, make it a limited natural resource.
Space at 35,680 km above the Earth is ample to accommodate many satellites with
little risk of collision. But the radio frequency and its bandwidth limit spacing to 2 deg

826 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

in order to avoid interference. Reducing this spacing further will be expensive. The
ITU authorizes and controls the effective use of geostationary orbits and frequencies.
Under the International Telecommunication Convention and Final Protocol (Nairobi,
1982) and the ITU’s radio regulations, the system uses a “first-come, first-served”
procedure; once a satellite is registered with the ITU no subsequent system may inter-
fere with its signal transmission. Generally, a similar replacement will retain the rights
of a registered satellite.

A number of concerns over allocation of slots led to a call for a Space World
Administrative Radio Conference in 1985, which reconvened in 1988 and 1992. In
particular, developing nations worried that no slots would be left for them. A compro-
mise left the conventional part of C and Ku radio frequency bands allocated only to
the Fixed Satellite Service on a “first-come, first-served” basis. At the same time, all
nations could obtain orbital slots and frequency channels on the expansion part of the
Service’s frequency bands. Policies set up at the first two WARCs began to be im-
plemented at the most recent conference. However, it was also apparent that this
implementation will continue to evolve as power shifts among participants. The
nations also occasionally hold multilateral planning meetings to resolve area con-
flicts between themselves. Access to all other radio frequency bands allocated to all
other satellite services is still “first-come, first-served” except the 12 GHz and 17 GHz
bands for Broadcasting Satellite Service.

In exercising its registration function, the International Frequency Registration
Board does not evaluate the particular nation’s reasons for making a particular assign-
ment. The Board seeks only to ensure that the national assignment conforms to iden-
tified services for the assigned frequency and that transmissions do not interfere with
other broadcasts. Nations then determine how they will parcel out the allocated
frequencies to their people.

If a proposed satellite could cause interference, the sponsoring nation resolves
issues under negotiation procedures established by the ITU. The ITU conducts much
of its technical activities through the International Frequency Registration Board and
the International Radio Consultative Committee. Since 1973, orbital positions have
been associated with particular frequencies and technical characteristics.

In the U.S., the FCC allocates orbital slots and frequencies. To obtain an orbital
position or frequency, your legal department’s FCC expert submits a formal applica-
tion. The approval process may take 3 to 5 years for a new communications service or
up to a year for an existing satellite.

An ongoing concern is the need to protect the GPS spectrum from disruption and
interference. The Europeans at the World Administrative Conference in 1997 sought
to overlay a commercial broadcast signal on the public service radionavigation band.
This issue was addressed in the Commercial Space Policy Act of 1998 with the Con-
gress encouraging regional agreements with foreign countries, like the 1998 agree-
ment with Japan, in order to make the U.S. GPS signal a globally accepted standard.

Commercial Launches, Commercial launch planners must consider the Commer-
cial Launch Act of 1984. As amended, it requires the DOT to approve and license all
commercial expendable vehicles if launched from U.S. territory or by a U.S. citizen or
corporation outside the U.S.

As the Federal Register indicates, before issuing a launch license the DOT requires
both a mission review and a safety review. The first review focuses on the payload
itself and the flight plan to ensure that the mission is in accord with U.S. policy and
meets U.S. responsibilities under international treaties. Regulations require the DOT

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 827

to review how missions affect national interests. Although some fear this authority will
be used to block missions, Congress has declared privately conducted commercial
launches to be consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the
US. Time will tell what limitations will be imposed, but the Commercial Launch Act
thus far gives government considerable power over commercial activity.

The DOT also reviews procedures for launch safety, including:

¢ Procedures for safety controls for launch sites and flight corridors
¢ Range safety expertise

¢ Procedures for ground and flight safety

* Range tracking and instrumentation

* Vehicle safety systems

* Proposed vehicle design

For the foreseeable future, I expect this review to be conservative. Missions using
proven government launchers and national launching facilities should receive quick
approval. But a mission proposing to use a new and untested vehicle or launch site will
suffer close scrutiny.

DOT must coordinate commercial launches with all other interested agencies in the
Federal Government, particularly the DoD and the Department of State. For current
guidelines, contact the FAA.

The policy is now to require maximum utilization of commercial launch capability
by the federal government. This includes planning missions in such a way so that they
match the space transportation capabilities of our commercial launch providers. The
main exceptions are national security or international collaborative efforts relating to
Science or technology. Congress additionally mandated in the Commercial Space Act
of 1998 that DoD study Vandenberg AFB and Cape Canaveral Air Station to see what
upgrades are needed to enable a flourishing commercial launch industry.

Military Space Activities. The development, testing, and deployment of a space-
based defensive system must abide by the terms of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Limita-
tions Treaty between the U.S. and the USSR (October 3, 1972). Administration policy
will determine whether the U.S. will develop this system.

We also must acknowledge the possibility that international partners of the U.S.
may object to legitimate national security activity. For example, our allies who signed
up to help us develop the Space Station took exception to its potential undefined DoD
activities, which they took to be SDI activities. Canada announced it would withdraw
support for Space Station Freedom if the U.S. chose to conduct military activities,
unless those activities were limited to research.

Patent Issues. Patent law and intellectual property rights in the U.S. stem from the
first national patent law enacted in 1790. It was based upon the U.S. Constitution
(1787), article 1, section 8, paragraph 8 that states, “Congress shall have power to. . .
promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors
and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.” That
limited period in the U.S. is now 20 years from the date of filing for the patent with the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

The U.S. law did not cover “space” so the U.S. Space Bill was enacted in 1990. It
provides that, “Any invention made, used or sold in outer space on a space object of
component thereof under the jurisdiction or control of the United States shall be
considered to be made, used or sold within the United States.” This legislation follows

828 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

the “flagship” principle, which applies U.S. laws to ships on the high seas and aircraft
flying over international water. With regard to the International Space Station, the
International Governmental Agreement provides “... for purposes of intellectual
property law, an activity occurring in or on a Space Station flight element shall be
deemed to have occurred only in the territory of the Partner State of that element’s reg-
istry, except that for ESA-registered elements any European Partner State may deem
that activity ... occurred within its territory.”

In view of the U.S. Space Bill, the IGA, the Registration Convention and the
provisions on registration in the Outer Space Treaty in appears that U.S. law is the law,
which is most often applicable. In situations where U.S. law is not applicable there are
no clear answers, and therefore considerable commercial risk to space missions from
both a policy and economic perspective may be present.

The mission planner should be aware of two patent cases. Hughes Aircraft
Company/Williams in 1973 obtained a patent relating to the spin stabilization of
satellites to assure obtaining and maintaining satellite attitude on orbit. Hughes Air-
craft Company sued the U.S. Government for infringement of its patent, because the
government used the concept without paying for it. It was not until 1983 that multi-
billion-dollar decision against the Government was handed down after the U.S. and
others had launched 108 satellites, which infringed the patent rights of Hughes Aircraft
Company. The lesson is clear; patent infringement may have very significant eco-
nomic consequences

The second concern stems from a patent granted to TRW/Horstein et al. in 1995.
Patent rights are based upon the “claims” in the patent application. The main claim of
this patent in essence is an “orbital shell” above the Earth from 5,600 to 10,000
nautical miles reserved for TRW exclusively, for all communications applications to
mobile handsets. Soon after the patent was granted TRW sued ICO Global Communi-
cations Ltd. to prevent them from launching satellites into the proscribed altitudes. The
case was dismissed because there was no present infringement.

Nevertheless, this is a troublesome patent, because it flies directly in the face of the
Outer Space Treaty provisions on nonappropriation of space by any nation including
its private entities. In my opinion the patent is fatally flawed if it is interpreted to give
any property rights to a spatial location. Were another nation to raise the issue in the
UN. or some other forum, the U.S., under its treaty obligations, would have no alter-
native but to “correct” the situation by legislation or cause a review of the original
patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A mission planner must, however,
face the risks of litigation, which entail not only lost time but also the economic
consequences.

21.1.2 U.S. Space Policy

A cohesive, consistent U.S. space policy does not exist. This conclusion follows
from the lack of success of the program to get us into space. It has not reached new
technological or cultural plateaus nor even maintained the initial pace.

What then must the mission planner consider from a U.S. policy prospective in
mission design? Policy direction can change so quickly that the shorter the design and
construction cycle, the better. Experience teaches us that government funding for
projects can evaporate overnight. This being the case, get your money up front if
possible, or at least attempt to obtain “fenced” funding.* For government projects you
will need a single powerful backer or several who can provide funding. Political and
economic support may be available from various sources. However, the advantage of

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 829

securing interest and support from a number of sources may be more than offset by the
necessity to serve various conflicting goals.

Policy edicts may be forthcoming from an administration, particularly the National
Space Council, vocal committees of the Congress, and of course, industry groups. Do
not be misled by the apparent credibility of the source or the clarity of the proposed
goal. Words are cheap. All too often promises are made but are not backed up with
budgeting and funding.

Even if you are doing a commercial project you will need an expert to advise you
on national space policy sensitivities. The problem is you do not need to find
friends—you only need to avoid enemies. The most likely enemies are potential com-
petitors. While they probably cannot block your project directly, they may have
friends in government who can. Accordingly, if it is possible, design the project in
such a way that it is cooperative with others and not in direct competition. You should
also be careful to assess what law and policy implications may arise from the proposed
mission. These concerns may be national and international.

An example of this intergovernmental coordination was the effort by Space Indus-
tries, Inc., to secure government funding for the ISF (Industrial Space Facility).
Hoping to get a fast start, they submitted the proposal to a congressional committee
without adequate coordination with NASA and other interested governmental agen-
cies. They were successful in getting support from the committee and the National
Space Council. They were even mentioned specifically in President Reagan’s 1988
space policy report. All of this withered and died because they had not made their
peace with the supporters of the Space Station who felt that money spent on the ISF
would be taken from Space Station funding and might ultimately result in the Space
Station project being reduced or cancelled. The net result was that the ISF became tied
up in red tape and did not get funding.

The bottom line is that space mission analysis and design must concern itself with
the vagaries of policy and the multitude of concerns and interests that exist in the
political arena.

Tighter constraints of federal budgets and an increasing demand for some form of
economic return on federal investments has led to insistence by Congress that the
federal government work with industry and buy from the private sector when possible.
The 1998 legislation requires NASA to identify opportunities for commercial pro-
viders to participate in the International Space Station and to study the possibility of
turning the space shuttle operation plus the space station over to commercial operators
after it is assembled in orbit. Additionally space science data must be purchased from
commercial providers to the extent possible.

21.1.3 Responsibility—Liability and Insurance

The Outer Space Treaty, Article VI, first established a nation’s responsibility for its
acts in space, as well as those of its citizens acting privately. This provision looks to
the future and requires a nation to authorize and continually supervise all of its space
activity to assure it conforms with treaties and international law. We must take into
account this risk of regulation when we design a project and plan how to accommodate
governmental supervision.

* Fenced funding is a term deriving from appropriations usage, meaning that monies allocated
for a certain purpose cannot be otherwise allocated, even within the same agency or
organization.

830 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

Liability, the other side of the responsibility coin, looks to the past. The Outer Space
Treaty, Article VII, first specified liability for space activity. Then came the 1972
Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. This
Convention was intended to protect the nonspace-faring nations, so it held space-
faring nations absolutely liable if they caused injury or damage on Earth. Absolute
liability simply means that someone who is injured may claim compensation just by
proving damage and who did it, without having to demonstrate negligence or fault. If
damage occurs in space, however, space-faring nations must prove fault to recover
damages.

The procedure for settling claims calls first for negotiations by the nations involved.
The only claimant under the Convention is another nation, bringing a claim on its own
behalf or on behalf of its citizens. If these negotiations fail, a three-member claims
commission is formed. Each nation involved appoints one member. The two appointed
members then appoint a third, the chairman.

The first case under this Convention involved the reentry of Cosmos 954 over the
Northwest Territory of Canada on January 24, 1978. Negotiations between Canada
and the USSR were successful. The nuclear reactor scattered radioactive debris over
124,000 km2. The search and recovery effort (Operation Morning Light) cost Canada
almost $14M Canadian dollars, but it settled for $3M. Canada elected not to claim the
cost of $8M for its officials and employees nor for equipment. The USSR argued that
Canada was too meticulous in the clean-up operations and that if this event had
occurred in Siberia, she would not have expended that much effort. Additionally, the
USSR asserted that she had offered to help clean up, but Canada rejected the offer. Had
she been permitted to help, the costs would have been much less. This amicable settle-
ment for 50% of the claim set a positive precedent for the future.

Under the Liability Convention, the U.S. must pay when her space activities injure
citizens of other nations or their property. U.S. citizens may recover for personal injury
or damage under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Thus, the government requires insur-
ance before authorizing a commercial launch. Government launches, both military and
civil, do not have formal insurance coverage, as the government is a self-insurer. If the
government suffers a loss, it allocates more funds from the public coffers.

For commercial launches and potentially those conducted for foreign governments,
we need to consider the following types of insurance:

¢ Pre-Launch. Pre-launch coverage insures against the risks from damage
during shipment of the launcher and the satellite, as well as during integration
and movement to the launch pad.

Government Equipment. The government now requires launches on commer-
cial expendable vehicles to provide insurance for loss to government launch
equipment and facilities. The Commercial Space Launch Act (amended 1988)
caps the amount at $100M. The Secretary of Transportation determines for
each launch vehicle if less is appropriate; examples are $75M for the Atlas and
$80M for either the Titan or Delta.

Third-Party Liability. Launch vehicle operators and satellite owners may
cause injury to others through the reentry. The risk is small because these
objects generally burn up in the atmosphere during reentry. If they do not, they
would typically strike the ocean or one of the uninhabited areas that make up
most of the Earth’s surface. Because of this low risk, coverage is less expen-

21.1

Law and Policy Considerations 831

sive though still required by DOT for launch vehicles and satellites and by
NASA for commercial satellites.

When NASA was the only means of access to space for commercial satellites,
their regulations established an insurance policy of $500M, with the gov-
ernment assuming the risk above that amount. This limit was a practical one
because the insurance community could not insure a greater amount. Now that
commercial launch vehicles will be the prime means of transportation into
space, Congress has established a similar cap of $500M, until the world’s
insurance community can provide greater coverage. The purpose of this
provision of the 1988 Amendment to the Commercial Launch Act was to
attempt to level the commercial playing field as Arianespace requires an
FF400M insurance policy. This amount was based upon the prior NASA pol-
icy of requiring $500M coverage.

Private operators of launch vehicles must also concern themselves with
liability claims from citizens of the U.S. and around the world. The DOT reg-
ulations require coverage against this risk before issuing a launch license.

Launch Failure. The most expensive insurance coverage insures the satellite
value from the moment of lift-off to on-orbit checkout. The prices for this
coverage have risen from 5%—10% of the satellite value to 25%—30% and then
settled back to 16%-20%. Shuttle launches enjoyed about a 5% discount.
Because it was a man-rated vehicle, the insurance community had a high con-
fidence in its reliability. In the early days, insurance companies charged very
low premiums for three reasons: they had few insurance losses; brokers knew
little about space vehicles and the risks involved; and they competed to get into
the business because space had pizazz.

Premiums rose dramatically with the loss of the Shuttle Challenger in 1986
and several failures of expendable launch vehicles shortly thereafter. In fact,
the space insurance community paid out 3 times more in loss claims than they
took in through premiums. Once the U.S. and Ariane programs were back on
track, premiums moderated. Still, as we plan commercial launches, we must
try to choose launch vehicles and satellites with a history of success. Other-
wise, insurance probably will be unavailable or prohibitively priced.

Reflight. A corollary risk which the launch-vehicle manufacturer may cover is
a guarantee to refly the mission or indemnification of the value of launch
service. Whether a company will provide either at no cost depends on the
launch vehicle’s past experience and the competitive climate. A contract nor-
mally covers this risk, but Iam sure the insurance community would cover it
for a price.

Loss to Others on the Flight. Under provisions of NASA launch contracts, the
risk of damage to a payload by another payload or by NASA’s actions falls
under a Hold Harmless Clause. This provision means that all parties to the
launch agree not to sue each other regardless of what happens. This practical
remedy came about because it is very difficult to calculate the risk and deter-
mine the premium. The risk also seemed low, and experience bears out this
assessment as no incidents have occurred. This solution is also true for com-
panion satellites launched commercially.

832 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

* On-Orbit Performance. A further risk concerns whether a satellite will con-
tinue to perform. Communications satellites especially need coverage when
the launch insurance terminates after on-orbit checkout. Satellite owners must
have this “life” insurance coverage if they do not have sufficient resources to
“self insure” the risks. Banks that finance communications systems usually
demand this insurance. An alternative may be enough satellites on orbit to
back-up the system.

In the past, buyers of space services (particularly communications service) con-
tracted to build a satellite, sought a launch aboard the Shuttle or on Ariane, and then
tried to secure one or more of the insurance coverages explained above. But compe-
tition in the satellite-construction and expendable-launch-vehicle industries has
changed this procedure. Instead, the buyer puts out a request for proposals calling for
on-orbit delivery with acceptance after checkout. This change shifts the burden and
risks. Only time will tell whether the cost to the buyer of a space service will be higher.
If competition is intense enough, which I predict it will be through the year 2010, the
cost may decrease. If so, this turnkey package arrangement will be the norm rather than
the exception.

One further note is appropriate. It might appear reasonable for one of the aerospace
giants—manufacturer of satellites or expendable launch vehicles—to step up and
provide insurance guarantees themselves. But the IRS has taken the position that a cor-
poration may not set aside funds from successful launches to act as a reserve, without
paying taxes on these funds. If companies could set aside untaxed reserves, they could
gain a considerable economic advantage by offering insurance potentially unavailable
from the insurance community, whose worldwide reserves are less than $20 billion.
As an alternative, launch companies could acquire a block of insurance commitments
for its launches from the insurance community and offer these to customers to sweeten
a deal.

In a perfect world, actuarial risk would reflect the cost of risk plus overhead
and profit. Cost of risk is simply the total value of all losses experienced divided
by the total number of events or launches. Unfortunately, despite manufacturers’
quoted success rates of 85%-98%, we do not have enough total launches to derive ac-
tuarially correct figures. Therefore, the price of insurance tends to depend on “feel”
and various intangibles. As pointed out above, failures drive prices up, and successes
decrease them. Interestingly, these variations occur whether or not a failure was
insured. Space insurers paid nothing for the 1986 Challenger disaster; yet they were so
shaken that insurance coverage was not available for a period of time. For up-to-
date insurance coverage provisions and costs, contact Alexander and Alexander,
Washington, DC; Coroon and Black, Bethesda, MD; or Marsh and McLennon, Wash-
ington, DC.

21.1.4 Remote Sensing

Anyone planning to launch a satellite that can sense the Earth needs to know the
Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Space, a resolution adopted
by the U.N. General Assembly on December 3, 1986. The USSR sought to prohibit
the sensing of a nation without its consent and the developing nations sought to
prohibit the release of information about a nation without its consent. Instead, this
resolution was a victory for the “open skies” policy of the U.S. and the space-faring
nations.

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 833

The key points are:

¢ Itis a resolution, not a treaty, but as the world continues to follow its precepts
it will become international law through custom.

* The resolution applies only to sensing “for the purpose of improving natural
resource management, land use and the protection of the environment.” It does
not apply to applications related to national security.

* Data is divided into classes: primary or raw data, processed data, and analyzed
information. Primary data is the same as unenhanced data under the Land
Remote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984, so it must be released to all
customers at reasonable cost. Processed data and analyzed information is data
resulting from “value added activity” over which a company can assert
property rights and refuse its release.

¢ The resolution states that nations will conduct remote-sensing activities with
respect for other nations’ sovereignty, not damaging the legitimate rights and
interests of the sensed nation.

Legal arguments may affect how a reconnaissance or imaging satellite operates.
Originally, in a classified memorandum, President Carter prohibited a U.S. company
from disclosing remote-sensing information with a resolution better than 10 m. Pres-
ident Reagan’s space policy rescinded this prohibition in February 1988, because the
USSR was selling photographic images with 5 m resolution. France, Russia, Canada,
China, Japan, and India provide commercially available remote sensing imagery;
therefore if a nation or corporation wants to keep something secret, it had best hide it.
The press will be the least of its worries. In my view, only cost will limit these
activities.

Since 1982 the U.S. government policy towards remote sensing technologies has
evolved from a very restrictive view of remote sensing as an intelligence gathering
methodology which was classified to a broader view which promotes privatization,
declassification and commercial exploitation. Efforts to expand this industry included
requiring NASA to acquire remote sensing data from commercial providers. However,
the industry has not developed as quickly as it might have because of lengthy coordi-
nation required by various federal agencies before a license to launch and operate a
satellite system is issued. Unless the Department of State yields to the Department of
Commerce and permits a reasonably unfettered development of a U.S. industry the
market will be served by foreign competitors. In order to encourage the emergence of
a competitive U.S. commercial remote sensing industry it will be necessary for the
government to support investments in new remote sensing technologies, remove
unnecessary restrictions on the dissemination of privately gathered data, and stream-
line the licensing process.

21.1.5 Import and Export Restrictions

We need not consider restrictions on imports into the U.S. unless a project has
federal funding. In that event, the Buy America Act and domestic preference provi-
sions in various other acts and regulations could affect purchases. In the past, an
exploding number of statutes and regulations direct federal agencies to give domestic
sources absolute or qualified preferences when they procure goods and services. These
provisions, with exceptions and qualifications, appear in trade legislation, appropria-

834 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

tion statutes, procurement laws and regulations, Executive Orders, treaties, and
Memoranda of Understanding with foreign governments.

In general, the Buy America Act prohibits buying foreign goods rather than
services, but NASA has held that a supplier of space services may not use foreign
goods to provide the service. Under this Act, a product is not foreign if more than 50%
comes from domestic sources, and the DoD may buy from NATO countries. The Act’s
provisions and rules will give American mission planners headaches and keep many
contracting officers and lawyers fully employed.

Three mechanisms control exports from the U.S. First, commodities and technical
data on the commodities control list fall under the licensing requirement of the Export
Administration Act of 1979. The Commerce Department’s Office of Export Admin-
istration runs this program and has published a series of detailed regulations. An
example of this process in the space sector was the approval for Payload Systems, Inc.
to fly a crystal-growth experiment aboard the MIR space station.

The second control applies when a patent involves military technology. The
Departments of Defense and Energy review the export application, and either depart-
ment may classify the information to keep it secret, thus preventing export.

The third restriction stems from the Arms Export Control Act. The Office of
Munitions Control under the Department of State determines along with other Federal
agencies what items fall under the Act’s licensing provisions. This office has consid-
erable discretion in determining whether a license should be issued. As a result, the
United States Munitions List once included satellites and computer programs and
many other items not traditionally thought of as weapons.

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations implement the Arms Export Control
Act. The Munitions List specifically includes rockets, spacecraft, space electronics,
and guidance equipment. Defense services are also included, defined as furnishing
help to foreigners “in the design, engineering, development, production, processing,
manufacturing, use, operations, overhaul, repair, maintenance, modification or recon-
struction of articles.” Included is the furnishing to foreigners any technical data
whether in the U.S. or abroad. Finally, no one may provide foreigners technical data,
meaning information classified or even related to defense articles.

Under these regulations, an export does not have to cross a border. For example, an
export occurs when an individual discloses technical data concerning a spacecraft or
rocket, even if the disclosure is part of a potential sale and within the U.S. These rules
do not apply to NATO members, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, but they still pose
significant hurdles if we are seeking a world market. An example of this was the
application to the Department of State by United Technologies Corporation to assist
the Cape York Space Agency in developing a launch complex in Australia for the
Soviet Zenit Launch Vehicle.

21.1.6 Environmental Concerns

The National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations call for
review of the Federal Government’s actions to determine their effect on the environ-
ment. Major actions involve substantial time, money, and resources. They affect large
areas or act strongly on small areas. Recommendations on these actions must consider
their effects with special care.

When an action occurs in the U.S., we must take into account social, economic, and
other environments. When it occurs outside the U.S., the requirements narrow.
Whether environmental protection extends to activities in outer space depends on how

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 835

we interpret the concept of global commons. In international law, “global commons”
includes those territories outside the jurisdiction of any nation, such as the high seas,
the upper atmosphere, the oceans, Antarctica, and particularly, outer space. Official
U.S. documents which discuss “global commons” have not specifically mentioned
outer space.

Whether the National Environmental Policy Act applies to outer space is not
entirely clear, but the U.S. still has obligations under Article IX of the Outer Space
Treaty which provides for international protection of the outer-space environment.
Thus, we must comply with either the letter of the Act’s provisions or their essence. If
a proposed mission “has been done before,” environmental questions may quickly be
resolved. But if it includes something new, we may wait some time for approval,
depending on how strongly the mission affects outer space or, especially, any celestial
body.

For a government mission, the responsible agency must analyze the environmental
effects. If more than one agency is involved, a lead agency supervises the preparation
of the environmental documentation. For a private or commercial launch, the DOT
would require an environmental impact assessment under its mandate from the
Commercial Launch Act.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, we must complete either an en-
vironmental assessment or an environmental impact statement. An assessment helps
determine whether we need an impact statement for a particular action. It must include
enough information to determine whether the proposed action is major and whether it
significantly harms the environment of the “global commons.” We must assess the
environmental effects and the need for the proposed action plus available alternatives.
Unless security restrictions intervene, the assessment is available to the public upon
request. There is no need to obtain public comment. An assessment is less formal and
rigorous than an impact statement. Typically, it applies to:

* Spacecraft development projects in space science and in space and terrestrial
applications

* Specific experimental projects in space and energy technology
¢ Development and operations of new space transportation systems

* Advanced development of new space transportation and spacecraft systems

In contrast, we would need to file an impact statement when an action is “expected
to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.” Our draft state-
ment should be thorough enough to permit analysis and comment. If it is complete
enough after agency review, it goes to the public for comment. At this time, the
Department of State, the Council on Environmental Quality, and other federal
agencies also have the chance to comment. For the proposed action and reasonable
alternatives, the environmental impact statement: (1) considers purpose and need;
(2) provides a detailed description; (3) analyzes the environmental effects; (4) briefly
describes the affected environment of the “global commons”; and (5) compares the
alternatives’ effects on the “global commons.”

If we do not know something because it is unavailable or scientifically uncertain,
we must say so in the impact statement. Public hearings are not required, but may be
appropriate, depending on circumstances. After agencies and the public have com-
mented, we redo the statement, further analyzing any issues they have raised. Then we

836 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

publish it in the Federal Register before forwarding it to the decision maker for final
action.

Normally, we would need an impact statement for R&D activities associated with
developing and operating new launch vehicles, space vehicles likely to release large
amounts of foreign materials into the Earth’s atmosphere or into space, and certain
systems for nuclear propulsion and generating power. Some listed exclusions do not
require a statement, but we probably will have to do an assessment if any “significant
environmental effects” are possible. Unless the project has been done before, we can
expect a bureaucrat to require an assessment of environmental effects, so he or she can
determine if an assessment is required! The first assessment should determine what is
required: (1) no environmental assessment; (2) only an environmental assessment; or
(3) an environmental impact statement. Although it is difficult to predict exactly how
long this process will take, we should anticipate 3 to 6 months for a simple assessment,
one to 2 years for a simple impact statement, and up to 5 years for international con-
cerns or a suit in federal court.

In some cases, the action may affect the environment of a foreign nation or a
resource designated as one of global importance. If so, we would use slightly different
procedures. First, we would prepare an environmental survey or review. An environ-
mental survey is a cooperative action and may be bilateral or multilateral. Whether or
not we do a review depends on consultations which determine if the proposed action
would do significant harm. The content is flexible, but generally includes (1) a review
of the affected environment, (2) the predicted environmental effects, and (3) signif-
icant known actions that governmental entities are taking to protect or improve the
environment against the proposed action. If the government is not acting, is this inac-
tivity an oversight or a conscious decision?

The U.S. prepares an environmental review unilaterally. In effect, it is an internal
action, by which one or more governmental agencies surveys the important environ-
mental issues associated with the proposed action. It contains essentially the same
information as an environmental survey.

Lasers and Particle Beams

Lasers and particle beams illuminating into space have caused almost no problems.
The reason is fairly straightforward: in the U.S., such experiments are carried out by
government laboratories or under government control. They have agreements with
NORAD/USSPACECOM to search the space catalog and provide windows of oppor-
tunity, so illuminating does not interfere with operational spacecraft.

Nuclear Power Sources

Nuclear power sources have raised questions since they were first used. The U.S.
program began using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator with SNAP-3A in the
summer of 1961 and continued to 1977. In April 1965, SNAP 10 was the only U.S.
space nuclear reactor. The U.S. safety program includes an Interagency Nuclear Safety
Review Panel composed of three coordinators appointed by the Secretary of Defense,
the Administrator of NASA, and the Secretary of Energy. The Nuclear Regulatory
Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration also participate in these reviews. The safety review ascertains
whether the benefits of using nuclear power are worth the risks. The policy of the U.S.
in using radioisotope thermoelectric generators following an aborted SNAP-A mission
in April 1964 was to design the container so that all nuclear material would survive
intact, regardless of the nature of the accident. The policy makers specifically envi-

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 837

sioned reentry and impact on earth. On May 18, 1968, the range safety officer aborted
the launch of NIMBUS-81 at an altitude of 30 km over the Santa Barbara Channel. The
generator capsules were recovered without incident. Those who launched SNAP 10A
with a nuclear reactor in 1965 launched the reactor in a subcritical mode, designed it
to remain subcritical at or after impact should it reenter the atmosphere before start-
up, and delayed its start-up until it had reached orbit. It is in an almost circular polar
orbit, which has a decay life of 4,000 years. Additionally, this reactor package was
designed to come apart on reentry.

Design for safety must include both system and mission design. The methods to
reduce risks from nuclear materials include containing them within radioisotope
thermoelectric generators, diluting and dispersing them with reactors, delaying their
effects by boosting them into a higher orbit, and possibly retrieving them using a
vehicle like the Shuttle.

On the international front, the untimely reentry of Cosmos 954 in 1978 (see
Sec 21.1.3) caused great concern around the world and has been the subject of dis-
cussion in the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A working
group’s February 1981 report on Cosmos 954 reaffirmed that nuclear power is safe in
outer space if it meets safety requirements. Some people still suggest a ban on nuclear
power, and Australia has specified solar rather than nuclear power in a request for
proposals for surveillance satellites.

Only the former USSR routinely used nuclear power to run its Radar Ocean
Reconnaissance Satellites (RORSATSs). In the future, other nations will consider this
power source to serve particular needs. For example, the U.S. had under discussion
powerful reactors to provide power to space components of the Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI). The SP100s would generate 100 kW, some 25 times more powerful
than the RORSATs. These developments pose two risks: return to Earth with much
more fissionable material than on RORSATs and increases in radiation from gamma
rays and positrons. The positrons from the reactor temporarily form an artificial
radiation belt in the Earth’s magnetic field. When they strike another spacecraft, the
positrons produce penetrative gamma-rays. This radiation interferes with astrono-
mers’ readings of natural radiation from such phenomena as solar flares, neutron stars,
and black holes.

In the late 1980s, such radiation from Soviet spacecraft occasionally overloaded the
gamma-ray spectrometer on board the U.S. Solar Maximum Mission satellite. The
Japanese X-ray satellite, GINGA, also suffered, and the U.S. Gamma-Ray Observa-
tory may be affected.

Thus, as the need for nuclear power increases, we can expect greater pressure,
particularly from the scientific and astronomical communities, to stop its use. Consid-
ering its unique abilities, I predict that nuclear power will not be banned from space,
but its use will be closely regulated. Unless we must use a nuclear power source to
complete a mission, we should select another form of power.

Space Debris

Space debris is the other significant environmental issue. It affects mission
designers in two ways. First, we must plan the mission to prevent or abate space debris
as much as possible. Second, we must design satellites to meet the risk of collision
with debris. Aside from a few cries in the wilderness, space debris received little
official notice until the late 1980s. Johnson and McKnight [1991] provide an extended
technical discussion of this problem, and Reijnen and de Graff [1990] provide a
discussion from a legal perspective.

838 Limits on Mission Design 21.1

In 1986, the U.S. Air Force Science Advisory board questioned its 1983 position
that debris did not appear to be a problem. As a result, the DoD established in March
1987 a space debris policy. It states in part that the “design and operation of DoD space
tests, experiments, and systems will strive to minimize or reduce accumulation of
space debris consistent with mission requirements.”

In a final statement on space policy, released in February 1988, President Reagan
called for a review of the U.S. policy on space debris. As a result, a Report on Orbital
Debris by the Interagency Group (Space) was released in February 1989. It reflected
the Group’s uncertainty as to the urgency for action. Its major recommendation was a
joint study by NASA and DoD that would develop a comprehensive plan to improve
the monitoring of debris, so debris predictions could be more accurate. The report
identifies two critical areas in space for the near term. Low-Earth orbit requires atten-
tion because of the large masses of material and the high relative velocities. At the
same time, the geosynchronous arc requires attention because of the number of space-
craft which will lose their maneuvering ability within the next few years. The report
then echoes the DoD policy on managing debris.

This report stands in contrast with the report of the ESA’s Space Debris Working
Group, dated November, 1988. The Director General observed that clearly the present
debris in the space environment poses little threat to either manned or unmanned
missions. However, “‘we must adopt a conscious policy aimed at curbing the growth
of debris.” The report lists the same two areas of concern— low-Earth and geosyn-
chronous orbits—and notes another concern for astronomical observers. It concludes
by requiring preventive measures: observing and analyzing present debris, avoiding
collisions, and minimizing collision effects and future space debris. It asks nations to
reduce the number of pieces and the mass of space debris.

Strikingly, the ESA’s report is a call to action. The agency is urged to start taking
steps—organizational, technical, and institutionat—to seek cooperation with others and
thereby counter the threat to space flight. Why then does the U.S. simply want to study
the matter further? The answer is both political and economic. Politically, the U.S. has
had difficulty discussing technical issues with developing nations in the U.N. Time and
again the U.S. has been outvoted on philosophical grounds and is not ready to hear
political dialogues in the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The U.S.,
therefore, looks to multilateral discussions with space-faring nations to solve problems.

The economic issue is equally sensitive. The U.S. is a space-faring nation which
plays a major role in launching its own satellites and those of its western partners into
space. Thus, it is loath to set a policy “prematurely” which could cost a lot of money
to solve the space debris problem. The key words in the U.S. report are “where feasible
and cost-effective.” The U.S. recognizes that the problem demands multinational
solutions but wants to avoid expensive “political solutions.”

Advice: stay out of the politics if at all possible. Choose a launch vehicle that is at
least no worse than average in terms of causing debris and plan the mission with space
debris abatement features. If you minimize debris, you will get much faster approval
for your space mission.

21.1.7 FireSat Legal and Policy Issues

At first blush it would seem that there could be no issues at all. However, the first
question is whether FireSat is going to be a U.S. Government project or a project with
private financing.

21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 839

If this is a government project the mission planner needs to evaluate whether the
Department of Agriculture or U.S. Forest Service is going to support funding or at-
tempt to sabotage the project. Will they see it as a boon to their fire fighting mission
or a threat, because there will be less need for fire fighting equipment and personnel,
which will jeopardize Congressional funding? What agency will be responsible for the
project after it is launched? Will their staffing and funding be increased to cover addi-
tional responsibilities? What international agreements cover firefighting support? Will
foreign nations have a right to the information from FireSat? Does the U.S. face any
liability from the release of the information on fires? In other words, would there be
liability if FireSat did not report a fire? Under the U.N. Principles on Remote Sensing
the U.S. is obligated to provide data to all nations at cost. Will the data supplied be raw
data or enhanced data? Who will supply the equipment to analyze the data? Will the
FireSat mission as planned support all requests for information? What infrastructure
will be necessary to support the U.S.’s treaty obligations? Who will pay for it?

From a mission perspective how many satellites will be necessary? What is the
replacement strategy? Who are the launch providers going to be? Can these satellites
be launched with other satellites (size and position questions) or do they require dedi-
cated launches? Are there any satellites using these altitudes? What is the space debris
situation? Are any special shields required to protect the satellite? Do the FireSat sen-
sors pose any threat of interference to other satellites? Are the mission and function of
the FireSat satellites in total conformity with U.S. international policy? Might not
Brazil, for example, object to the monitoring of their forests, fearing that the U.S. was
trying to make a case to hold them responsible for their failure to control burning in
the forests?

These are examples of the kinds of questions that need to be answered. Inevitably
the answers cause more questions. From the limited information we have about the
FireSat Mission, I believe that from a legal and policy perspective the mission is
doable. J am aware of the saying, “If you cannot stand the answer do not ask the
question.” However, it is a foolish mission planner that refuses to at least know of the
risks,

21.1.8 Asteroids

There has been recent interest in asteroids (Space Development Corporation) as a
potential mining opportunity. Private businessmen have proposed launching missions
to asteroids to bring back rare and precious metals. There is also interest in the Moon
and it is said to contain aluminum, calcium, iron, silicon, and small amounts of chro-
mium, magnesium, manganese and titanium. It also has oxygen and sulfur. Some have
proposed to do this regardless of the legal and policy issues. The question of ownership
of asteroids and the right to sever valuable ore is not totally clear.

The Moon Treaty of 1979 addresses the subject of mining the Moon, asteroids and
other celestial bodies. In general it provides for the establishment of an International
Regime to authorize and control any mining activity at such time as the exploitation
of natural resources becomes feasible. A critical element of the Moon Treaty is the
principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind. Under this principle there is the com-
mitment that all nations must share in the management and benefits from such activity.
It is this provision for sharing of benefits without contribution of investment that has
caused the U.S. and other space-faring nations to refrain from joining the treaty. Only
Australia, Austria, Chile, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Pakistan, The Philip-
pines and Uruguay have ratified the agreement.

840 Limits on Mission Design 21.2

The argument could be made that as long as the U.S. is not a party to the treaty U.S.
corporations should be permitted to conduct mining operations on the theory that what
is not prohibited is permitted. Standing alone this logic is sound, but it overlooks the
give and take in the international community on a vast number of issues. Many of the
developing nations firmly believe that they are entitled to share in the profits from
space activity and would deeply resent actions by U.S. or others from developed
countries “stealing” from them. Accordingly it is a virtual certainty that the U.S.
government would not issue a license to conduct mining activity on the Moon or other
celestial bodies.

The United Societies in Space has proposed a Lunar Economic Development
Authority and some modifications to the Moon Treaty so that mining operations could
be explored. Creating legal certainty will be the first step in financing such a project.

There was a similar situation with the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty which was
resolved in 1994 by a U.N. General Assembly resolution. The provisions were modi-
fied to give the U.S. and other key nations a major say in the undersea mining and that
has facilitated exploration and the beginning of operations. This appears to be the most
viable solution to asteroid mining, but a first priority will be reducing transportation
costs.

21.2 Orbital Debris—A Space Hazard

Ronald A. Madler, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
Darren S. McKnight, Titan Research and Technology

About 20,000 tons of natural material consisting of interplanetary dust, meteoroids
and asteroid/comet fragments filter down to the Earth’s surface every year, with
several hundred kilograms in LEO at any one time (Kessler, 1985; Zook et al., 1970].
This natural hazard has been recognized as a danger to space travel since the 1940s,
but now human activities in space have created a hazard of even greater concern.
Figure 21-1 portrays both the natural environment and the artificially created debris
population [Adapted from NASA and NRC sources]. Millions of kilograms of artifi-
cial debris orbit the Earth and present a serious concern to continued safe access to
space. The growth of orbital debris poses a series of difficulties for space mission
designers. To control the growth of debris and its associated hazards, we should take
a number of steps during the design process. As seen in Fig. 21-2, the debris mitigation
process spans all phases of the mission profile. Similarly, NASA debris mitigation
guidelines cover all aspects of the mission design process. These guidelines can be
found in NASA Safety Standard 1740.14 [1995], while software to parallel the safety
standard is also available from NASA.

21.2.1 Environmental Definition

Meteoroids have been a concern since the beginning of human spaceflight.
Engineers performed a tremendous amount of work to understand the hazard posed to
spacecraft by meteoroids. While meteoroid-effect studies and model improvements
continue, researchers have understood the meteoroid background flux fairly well since
the late 1960s. One meteoroid flux model is represented in Fig. 21-1. There has been
a resurgence of interest in meteoroids due to the possible storm conditions associated
with the Leonid meteor stream in 1998-1999 [Yeomans, 1998]. While most meteor-

oids have relative velocities of about 19-20 km/s with respect to the Earth, the Leonids
have a relative velocity of approximately 70 km/s.* This higher velocity will produce
more damage on impact, which could be of concern to spacecraft owners and
operators. There were no significant anomalies associated with the 1998 Leonids.

We define debris as any nonoperational manmade object in space. These objects
include nonfunctioning payloads, used rocket bodies, mission-related debris (e.g., lens
covers or separation devices), debris from surface degradation (e.g., insulation or paint
chips), and debris from on-orbit fragmentation. This derelict hardware accounts for
93% of the cataloged objects in orbit; only 7% are active payloads. Table 21-1 shows
the breakdown of cataloged objects [Johnson et al., 2002]. Table 21-2 shows causes
for these on-orbit fragmentation events. Debris from the more than 175 fragmentation
events are by far the largest source of orbital debris.

The U.S. Space Command compiles the trackable debris tracked by its worldwide
Space Surveillance Network (SSN) in a satellite catalog. This worldwide network of
radar and optical facilities senses, tracks, identifies, and catalogs data on over 8,500
large orbiting objects. It senses objects with diameters as small as 10 cm in LEO and
1 min GEO. This detection limit is due to the original design of the system for tracking
large objects—debris detection was never envisioned as a task for the network. We
know that there exists a much larger population of smaller objects. This has been con-
firmed by recent campaigns with more sensitive radars. Figure 21-1 shows that there
are approximately an order of magnitude more objects in the 1 cm size than exists in
the catalog. The 1 cm size is significant because it is the largest size fragment that we
can effectively shield against. Thus, there are a significant number of objects that we
cannot track, but which can cause substantial spacecraft damage.

We can quantify how crowded space has become by using the spatial density, 1.e.,
the number of objects per volume of space. Figure 21-3 plots spatial density values out

* Editor’s Note: The Leonids are remnants of Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. They are in a retro-
grade orbit and collide with the Earth nearly head-on such that their velocity adds to the
Earth’s orbital velocity of about 30 km/s.

to 2,000 km altitude for cataloged objects of various sizes. The GEO curve represents
the spatial density within 1 deg of the equatorial plane. The average density between
800 and 1,000 km is just above 10-8 km-3. The smallest trackable objects may weigh
tens to hundreds of grams. We cannot shield against objects of this size. In GEO the
average spatial density is one to two orders of magnitude less than LEO. The average
relative velocity in LEO between orbiting objects is 9 to 10 km/s with maximum
values above 14 km/s due to eccentric and retrograde orbits. In comparison, the rela-
tive velocity between debris and satellites in GEO ranges between 100 and 500 m/s.
The difference in relative velocities is due mainly to the lower orbital velocities and
smaller inclination distribution of objects in GEO. This physical phenomenon couples
with the lower spatial density values in GEO to make the collision hazard much
smaller in GEO than LEO.

Fig. 21-3. Spatial Density Values. Densities in GEO are approximately 10 times less than in
LEO. The probability of a spacecraft getting hit by something big is small, while the
chance of getting hit by something small is big. See text for discussion.

In addition to the spatial density being different in LEO vs. GEO, the natural
cleansing effects also differ. In GEO and geosynchronous transfer orbit the major per-
turbations are solar/lunar gravitational effects. For very small debris, solar radiation
pressure may also significantly affect lifetimes, however, atmospheric drag at GEO
has no measurable influence. Hence, a major breakup in geosynchronous orbit will af-
fect all future operations in that regime. On the other hand, atmospheric drag greatly
affects the lifetimes of objects in LEO. The smaller debris fragments have significant-
ly larger area to mass ratios and thus drag affects them more. This natural removal of

844 Limits on Mission Design 21.2

orbital debris is very important in the long-term definition of the environment. We
have sensed decreases in the cataloged population only during periods of maximum
solar activity (1979-80 and 1988-90). However, in the 2000-2001 period of high solar
activity the overall cataloged population stayed fairly constant due to several signifi-
cant breakup events.

The other major variables in debris growth are the number and types of satellite
fragmentation events. As the debris population grows, the environment may become
so severe that satellite or object fragmentations due to hypervelocity collisions with
debris may occur [Kessler and Cour-Palais, 1978]. This type of event will mark a clear
trend toward a worsening environment. The first confirmed collision between cata-
loged objects occurred in July 1996. The altitude of a breakup will foretell the effect
on the long-term debris environment. Breakups below 500 km may have a major
influence for less than a decade while fragmentations above 500 km may pose large
hazards for many decades. Presently, there is no cost-effective method of removing
debris already in orbit. The prudent design of future spacecraft will lessen the chance
of debris generation and satellite fragmentation.

It is difficult to describe precisely the present status of the dynamic near-Earth
debris environment, much less to accurately predict the future debris environment, due
to uncertainties in traffic models and fragmentation rates. The trackable population
grew at a nearly linear rate from 1960 to 1990. We don’t know exactly how the
undetectable population grew, but it is more strongly influenced by the fragmentation-
event rate, satellite operational patterns, and the solar cycle [Johnson and McKnight,
1991]. Predictions of the actual number and flux of all debris rely on accurate model-
ing of its sources and sinks. We compare debris models with our best measurements
of the environment: impact rates on returned spacecraft surfaces for very small debris
and special radar measurements for detectable objects. We continually improve and
update these models as our understanding of the debris environment grows. Spacecraft
designers can look for the latest environmental models through one of the NASA,
DoD, ESA, or other international space agency Space Debris program offices.

21.2.2 Design Considerations: Spacecraft Hazard and Survivability Analysis

Mission designers must address two main issues concerning space debris. First, we
need to design debris protection for large, long-lived spacecraft to ensure mission suc-
cess. Second, we must use debris mitigation methods to ensure that space activities
will not continue to litter our near-Earth environment with more derelict hardware
[NSS 1740.14, 1995].

We can approximate the probability, P., of a piece of debris impacting a space
system using the kinetic theory of gases:

Po = | —e@ SPD ACT “VREL) (21-1)

where SPD is the spatial density of debris objects (i.e., average number of objects per
volume in space), AC is the collision cross-sectional area, T is the mission duration,
and VREL is the relative velocity between the satellite and debris population. Using
this simple equation, the rough order of magnitude approximation for collision
probability for one year in orbit for a range of altitudes and satellite sizes is listed in
Table 21-3. These values are approximate and only show the order of magnitude for
the probability of collision. Detailed analysis should use a more accurate debris envi-
ronment model [for example, Klinkrad et al., 1997 or Liou et al., 2002], as well as a

21.2 Orbital Debris—A Space Hazard 845

more refined representation of the spacecraft’s cross-sectional area. Also space
satellite designers must take the meteoroid environment into account. Meteoroids
dominate the hazard for sub-millimeter up to millimeter size, and can penetrate thin
honeycomb structures.

TABLE 21-3. Collision Probability per Year (in 1999). The table vaiues are approximated over
all inclinations for a cross-sectional area range of 5 to 40 m2. The cross-sectional
area is defined as the area viewed from one orientation, and is approximately 1/4
of the total surface area for simple convex shapes.

The cataloged population presents a manageable debris hazard to even large
spacecraft. However, incorporation of nontrackable objects into the hazard assessment
produces much larger probabilities of collision. The flux rate increases several orders
of magnitude for untrackable debris that can still cause damage. An encounter with a
1 cm fragment will likely produce significant amounts of debris, much of it trackable,
while a 1 mm impact most likely will cause surface degradation, localized craters and
small penetrations.

For GEO satellites, we may use alternate forms of probability of collision equations
which are more convenient due to the physically and dynamically different environ-
ment (Johnson and McKnight, 1991]. The objects have lower orbital velocities and
most reside in a narrow latitudinal band resulting in a distinct contrast to the more
randomly distributed LEO environment. The hazard in GEO appears to be about a
decade behind LEO, but the GEO population will grow quickly because there are
fewer natural sinks.

While we can determine the expected rate of impact for certain sized meteoroids
and debris relatively easily with one of the available orbital debris environment
models, determining the hazard to a spacecraft is not as straightforward. Christiansen
et al. [1992] outline this process as:

1. Determine failure or damage conditions for the mission
2. Determine impact conditions causing failure or damage

3. Determine likelihood of failure (integrating the step 2 equations over the flux,
direction, velocity, and projectile characteristics from debris environment
models)

846 Limits on Mission Design 21.2

4. Assess sufficiency of the design

5. Modify the design or requirements, if needed

Due to the dynamic nature of the debris environment, the best strategy is to inte-
grate debris awareness into all phases of the design process. However, it will be
increasingly expensive to actually implement any system changes the later in the
design process. Special attention to the protection of mission critical systems may still
be considered late in the design process.

The first step mentioned above entails determining what constitutes a failure or
unacceptable mission degradation. This is something each spacecraft may define dif-
ferently and will influence the hazard assessment. For the International Space Station,
loss of a module or loss of life may be the unacceptable damage level, while for an
unmanned spacecraft it may be loss of any critical system, such as attitude control.

The second step depends on the many unknowns of the projectile and the spacecraft
structures. In order to proceed with the hazard analysis, we must derive some kind of
equation relating damage to projectile characteristics. For pressure vessels, where
penetration will have serious implications, a ballistic limit equation is determined
which relates the projectile characteristics to the penetration ability for a specific
spacecraft wall. Researchers have determined equations for single walled spacecraft
and multilayered shielding configurations [Hayashida and Robinson, 1991; Chris-
tiansen et al., 1995; Christiansen, 1993]. Armed with the performance equations for
the spacecraft surfaces, we can determine a probability of failure by integrating over
all the expected projectiles from the debris models (step 3 above). The next step is to
determine if the probability of success is sufficient for the mission. If the probability
of success is not sufficient, then we need further protective measures or design modi-
fications. The RADARSAT mission is an example of a spacecraft that did not have an
acceptable level of risk after the preliminary design. Approximately 17 kg of shielding
was added to reach a comfortable level [Warren and Yelle, 1994].

Debris Protection

We often describe the expected damage of a debris impact, to first order, by the
relative kinetic energy of the impacting object. For a relative impact velocity of 10
km/s, a 100 g fragment (6—10 cm diameter) possesses the kinetic energy equivalent to
1 kg of TNT. On the smaller end of the scale, a 1.6 mm debris object has the same
kinetic energy as a 9 mm pistol slug. The amount of energy absorbed by the structure
and the level of damage is highly dependent on the impactor characteristics, satellite
structure and location of impact. Thus, it is difficult to determine the effect of a hyper-
velocity debris impact on a satellite without a considerable amount of specific satellite
and collision information. Nevertheless, a 100 g object impacting at 10 km/s will
produce extensive damage on any satellite, and would destroy any small, compact
satellite, given a center of mass collision.

Spacecraft will encounter micrometeoroids and orbital debris during their func-
tional lifetime. However, there are passive and active means to protect them from most
debris. Passive means include shielding and redundancy, while active generally refers
to collision avoidance. Bumper shields are effective for passive protection against
fragments smaller than 1 cm in diameter (mg range).

Figure 21-4 qualitatively shows how effective shielding systems are at defeating
an impacting particle. The bottom curve is for a single sheet wall, while the other

21.2 Orbital Debris—A Space Hazard 847

curves are for different shielding configurations which have the same weight as the
single wall. Shielding systems have one or more outer bumpers and sometimes in-
termediate backup layers before the innermost wall. Bumper shielding systems work
by fragmenting or vaporizing the projectile with the first layer when the projectile has
a very high velocity. The resulting debris cloud expands and hits the next layers over
a larger area, dispersing the energy of the projectile and the impulsive load. In the case
of a pressure vessel, this shielding increases the probability that the pressure hull will
survive impacts—without penetration, rupture or spall with a much thinner pressure
wall. In other words, when we optimize bumper shields, the resulting two or more
walls weigh less and provide better protection from particulate impact than a single
wall design. The bumper system has three main design parameters:

1. Thickness and material of the outer wall (shield or bumper)
2. Spacing between the shield and the backup layers

3. Thickness and material of the backup layers

Fig. 21-4. Ballistic Limit Curves for Several Satellite Wall Configurations. This figure
qualitatively shows the penetrating diameter of an impacting projectile vs. the impact
velocity for a single wall and two shielding options. The three sections of the shielding
curves correspond to projectile deformation, projectile fragmentation, and projectile
melt or vaporization, respectively, as the impact velocity increases. This assumes
spherical aluminum projectiles.

The design of the shield depends on the shield-to-projectile mass density ratio and
the projectile’s impact velocity. The debris environment parameters will vary by
altitude and change over time as events alter the environment. For a given environment
and spacecraft configuration (exposed area, structure and mission duration), we opti-
mize the shield thickness, ¢,, and wall spacing, S, to insure projectile fragmentation.

848 Limits on Mission Design 21.2

This highlights the main function of the shield: to break apart the impacting object so
that its debris will hit the backup layer(s) over a larger area, causing less damage.

The ability of the shield to lessen the effect of the projectile’s impact is directly
proportional to the shield’s ability to break it apart. The optimum situation occurs when
the shield and projectile fragments vaporize or liquefy. In this state they present less
hazard to the backup layer(s). Testing by NASA has shown that the ratio ¢,/d, where d
is the impacting particle’s length, is around 0.1 to 0.2 for a functional shield [Cour-
Palais, 1979]. This range is good for aluminum-on-aluminum impacts in the velocity
range 5-12 km/s. We obtain more beneficial effects if the shield has a low melt-
ing point and high mass density, both of which will produce more damage to the
projectile and a lower probability of solid particles striking the backup sheet [Cour-
Palais, 1979].

The equation for determining the “optimum” backup sheet thickness, t,, assumes
that shield and projectile debris are mostly in molten or vaporized states. For a basic
form of aluminum (7075-16), the equation for the condition where the backup sheet
will not deflect, rupture, or spall is given by Cour-Palais [1979]:

= Cmyv
b 52

where ¢, is the backup sheet thickness in cm, m is the projectile mass in g, v is the
projectile velocity in km/s, S is the spacing in cm, and an empirically derived constant
C= 41.5 +14.0 (cm3g—!km=!5).

The optimum design of a shield depends on the physical properties of the projectile
and its velocity. A design which works at one speed may not be as effective at other
speeds due to the characteristics of hypervelocity impacts. Also, the composite and
sandwich construction methods common on many commercial spacecraft have differ-
ent properties than simple aluminum structures [Taylor et al., 1998]. System designers
should look for the latest references because the science and art of shielding progresses
rapidly.

Structures such as the International Space Station must have extensive shielding to
survive the particle environment. Multilayered shielding will greatly reduce the prob-
ability of a penetration to the pressure hulls of the Station. Other spacecraft also have
vulnerable systems and components that must be protected to ensure a successful
mission. Mission critical systems and components must either have special shielding
from debris, or be shielded by less critical structures. An understanding of the debris
hazard can help spacecraft designers to minimize the cost of the spacecraft by design-
ing survival into the vehicle from the beginning. Table 21-4 lists some common sense
design guidelines.

(21-2)

Debris Avoidance

Some satellites may face a significant hazard due to trackable objects. In this case,
designers and operators may need to use passive and active avoidance techniques.
Passive collision avoidance methods include minimizing the size (cross section) of the
spacecraft, either by reducing the actual size or controlling the attitude to have a
smaller profile with respect to the debris impact directions. For most LEO spacecraft,
the normalized average relative impact rates by spacecraft surface are: 10 km/s for
leading edge + 45°, 2 km/s for surfaces 90° to the ram direction, | km/s for trailing
edge, 0.1 km/s for space pointing, and 0.01 km/s for Earth pointing surfaces. Operators

could also place the spacecraft in a less populated orbital regime; however, this is not
possible for most missions.

We may need active debris avoidance for critical space structures such as space
stations or satellite constellations. This requires active tracking of co-orbiting objects,
additional propellant, coordination with satellite tracking facilities (such as
USSPACECOM), and coordination with co-orbiting spacecraft operators. At the pres-
ent time, systems such as the International Space Station, the Space Shuttle, and LEO
satellite constellations are the only missions using or planning to use active collision
avoidance. The Shuttle has made several highly publicized maneuvers to avoid cata-
loged objects. Active avoidance is only practical for protection from the largest of
fragments and may still be suspect since ground-based tracking accuracy is poor for
most orbiting objects (unless the tracking system expends extra effort to update a
specific satellite). Thus, it is not a cost-effective option for most satellite operators at
this time.

Debris Mitigation

All space users have a responsibility to include debris mitigation techniques in their
mission profiles. As identified in Fig. 21-2, there are three phases where users can min-
imize the addition of debris to the environment. While non-governmental missions do
not have any debris mitigation regulations at this time, the U.S. Government requires
its missions to minimize debris [NSS 1740.14, 1995; NMI 1700.8, 1993]. Additional
regulations and guidelines are in work by both NASA and the UN.

Launch system designers should plan their scenarios to reduce launch-related
debris such as protective shrouds, separation devices and expended rocket bodies.
They should not allow this hardware to reach long-lived orbits. Historically, an
average of three large pieces of debris are produced from each successful mission.
However, the launch process probably generates many more nontrackable pieces.

As a Satellite is inserted into its final orbit, we should take care not to produce
debris during the last impulsive maneuvers. A major source of debris in the past was
exploding rocket stages. Some of these propulsion-related explosions occurred during
attempted burns while others resulted from inadvertent mixing of hypergolic fuels or

850 Limits on Mission Design

tank overpressurization years after the rocket’s last use. Designers corrected this
problem on many rocket bodies by venting the fuel or conducting an idle burn.

Before we declare a satellite operational, we must deploy its solar panels, uncover
its instruments, and stabilize its orientation. Given the present design of satellites, all
these activities may release hardware into space. As a Satellite operates and ages, paint
chips off and small pieces of hardware work themselves free, creating more orbital
debris.

Once that satellite or rocket body ceases to perform a useful purpose, we may
consider the entire system to be debris, and we should remove it for the sake of the
remaining operational payloads. We should add this mission termination phase to
the mission profile, using propulsive maneuvers to put it into a disposal orbit or re-
entry trajectory. We use disposal orbits mostly for GEO satellites, while reentry is
most economical for many LEO orbits. We must consider these maneuvers in the
design process to control the growth of orbital debris. Regardless of our regime, all
energy sources should be passivated (e.g., fuel and pressure tanks vented, batteries
safed, and momentum wheels despun).

The design decision in response to orbital debris is basically a cost balance between
design and risk costs. As discussed in Sec. 19.2, the risk cost is the expected cost of
failure. This value is simply the probability of a debris encounter causing a failure
times the cost to compensate for this failure. This may entail accepting degraded
performance or launching a substitute. A worsening debris environment may increase
the space segment failure probability (Sec. 19.2) which we can offset by changes in
design such as shielding, redundancy, or avoidance maneuvers. Each of these counter-
measures exact a financial burden of increased direct costs (design and manufacturing)
and indirect costs (launch and maintenance), yet may result in greater reliability for all
space systems.
