In the broadest sense, space propulsion systems do three things. They lift the launch
vehicle and its payload from the launch pad and place the payload into low-Earth orbit.
They transfer payloads from low-Earth orbits into higher orbits for mission operations
or into trajectories for planetary encounters. Finally, they provide thrust for attitude
control and orbit corrections. Table 17-1 lists the specific functions these systems
perform during various mission phases and some typical performance requirements.

. Performance requirements for propulsion systems include thrust, total impulse, and
duty cycle specifications derived from mission profiles. Individual designs must meet
other performance requirements, such as operating pressure, and internal and external
leakage. Other specifications include physical characteristics, propellant, and mass
properties. Configuration requirements include envelope dimensions, thruster loca-
tions, and alignment. In addition, plume efflux is frequently a design driver for
payloads sensitive to contamination.

Once a payload is placed in low-Earth orbit by the launcher, an upper stage or
onboard spacecraft integral propulsion system (see Table 17-2) is frequently used to
transfer the payload to its operational orbit. These in-space propulsion system designs,
especially their weight, size, and volume, are strongly driven by the performance and
weight efficiency of the primary propulsion system. The specific impulse, propellant
density, and overall stage mass fraction of the primary propulsion system are key
parameters. Table 18-5 in Sec. 18.2 summarizes key features and performance charac-
teristics of existing and planned upper stages for use with various launch vehicles.

With the heavy emphasis on driving down the cost of access to space, while still
staying within the capabilities of the current fleet of launch vehicles, many space
systems’ prime contractors are designing and emphasizing higher efficiency and

low-cost, onboard spacecraft integral propulsion systems (IPS). The functions of the
onboard IPS are to provide much of the propulsion energy for ascent from low-Earth
orbit to higher operational orbits and for controlled de-orbit/reentry at the end of
mission life, in addition to the normal on-orbit attitude and velocity control propulsion
functions. Spacecraft IPS have become almost routine for most designs. More than
85% of all spacecraft launched have operational orbits of greater than 500 km. In
addition, new international regulations make controlled de-orbit a mandatory require-
ment which increases the onboard IPS energy requirements.

With this need for higher onboard IPS propulsion energy almost all spacecraft
today employ one of three IPS designs or some combination: (1) storable bipropellant
(i.e., employing N.O4 and monomethylhydrazine, or MMH, as the propellants);
(2) Dual mode propulsion (employing N,O, and hydrazine as high performance

17.1 Propulsion Subsystem Selection and Sizing 687

bipropellants for AV and monopropellant attitude control); (3) one of several different
electric propulsion options, depending upon power available, burn time vs. weight
requirements and considerations such as propellant commonality, volume limitations
and electromagnetic issues. Typical spacecraft electric propulsion options are resisto-
jets (delivering ~300 sec I,, using decomposed hydrazine), arcjets (delivering
~500-700 sec Isp, using decomposed hydrazine or ammonia), Hall effect thrusters
(delivering ~1,500—2,000 sec Js, using Xenon and derived from Russian technology
applied to Russian satellites such as GALS and GONAS), and ion propulsion (delivers
~2,000-3,000 sec Isp, also using Xenon). As more and more of the orbit raising
impulse is incorporated on board the spacecraft instead of using a separate upper stage,
modern designs are typically using an optimized combination of chemical and electric
or hybrid onboard propulsion.

17.1 Propulsion Subsystem Selection and Sizing

The process for selecting and sizing the elements of the propulsion subsystem is
shown in Table 17-2. We must carefully estimate the key performance requirements
in steps 1 to 3 since they have the greatest impact on operation, weight, and cost. In
step 4 we identify as many reasonable options as possible, and pare the list down to a
few that have merit. We then proceed to step 5 to develop sufficient detail to estimate
the performance, mass, and cost of each option.

propellant-based systems have been used extensively for orbit insertion, but the space-
craft propulsion subsystem must be augmented with another technology to provide
orbit maintenance and attitude control. Liquid systems are divided into monopropel-
lant and bipropellant systems with a third alternative, dual mode, that is a bipropellant
derivative. Monopropellant systems have successfully provided orbit maintenance and
attitude control functions, but lack the performance to provide high efficiency large AV
maneuvers required for orbit insertion. Bipropellant systems are attractive because
they can provide all three functions with one higher performance system, but they are
more complex than the historic solid rocket and monopropellant combined systems.

Dual-mode systems are integrated mono and bipropellant systems fed by common
fuel tanks. These systems are actually hybrid designs that use hydrazine (N2H4) both
as a fuel for high performance bipropellant engines (i.e., N2>O4/N2H4) and as a mono-
propellant with conventional low-thrust catalytic thrusters. The hydrazine is fed to
both the bipropellant engines and the monopropellant thrusters from the common fuel
tank. In this manner, high specific impulse is provided for long AV burns at high thrust
(e.g., apogee circularization) and reliable, precise, minimum-impulse burns are pro-
vided by the monopropellant thrusters for attitude control. An additional capability to
enhance dual-mode propulsion is the development of a bimodal thrust device which
can operate either as a simple catalytic monopropellant thruster or as a high per-
formance bipropellant thruster known as the Secondary Combustion Augmented
Thruster or SCAT shown in Fig. 17-1.

Practical considerations may restrict the propellant choices to those that are readily
available, storable, and easy to handle. Also, we must trade the lead time needed to
develop new hardware against the combination of existing components or stages.
Finally, limits on payload acceleration may dictate the maximum permissible thrust
levels.

17.2 Basics of Rocket Propulsion

Two basic parameters of rocket engine design are thrust and specific impulse.
Thrust, F, is the amount of force applied to the rocket based on the expulsion of gases:

F= mv, +A,[B -B.]= nv, (17-1)

where A, is nozzle exit area, P, is the gas pressure at the nozzle exit, P, is the ambient
pressure, V, is propellant exhaust velocity, and m is propellant mass flow rate. We
simplify this expression by defining an effective exhaust velocity, C, as:

A
C=V, +—[R -R.] (17-2)
Equation (17-1) then reduces to:
F= mC (17-3)

At very high altitudes and in space, P, is essentially zero; at lower altitudes, a rocket
engine’s thrust increases with altitude until the vehicle leaves the atmosphere.

Specific impulse, I,,, is the ratio of the thrust, F, to the weight flow rate, mg, of
propellant.

ly = E/rhg (17-4)

Is is a measure of the energy content of the propellants, and how efficiently it is
converted into thrust. For a chemical rocket, Js, is directly proportional to the square
root of the ratio of the chamber temperature, T,, to the average molecular weight of the
exhaust gases, M, as follows:

Ip =KYT./M (17-5)

where K is a proportionality constant depending on the ratio of specific heats of the
exhaust gas and the engine pressure ratio. This important relationship shows that we
can maximize specific impulse by matching the highest possible total temperature
with the lowest average molecular weight of the combustion products.

690 Space Propulsion Systems 17.2

The primary measure of propulsion system performance capability is the velocity
change, AV, that it can produce. We quantify this relationship by the rocket equation:*

AV= gly fe] =g ly 2] = g 1, In(R) (17-6)
oP f

where my = m,—m,is the final vehicle mass, m, is the initial vehicle mass, m, is the
mass of the propellant consumed, and R = m,/m, is the mass ratio. This equation
assumes zero losses due to drag and gravity, and is thus a limiting ideal case. In prac-
tice, the AV achieved will be somewhat smaller. Gravity and drag losses for launch
vehicles are typically 1,500-2,000 m/s.

Another form of Eq. (17-6) provides the mass of propellant required for a given

increment of velocity, AV:

my = myo Ip) _ ] = mo ~ eV ") (17-7)

This equation allows us to calculate the mass of propellant required based on either the
initial or final mass of the rocket.

We obtain the highest thrust when exit pressure equals ambient pressure. Although
Eq. (17-1) suggests that greater thrust can be obtained with an exit pressure greater
than the ambient pressure, the exhaust velocity is reduced, resulting in a loss of thrust.
As a result, we design rocket exhaust nozzles with an exit pressure equal to the ambi-
ent pressure whenever possible. The exit pressure is governed by the nozzle-area
expansion ratio:

e=A,/A, (17-8)

where A, is the nozzle exit area and A, is the area of the throat of the nozzle. Note that
as the expansion ratio increases, the nozzle exit pressure decreases.

For launch vehicles (particularly first stages) where the ambient pressure varies
during the burn period, trajectory computations are performed to determine the opti-
mum exit pressure. However, an additional constraint is the maximum allowable
diameter for the nozzle exit cone, which in some cases is the limiting constraint. This
is especially true on stages other than the first, where the nozzle diameter may not be
larger than the outer diameter of the stage below.

For space engines, where the ambient pressure is zero, thrust is always higher with
larger nozzle expansion ratios. On these engines, we increase the nozzle expansion
ratio until the additional weight of the longer nozzle (and increase in real nozzle inter-
nal boundary layer or drag losses) costs more performance than the extra thrust it
generates.

Another important relationship for evaluating rocket performance involves two key
Figures of Merit, the characteristic velocity of the combustion gases and the thrust
coefficient. The characteristic velocity, C*, is a measure of the energy available from
the combustion process and is given by:

* The rocket equation was developed in the late nineteenth century and first published by Kon-
stantin Tsiolkovsky [1903], a deaf Russian schoolteacher who was the first to develop much
of the mathematical theory of modern rocketry. The most dramatic crater on the far side of the
Moon was named Tsiolkovsky following its discovery in 1959 by the Soviet probe Luna 3.

17.3 Types of Rockets 691

C* = FA, (17-9)
m
where A, is area of the nozzle throat, and P, is the combustion chamber pressure.
Delivered values of C* range from 1,333 m/s for monopropellant hydrazine (N»H,) to
1,640 m/s for Earth-storable bipropellants (N»O,/MMH) and up to 2,360 m/s for
cryogenic LO./LH>. The thrust coefficient, C,, is a measure of the efficiency of con-
verting the energy to exhaust velocity and characterizes the nozzle performance.

G = F (17-10)
P, cAy
Representative values for Cy are 1.6 (for nozzle expansion ratio, € =30:1) and 1.86
(for € = 200:1). The product of these two Figures of Merit, divided by the gravity
constant, gives the specific impulse:

Ip = F/mg = C* CG /2 (17-11)

The physical parameters that interact to produce hot gases and associated thrust inside
a chemical rocket chamber are illustrated in Fig. 17-2. Further information is given by
NASA [1963].

Fig. 17-2. Simplified Diagram of a Chemical Rocket. Combustion of fuel and oxidizer in the
combustion chamber produces expansion of the reaction product gases which are
then expelled through the nozzle. The differential between pressure inside the cham-
ber (P,) and at the nozzle exit (P,) produces a reaction that propels the chamber and
the vehicle in a direction opposite to that of the exhaust gases. Atmospheric pressure
(P.,) reduces the effective thrust (F), so that a rocket engine actually works more effi-
ciently in outer space than in the Earth’s atmosphere. This simplified combustion
chamber diagram is also representative of a monopropellant rocket (one fuel inlet only
and the upper portion of the chamber is packed with catalyst), and of a solid rocket
(where there are no inlets because both the fuel and oxidizer are preloaded in the
chamber and burn only upon command for ignition).

17.3 Types of Rockets

Currently available space propulsion systems can be categorized as either cold gas,
chemical, or electric. More exotic types, such as nuclear, solar sails or beamed-energy
approaches may be feasible someday, but their consideration is beyond the scope of
this book. Table 17-4 and Table 17-5 list the general characteristics of several types of
propulsion systems,

17.3 Types of Rockets 693

Cold gas propulsion is just a controlled, pressurized gas source and a nozzle. It
represents the simplest form of rocket engine. Cold gas has many applications where
simplicity is more important than high performance. The Manned Maneuvering Unit
used by astronauts is an example of such a system.

Chemical combustion systems are the most common systems for space applica-
tions. They can be divided into three basic categories: liquid, solid, and hybrid. The
terminology refers to the physical state of the stored propellants. Typically, rockets
using solid propellants are called motors and rockets using liquids are called engines
or thrusters.

17.3.1 Liquid Rockets

In a liquid rocket system propellants are stored as liquids in tanks and fed on
demand into the combustion chamber by gas pressurization or a pump. Bipropellant
engines chemically react a fuel and an oxidizer, and monopropellant engines catalyti-
cally decompose a single propellant. Bipropellant engines deliver a higher specific
impulse but involve additional system complexity and cost. Table 17-6 shows liquid
rocket engines used for upper stages or integral propulsion systems on spacecraft.

pressure-fed, uses Earth-storable propellants, and is designed for long life. This system
contains one 100-lbs, radiation-cooled liquid-fueled engine that uses Nj,O,4 and
monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellants. There are two positive expulsion tanks for
the fuel and two for the oxidizer. A pressurant tank stores helium at about 4,000 psia,

any single regulator failure. Both the fuel and oxidizer tanks can use propellant

direction and that the fuel and oxidizer can never mix anywhere in the system, except
in the engine. Finally, pressure transducers, filters, temperature sensors, and line and
component heaters are provided to ensure proper subsystem operation.

Another type of system uses a cryogenic topping cycle engine. The fuel first travels
through the thrust chamber’s cooling jacket in a technique known as regenerative
cooling. All of the fuel burns with part of the oxidizer in a high-pressure precombustor.
The combustion products provide high-energy gas to drive the engine pump turbines.
The total exhaust flow from the turbine is then injected into the main combustion
chamber, where it burns with the remaining oxidizer. Because of the precombustor, the
cycle lends itself to high-pressure operation, which results in a smaller thrust chamber.
The extra pressure drop in the precombustor and turbines requires the pump-discharge
pressure of both the fuel and the oxidizer to be much higher than with open-cycle
engines. The topping cycle therefore needs heavier and more complex pumps, tur-
bines, and piping. It can, however, provide the highest specific impulse for a given
propellant combination.

The Space Shuttle’s main engine uses a variation of the topping cycle by employing
two separate precombustion chambers, each mounted directly on a separate main
turbopump. The oxygen precombustor and turbopump burn an oxygen-rich mixture
that expands through the oxidizer turbine to drive the pump. Then the mixture enters
the main combustion chamber, where it burns with the fuel-rich mixture from the fuel-
precombustor and turbine assembly. The Space Shuttle’s main engine develops the
highest specific impulse (455 sec at vacuum) of any flight-proven rocket engine using
chemical] propulsion.

The expander cycle is somewhat different, in that the engine pump turbines are
driven by gaseous fuel which vaporizes in the thrust chamber cooling jacket. The
expander cycle requires no precombustor. An expander cycle engine is shown in
Fig. 17-4.

Liquid Monopropellant Engines. By far the most widely used type of propulsion
for spacecraft attitude and velocity control is monopropellant hydrazine (NjH,). Its
excellent handling characteristics, relative stability under normal storage conditions,
and clean decomposition products have made it the standard. The general sequence of
operations in a hydrazine thruster (Fig. 17-5) is:

Hydrazine (N
From Fuel Tank

When the attitude-control system signals for thruster operation, an electric-
solenoid valve opens, allowing hydrazine to flow. This action may be pulsed
(as short as 5 ms) or long duration (steady state).

The pressure in the propellant tank forces liquid hydrazine into the injector. It
enters as a spray into the thrust chamber and contacts the catalyst beds.

The catalyst bed consists of alumina pellets impregnated with iridium. The
most widely used catalyst, manufactured by Shell Oil Company, is called Sheil
405. Incoming liquid hydrazine heats to its vaporizing point by contact with
the catalyst bed and with the hot gases leaving the catalyst particles. The tem-
perature of the hydrazine rises to a point where the rate of its decomposition
becomes so high that the chemical reactions are self-sustaining.

By controlling the flow variables and the geometry of the catalyst chamber, a
designer can tailor the proportion of chemical products, the exhaust tempera-
ture, the molecular weight, and thus the enthalpy for a given application
(Fig. 17-5). For a thruster application where specific impulse is paramount, the
designer attempts to provide 30-40% ammonia dissociation, which is about
the lowest percentage that can be maintained reliably. For a gas-generator
application, where lower temperature gases are usually desired, the designer
provides for higher levels of ammonia dissociation.

Finally, in the space thruster, the hydrazine decomposition products leave the
catalyst bed and exit from the chamber through a high expansion ratio exhaust
nozzle to produce thrust.

Figure 17-6 shows a schematic of the monopropellant-hydrazine system used for

operates in a blowdown mode. For this operation, the propellant and pressurant gas are
stored in the same tank. As propellant is expelled from the tank, the pressure level
drops. The system has eight thrusters operating at a maximum thrust of 30 N for reac-
tion control and four thrusters operating at a maximum thrust of 535 N to adjust the
orbit and control altitude. Both sets of hydrazine thrusters are completely redundant
for all functions. Both use Shell 405 catalyst and operate as described above. The sys-
tem also has four large positive-expulsion tanks with elastomeric diaphragms, each
holding about 450 kg of hydrazine.

The system is completely two-fault tolerant (a Space Shuttle launch safety require-
ment) and therefore has three solenoid-latching isolation valves in series for every
flow “leg” (between tanks and any one thruster) for a total of 18 latching isolation
valves. They are called latching valves because they stay in whatever position they
were last commanded (that is, open or closed), therefore only requiring power for the
command period of approximately 200 ms. The system also has eight manual fill-and-
drain valves. Each tank has one propellant and one gas valve to load the hydrazine and
GN, pressurizing gas on their respective sides of the positive-expulsion tank. The
GRO propulsion system also has miscellaneous components such as filters (to keep
from contaminating the system), pressure transducers, temperature sensors, and ther-
mostatically controlled catalyst bed and line heaters. These heaters increase thruster
lifetime and prevent the propellant from freezing.

17.3 Types of Rockets 699

17.3.2 Solid Rockets

Solid rockets store propellants in solid form. The fuel is typically powdered
aluminum, and the oxidizer is ammonium perchlorate. A synthetic rubber such as
polybutadiene holds the fuel and oxidizer powders together. Though lower performing
than liquid rockets, the operational simplicity of a solid rocket motor often makes it
the propulsion system of choice. Table 17-7 gives representative examples of solid
rocket motors.

Figure 17-7 is a schematic diagram of a typical rocket motor using a solid propel-
lant. This motor, used for geosynchronous spacecraft, provides a circularizing burn
when the spacecraft is at apogee, thus placing the vehicle into its operating orbit. The
internal grain is shaped in a star configuration, so the grain’s surface area will remain
relatively constant as the motor burns. We often desire a constant burning area because
it produces relatively constant pressure (and thrust) over the full burn period for a pre-
dominantly radial burning motor. An igniter in the forward or head end of the motor
starts the burn on command from a control system. The igniter, when lit, sends burning
particles into the main motor grain. These burning particles fully ignite the rocket
motor. A solid motor typically operates with a single start and burns until the propel-
lant is gone [Timnat, 1987].

17.3.3 Hybrid Rockets

A hybrid rocket is one in which the propellants are stored in different forms. Nor-
mally, the fuel is a solid and the oxidizer is.a liquid or gas (Fig. 17-8). Hybrid rockets

have several attractive features. These include: (1) safety—it is impossible to create
an explosive mixture of fuel and oxidizer; (2) throttling—we can throttle the engine
by modulating the oxidizer flow rate (useful for load alleviation during maximum
dynamic pressure and for trajectory shaping). We can idle the engine also (10% thrust)
to ensure system operation prior to launch commit; (3) restart—we can shut it off and
restart it; (4) storability—the fuel is storable, as are many oxidizers; (5) environmen-
tally clean—unlike solid rockets, hybrids can be made which produce no hydrochloric
acid or aluminum oxide exhaust.

The California Rocket Society built hybrid rockets in the 1930s. The California-
based Pacific Rocket Society also conducted research in the mid-1940s, using liquid
oxygen with various fuels including wood, wax loaded with carbon black, and rubber.
The LOX-rubber combination was the most successful, and was test-flown to an
altitude of 9 km in June, 1951 [Altman, 1981].

17.3 Types of Rockets 701

ONERA in France developed a hybrid sounding rocket using amine fuel and nitric
acid oxidizer. The 3.3-m long, 75-kg rocket first flew in 1964. These flights continued
for three years, ultimately reaching altitudes in excess of 100 km [Salmon, 1968]. At
the same time, United Technologies and Beach Aircraft developed a high-altitude
supersonic target drone using H7PB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) fuel and
IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid) oxidizer. This air-launched Sandpiper mis-
sile (later renamed HAST) first flew in 1968 and had a range in excess of 150 km
[Altman, 1981].

Hybrid rocket technology has progressed slowly since the 1960s. As of 1990,
engines with thrust levels of 75,000 Ib have been demonstrated in ground tests [Guth-
rie and Wolf, 1990]. Engines with thrust of 3,000,000 lb, have been proposed, but sig-
nificant technical hurdles remain before such large hybrids will be feasible [Jensen,
1990]. Table 17-8 gives characteristics of several hybrid rockets.

Electric propulsion uses externally provided electrical power either from the Sun
(converted through photovoltaic solar arrays—100% to date) or from nuclear or
thermodynamic conversion thermal engines, to accelerate the working fluid to
produce useful thrust. For example, in an ion engine, an electric field accelerates
charged particles which exit at high velocity. Alternatively, in a magnetoplasmady-
namic, or MPD thruster, a current-carrying plasma interacts with a magnetic field
resulting in a Lorentz acceleration to expel the plasma.

17.3.4 Electric Propulsion

702 Space Propulsion Systems 17.3

There is no fundamental limit (other than the speed of light) to the exhaust velocity
that we can obtain with an electric rocket. However, the power required may grow to
the point where further acceleration is pointless. There is therefore an optimum
exhaust velocity, and hence an optimum specific impulse, which depends largely on
the electric power subsystem [Stuhlinger, 1964].

The propulsion system weight varies with the specific impulse (exhaust velocity),
thrust level, and total impulse. Propellant weight clearly drops off as specific impulse
increases. The power source requirements, however, are proportional to J,,,. Thus, the
weight of the power source increases with specific impulse, leading to a minimum
weight of the combined system (fuel and power source) at a particular value of I,,,. We
may usually obtain cost savings by operating slightly below the optimum specific
impulse, since propellant is usually cheaper than more power supply.

For an electric propulsion device, efficiency is defined as the ratio of kinetic energy
expelled to the input energy. For small time intervals, where mass flow is constant, we
express efficiency, 7, as a power ratio:

2
__ nv (17-12)
"=P

where 7 is the overall efficiency, m is mass flow rate, v is exhaust velocity, and P is
the input power. Recognizing that thrust F = mv, and that specific impulse J, =
F/mg , where g is the gravitational constant, we rearrange Eq. (17-12) to get power
required:

F? _ Fly (17-13)
2mn 2n

For a given J,, and thrust, we use Eq. (17-13) to estimate power and mass flow rate
of the working fluid. Typical values of 7 are included in Table 17-4, which also
includes useful information on selected propellants and energy sources. See Sec. 11.4
for more on the power subsystem, or Clark [1975].

Electric Propulsion Systems Design Concepts

The five electric propulsion (EP) concepts shown on Tables 17-9 and 17-10 have
achieved operational status and many programs are underway to increase the number
and types of missions served by EP. The following will briefly highlight the char-
acteristics of mature EP systems that have become operational, or for which near-
term flight programs are firmly planned, and comment on the potentials of various
classes of EP systems. Table 17-9 illustrates the three basic types of electrical energy
thrusters. Table 17-10 and Fig. 17-9 show key characteristics of selected, mature EP
systems. Figure 17-10 illustrates the fundamental concepts that enable operations for
all electric propulsion systems. To mitigate the effects of mission specifics, the system
specific mass (in kg/kW) only includes the mass of the thruster and power processor.
(The masses of the propellant subsystem, gimbals, and other mission specifics are not
included.)

Resistojets have been used for North-South stationkeeping and orbit insertion of,
respectively, communications satellites in the United States and for orbit control and
ACS functions on Russian spacecraft. Propellant temperatures are fundamentally
determined by material limits in resistojets which implies modest (propellant specific)
maxima for specific impulses of about 300 sec for the 0.5—1 kW-class resistojets

developed by Primex. Resistojets have several desirable features including values of
thrust/power far higher than other EP options (due to their high efficiencies and
modest specific impulses), the lowest EP system dry masses (primarily due to the lack
of a requirement for a power processor), and uncharged/benign plumes. These features
will continue to make resistojets attractive for low-to-modest energy applications,
especially where power limits and/or thrusting times, and/or plume impacts are
mission drivers. In addition, resistojets can operate on a wide variety of propellants
which led to their proposed use as a propulsion/waste gas management concept on
Space Station and, operated on hydrogen, for Earth-orbit insertions.

Table 17-10 shows three low-power arcjets. The two hydrazine concepts are pro-
duced by Primex and are being used for stationkeeping. The ammonia version was
supplied by the Institut fur Raumfahrt Systeme and the Institut fur Thermodynamik
und Technische Gebaudeausrustung in Germany and will be used for orbit raising and
inclination change of a German amateur radio spacecraft. Arcjets have about twice the
specific impulse of resistojets while maintaining some desirable features such as use
of standard propellants and relatively low dry masses. The increased specific impulse,
coupled with relatively low efficiencies of about 0.3 to 0.4, lead to significant
decreases (> 6X) of thrust/power relative to resistojets. In addition, as complex
plasma/arc phenomena must be controlled, arcjets require relatively complex power
conditioning which results in dry masses about twice those of resistojet systems.

Significant efforts including development of novel materials were necessary to define
and validate the 600-sec, hydrazine arcjet. It is likely, therefore, that 600-650 sec rep-
resents the upper range of specific impulses that can be expected of low-power arcjets
using storable propellants. Arcjets do provide major mass benefits for many space-
craft, are relatively simple to integrate, and are the least complex and costly of any
plasma propulsion device. For those reasons, low-power arcjets can be expected to
undergo evolutionary improvements and be used well into the future for a variety of
medium-to-high energy propulsion functions. Figure 17-11 also shows a 26 kW,
ammonia arcjet which operates at a specific impulse of 800 sec. The arcjet is part of a
flight system called ESEX, built under a U.S. Air Force program by a TRW, Primex,
and CTA Systems team, which includes the arcjet, supporting subsystems, and a diag-
nostic suite to evaluate plume and EMI effects. The increased specific impulse relative
to low-power arcjets is largely due to reduction of losses associated with low Reynolds
number flows that are fundamental penalties for low-power arcjets. The space test will
represent a greater than tenfold increase in power level of flight-demonstrated EP
devices and will address integration and mission issues critical to potential users of
high-power (orbit-transfer-class) electric propulsion.

Pulsed plasma thrusters (PPTs) are inherently pulsed devices and versions which
operate at about 847 sec specific impulse and were built by the Johns Hopkins
University, Applied Physics Laboratory (JIHU/APL) have successfully maintained
precision control of three NOVA spacecraft for many years. PPTs feature very small
(< 4 x 10-4N:s) impulse bit capability, use of a solid propellant (Teflon), and the
ability to operate at near constant performance over large power ranges. An improved

version PPT which operates up to 1,200 sec specific impulse (Table 17-9), is being.
developed by a NASA/Primex team and a flight test in 1999 is planned on the Earth
Observer 1 spacecraft to demonstrate propulsive ACS. The characteristics of PPTs
will likely limit their power operating range to under a few hundred watts and, as sug-
gested by Table 17-10, they have large dry masses. Within their operating capability,
however, PPTs promise a combination of low-power, high specific impulse, and
small-impulse bit that is unique. It is anticipated that PPTs will find uses for ACS and
for modest energy AV applications for small spacecraft where the power and thrust
limitations of PPTs are acceptable and/or desirable.

Hall effect thrusters (HETs) and ion thrusters (ITs) represent the highest perfor-
mance EP options and characteristics of mature versions of both concepts are shown
in Table 17-10. HETs were developed and flown on dozens of Russian space missions
for various functions and are under intense development for use on other nations’
spacecraft. Flight-type HETs have been produced by Fakel Enterprise (Fakel), Kel-
dysh Research Center (KeRC), and TSNIIMASH, all of Russia, and quite aggressive
HET R&D programs are in place in Europe, Japan, and the U.S. Table 17-10 lists three
HET concepts to illustrate the state-of-the-art. The 1,600 sec specific impulse concept
was developed to flight ready status by a team including International Space Technol-
ogy, Inc., Loral, and Fakel; the 1,638 sec Isp device was built, qualified, and delivered
for flight test (at reduced levels of power and specific impulse) by a NASA, Primex,
TSNIIMASH team; and the high power HET is being built by Space Power Inc. and
KeRC for a 1999 flight test on a Russian GEOSAT. In addition, two versions of

17.3 Types of Rockets 707

1.5 kW-class HETs traceable to the Fakel concept, are planned to provide stationkeep-
ing for nine years on the French Stentor spacecraft. Table 17-11 summarizes the status
of HETs.

Five mature ion thrusters are also shown on Table 17-10. The 2,585 sec Isp system
was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company and is operational on a commercial
COMSAT launched in 1997. The 2,906 sec J, concept was built by a team of Mitsu-
bishi Electric Corporation and Toshiba Corporation of Japan and was flown on the
ETS-VI spacecraft in 1994. An orbit insertion issue prevented the system from
performing its planned stationkeeping function but in-space characterizations were
performed in 1995 and an identical system will soon be flown on the Japanese
COMETS spacecraft. The 3,250 and 3,400 sec I, systems were built in Europe by
teams headed by, respectively, Matra Marconi Space (MMS) and DASA. These de-
vices have been baselined for stationkeeping on the European Space Agency’s
Artemis spacecraft to be launched in 2000. The 3,280 sec, 2.5 kW device is the highest
power, mature ion thruster for which data is available and is used on NASA’s New
Millennium DS-1 mission.

HETs and ITs are the highest specific impulse options available for mission
planners, and many analyses have been conducted to evaluate their use for high energy
missions. Comparisons of the two devices are difficult due to the relative lack of
maturity of devices built to comparable powers and standards. ITs operate reliably at
higher specific impulses than HETs and their performance and specific mass are
deeply penalized by operation at specific impulses less than about 2,500 sec, due to
the constraints imposed by the ion optics systems. On the other hand, HET systems
perform at values of thrust/power 30% or more larger than those of ITs and are con-
siderably lighter but HET operations above about 2,500 sec will pose major lifetime,
or redesign challenges. Both concepts eject high-velocity, charged plumes and present


708 Space Propulsion Systems 17.4

approximately the same issues regarding spacecraft integration. Both HETs and ITs
provide extreme benefits for emerging space missions and the choice between them
will likely be quite mission specific. In general, however, ITs become increasingly
beneficial as mission energies increase and HETs appear optimum for many time-
constrained situations, typical of Earth-space missions.

17.4 Component Selection and Sizing

The simplest way to feed the propellant (or working fluid) to the thrust chamber on
demand is to displace it from its storage vessels with a high-pressure gas. Alternative
systems employ a pump, such as a piston or turbopump, which can be driven by tur-
bines, gas pressure intensifiers, or directly by electric motors. Turbine-driven pump
assemblies may obtain drive power either from a hot-gas cycle (the most common
method) or, in a few cases, from electromechanical actuators that in turn receive power
from batteries or solar arrays. A feed system using intensified gas pressure may soon
find application in propulsion systems.

We typically use pressure-fed systems for rockets which deliver low to moderate
levels of thrust and total impulse (see Fig. 17-12). The simplified propellant feed
system reduces the overall weight of the propulsion systems. This simplicity, often
resulting in increased reliability, is particularly attractive for spacecraft applications.
However, as total impulse and/or thrust requirements increase, the weight of the
propellant tanks may become prohibitive. This is because the propellant tanks for a
pressure-fed system have to withstand a pressure somewhat higher than the engine
combustion pressure, thus they tend to be heavier than those for pump-fed systems.
Pump-fed systems are definitely lighter for applications using high thrust and longer
total burn, such as for launch vehicles or large upper stages [Fritz and Sackheim,
1982]. Because of these variables, we must conduct design studies and trade-offs to
select the best propellant feed approach. The next section includes schematic diagrams
of typical liquid-propulsion systems using pressure or pump-fed systems. Sutton
[1992] provides a more detailed discussion of turbopump assemblies.

For gas storage systems, only the pressure vessel, valving, and feed plumbing are
required to direct the gaseous propellants under high pressure to the thrust chamber.
Liquid storage systems are more complex, needing to manage the liquid propellant
under zero gravity to ensure that liquid, rather than gas or vapor, is expelled from the
tank. To manage the liquid propellant, we may use artificial gravity induced by a spin-
ning spacecraft or by a settling burn from another small rocket, positive expulsion, or
a surface-tension device. Positive expulsion systems use an active element (a bladder,
diaphragm, piston, or bellows) to separate the pressurant gas from the liquid
propellants under all dynamic conditions and to force the liquid from the tank into the
feed lines on demand. The slightly higher differential gas pressure acting on the expul-
sion device forces the liquid to flow. Table 17-12 shows basic options using a positive
expulsion tank.

710 Space Propulsion Systems 17.4

Surface tension systems passively manage propellants in a near zero-gravity
environment by using vanes, screens, or sponges to wick the propellant into the
propellant-tank outlets. In this manner the pressurizing gas bubble is always main-
tained in the center of the tank. All of these devices rely on surface tension forces to
separate liquids from gases [Martin, 1986].

Depending upon the specific mission requirements, a spacecraft can employ from
a few to as many as 30 thrust units. These thrusters may have to generate long, steady-
state burns for velocity control maneuvers to adjust or maintain the orbit. They may
also fire in short pulses of several milliseconds each to control attitude and manage
momentum. In some applications, an attitude-control thruster may have to deliver in
excess of a million pulses over its lifetime. This wide range of operating conditions
places great demands on propulsion systems that control the attitude and velocity of
spacecraft. Thus, designers of these thrusters place at least as much emphasis on oper-
ating life as on performance. In fact, in some cases absolute performance is secondary
to requirements for extended lifetimes and reliability. Table 17-13 presents operating
and performance specifications for typical flight-qualified attitude and velocity con-
trol thrusters.

Some means of directing the thrust vector may be required to ensure that the thrust
vector points through the spacecraft’s center of mass. This system must account for
center-of-mass shifts as propellant burns and allow for necessary manufacturing toler-
ances. If the disturbance torques resulting from a misaligned thrust vector are small,
the spacecraft’s reaction-control system (that is, pulsing thrusters) can overcome them.
In other cases, the entire vehicle may be spun intentionally during firings of the main
engine to cancel out any misalignment of rocket thrust. If not, we may gimbal the large
rocket or only its nozzle. Alternatively, several rocket clusters may provide the main
thrust, with opposing rockets turned off briefly to compensate for the disturbance
torques. Similarly, we can use a rocket engine’s shallow-throttling ability to modulate
its disturbances relative to any opposing rocket in the cluster.

Other techniques for thrust-vector control, such as exhaust-jet deflectors (vanes or
tabs), are not as common as the ones mentioned above for exoatmospheric use.
Table 17-14 lists some representative values for the range of control authority that we
can achieve with various techniques for controlling the thrust vector.

To design a propulsion system, we must analyze requirements, trade off design
features, and size the system iteratively until we arrive at the best configuration for a
particular mission. Analyzing requirements includes performance, interfaces, and
physical characteristics. Design trades investigate different types of propulsion
systems, selection criteria, and design factors for the specific mission. Using sizing
calculations, interface considerations, and safety criteria, we determine the types and
quantities of propellants and pressurants, as well as how to configure the tanks, com-
ponents, instrumentation, and power conditioning (if applicable). All choices must
meet design requirements within suitable margins.

The total impulse that the propulsion system must deliver derives from the velocity
increment (AV) it must impart to the spacecraft for maneuvers, the impulse required
by the attitude-control system for limit cycling and managing momentum, and the
spacecraft’s weight. The allowable offset for center-of-mass affects the number and
location of propellant tanks (or solid rockets), which usually occupy most of the pro-
pulsion system’s volume. The ranges for maximum acceleration establish criteria for
thruster sizing, whereas duty cycling determines the type, response time, and operating
thermal characteristics of thrusters. Lifetime affects component selections. For

example, thrusters are designed and qualified for specific operating lifetimes. Mainte-
nance, or maximum interval for resupply, affects propellant loads and tank sizing.

The propellant budget must include enough propellant to correct for errors stem-
ming from injection dispersion. Both the number and accuracy of maneuvers affect the
reserves that must be carried. When a solid rocket performs a AV maneuver, especially
a solid rocket restricted to a single firing, off-nominal performance will result in posi-
tion errors and on-orbit velocity errors. For example, the Inertial Upper Stage has a
three-sigma, geosynchronous position error of 43 km and a velocity error of 6 m/s.

For a typical design, we first size the propellant load based on the information pro-
vided in Table 10-7 of Chap. 10. For initial sizing, we may consider only the first two
items. Using the rocket equation presented in Sec. 17.2 (Eq. 17-6), we estimate the
propellant load, m,, from total impulse requirements:

My = 1118 Igy (17-14)

where J, is total impulse, /,, is the specific impulse, and g is the universal gravity con-
stant 32.17 ft/s2. Knowing the propellant mass, we can determine the propellant vol-
ume by dividing by propellant density. For gaseous propellant, density should be at the
storage pressure and maximum anticipated temperature.

Besides expelled propellant mass, many other things contribute to the weight of
propulsion systems. Some examples are thrusters, tanks, fluid components, instrumen-
tation, lines, fittings, power conditioning equipment, dedicated power equipment,
pressurant, and residual propellants (depending upon propulsion type). Initial sizing
should take into‘account known hardware weights. Table 17-13 summarizes some rep-
resentative, flight-qualified, spacecraft thrusters. We should use similar data to select
flight-qualified, off-the-shelf hardware that are close to meeting mission requirements.
A schematic or functional block diagram (see Sec. 17.2) builds on the basic concept
and size, as do the equipment list and weight summary. For a conceptual design, we
may use the methods outlined below.

We usually size solid propellant systems so that each motor in the system provides
the total impulse for a single maneuver. Thus, we need only know the mass fraction of
each motor to calculate total system weight, because the weight of the other hardware
-—such as the safe-and-arm device, explosive transfer assembly, and initiators—is
usually small by comparison. Solid rocket motors are typically over 90% propellant
by mass, including case and nozzle assemblies. A value from 91-94% is reasonable
for present-day solid rocket motors with total impulse greater than 450,000 N<s.

17.4 Component Selection and Sizing 713

Improvements in materials of construction should increase this value to more than
95% by the mid-1990s.

For liquid propulsion systems, we size the tank after determining the propellant
load because the tanks are the largest and heaviest components. For bipropellant sys-
tems, we determine the oxidizer and fuel requirements from:

O/F = tg, tipyet (17-15)

where O/F is the mixture ratio needed to deliver the required specific impulse, m,, is
the oxidizer mass, and my,,; is the mass of the fuel. We calculate tank volumes from
propellant volumes loaded into each tank, plus reasonable allowances for ullage (gas
volume in the propellant tank, approximately 5%), design margin, and propellant
remaining in each tank because of trapped liquids or uncertainties in loading and
performance. The mixture ratio is a critical parameter in propulsion system sizing;
therefore, its selection is the first step in determining the propellant quantities for a
given set of propulsion-system requirements (total impulse). Very often, we select the
mixture ratio for system benefits other than just maximum /,,. Consider the example
of storable-bipropellant systems using N.O,/MMH for space systems. They almost
always use an O/F ratio of 1.64 because this value results in tanks of equal size. Equal
sizing simplifies tank manufacturing, packaging of propulsion systems (configuration
layout), and integration.
The O/F ratio at which the engine is operating is defined as:

OIF = ting, Ite (17-16)

where 7, is the oxidizer mass flow rate, and "yuei is the fuel flow rate. The
maximum theoretical value of the characteristic exhaust velocity, C*, is achieved at a
specific mixture ratio. This optimum O/F ratio depends on the particular propellant
combination. Usually, we choose the O/F ratio so that the reaction products have the
maximum achievable value of T,/M and thus the highest possible specific impulse
[Gordon and McBride, 1976].

In some situations a different O/F ratio results in a better overall system. For a
volume-constrained vehicle with a low density fuel such as liquid hydrogen, we can
significantly reduce vehicle size by shifting to an oxidizer-rich O/F ratio. In this case,
the losses in specific impulse are more than compensated for by the reduced fuel tank-
age requirement, because combustion performance is not a particularly strong function
of mixture ratio. A large orbital transfer vehicle transported to orbit by the Space Shut-
tle would use this type of mixture ratio, though there may be other situations as well.

Pressurant gas requirements depend on the type of pressurization system
employed—regulated or blowdown (Fig.17-12), or some combination of the two.
About 5% to 10% ullage is provided in the propellant tanks for pump-fed or regulated
pressure systems.The total propellant tank volume for a blowdown system is the total
of the propellant volume, V> and initial gas volume, Veis in the tank. They relate
through the blowdown ratio, R, as follows:
where Vy is the final gas volume, neglecting the propellant volume remaining at
end-of-life as well as density changes with temperature. Design margin for liquid pro-
pellant loads depends on the mission but can be as high as 25% for early conceptual

714 Space Propulsion Systems 17.4

designs. Analyzing the residual propellant can get very detailed, involving statistical
and deterministic error sources. A reasonable initial estimate is 5%.

For most systems, we can determine pressurant mass from the perfect gas law, but
only when the propellant is withdrawn isothermally (in blowdown systems at low duty
cycles). Otherwise, calculating requirements for pressurant mass of regulated systems
can become complicated thermodynamically. Using a conservation-of-energy approx-
imation to calculate the pressurant mass yields the following relationship:

war k
Mgi = (17-18)
"RT; [1-(B/F)
where m,; is the initial pressurant mass, Pp and Vp are instantaneous gas pressure and

gas volume in the propellant tank, P, (300-600 psia) and P; (3,000-6,000 psia) are
instantaneous gas pressure and initial gas pressure in the pressurant tank, respectively;
T; is initial gas temperature (275-300 K); k is specific heat ratio for a pressurant gas
(1.40 for nitrogen, 1.67 for helium); and R is the pressurant gas constant (296.8
J/(kg:K) for nitrogen, 2077.3 J/(kg-K) for helium).

This equation does not apply to very high storage pressures, for which the com-
pressibility factor becomes important. A more complete solution and derivation is in
Sutton [1992].

We may estimate the propellant and pressurant gas tank weights using:

o= a (cylindrical) (17-19)
and:
o= on (spherical) (17-20)

where o is the allowable stress from Table 11-52," p is the maximum expected
operating préssure, r is the tank radius, and t is tank wall thickness. Usually, we select
the material, estimate the tank size, determine the thickness from Eq. (17-19) or
(17-20), and then compute the tank weight using the density of the material selected.
For typical spacecraft propulsion, the tank weight will be about 5-15% of the propel-
lant weight, depending on the basic design, safety factors, and construction materials.
We must add 20-30% of the overall tank weight for mounting hardware and propellant
management devices. See Sec. 11.6 for more detail.

We can estimate total weight of the liquid-propulsion system in a similar manner
as for solid systems by estimating the fraction of the propulsion system mass that is
propellant. Liquid propulsion systems are typically 85-93% propellant by mass, with
the remainder consisting of pressurant, thrusters, tanks, fluid components, lines,
fittings, and instrumentation. This fuel mass fraction, however, can be considerably
lower in small systems. The higher fuel mass fractions are usually associated with
large propellant loads and use of composite, overwrapped tanks. These tanks are
fabricated with advanced materials which have higher strength-to-weight ratios. An
example would be thin, metal-lined tanks using an overwrapping of high-strength
carbon fibers, such as graphite-epoxy.

* Use the column labeled “F,,, = Allowable Tensile Ultimate Stress” plus a safety factor.

17.4 Component Selection and Sizing 715

A significant part of the weight in cold gas propulsion systems is in the high-
pressure tanks needed for storing the gaseous propellant. These systems most often
appear in applications demanding low total impulse or extreme sensitivity to
contamination. In this case, we can estimate tank weight with the aid of Eqs. (17-19)
and (17-20). For example, the propulsion system which uses a nitrogen propellant for
the Orbital Maneuvering Unit has a mass fraction (ratio of propellant mass to propul-
sion system mass) of 0.64. Thirty-five percent of its dry weight is in nitrogen gas
tankage.

Thruster design requires specialized development to produce the best performance,
life, chamber pressure, and expansion ratio. Often, existing thrusters can provide a
basis for initial sizing. Sizes for fluid components (especially valves), as well as lines
and fittings, develop from flow-rate requirements, which depend on the number of
thrusters involved and the definition of specific impulse given in Sec. 17.2. Pressure
drops across fluid components also depend on flow rates. A pressure schedule starts
with requirements of the thruster’s inlet pressure and works up through the pressure
drops in each sequential component to the propellant and pressurant tanks.

To design a propulsion system, we must consider some additional special topics:
interactions with the rocket exhaust plume, staging, maneuver accuracy, and thrust-
vector control. Rocket exhaust plumes present three basic design issues. The first is
plume heating of surfaces next to the rocket. The second concerns forces and moments
that the plume places on the spacecraft. For example, thrusters that control inclination
on geostationary satellites can lose about 10% of their delivered thrust because of
plume drag on the solar arrays. To avoid this drag, we must mount the thrusters far
from the solar array axis or cant them away from the arrays. The applied thrust vector
is then degraded by the cosine of the thruster cant angle, because the applied thrust is
no longer normal to the vehicle. A third issue concerns contamination by the plume.
Depending on the propellants involved and the nature of their exhaust products, the
plume may contaminate sensitive surfaces (such as optics or thermal control surfaces)
of both the host and nearby spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle or, eventually, the
space station.

Rocket-plume exhausts divide into three regions: a continuous, forward-directed
core flow; a transition region; and a rarefied backflow regime. By carefully placing
thrusters on the spacecraft, we can usually avoid the first two regions. Avoiding back-
flow effects is difficult, but we can reduce them with large separation distances, plume
shields, covers on sensitive surfaces, and operational constraints on thruster firings.
Determining plume effects in specific applications may require extensive analytical
modeling supported by selected test data [Furstenau, McCoy, and Mann, 1980].

Optimizing weight for a given space propulsion system depends upon its type and
specific operating parameters. Typically, for a system using a cold gas or pressure-fed
liquid chemical, thrust-chamber pressure is the key to establishing its weight. Increas-
ing the chamber pressure in a system design and trade study produces several effects.
The engine will tend to be smaller and perform better because of increased area ratio
and, to a much lesser extent, improved chemical kinetics (combustion efficiency).
Therefore, the engine weight and propellant quantity will tend to decrease. But the
propellant tank, components, and plumbing weights will increase because of the
higher level of operating pressure required to force-feed propellants to the system, its
components, and into the thrust chamber. The thrust chamber operates at some nomi-
nal pressure, which adds resistance by acting as a back pressure. Thus, for a given set
of design and operating conditions, we can find an optimum design point for chamber

716 Space Propulsion Systems 17.5

pressure that results in a minimum weight for the propulsion system. For a turbopump-
fed system, the weight of the feed system upstream of the pump inlet will not depend
on the chamber pressure, so we can obtain the best size and pressure for the thrust
chamber without considering the rest of the system. In this case, as mentioned earlier,
we would trade the weight of a turbopump assembly against the weight of the
pressure-fed components to determine which approach is better for a given propulsion
system.

17.5 Staging

Multistage rockets allow improved payload capability for vehicles with a high AV
requirement such as launch vehicles or interplanetary spacecraft. In a multistage
rocket, propellant is stored in smaller, separate tanks rather than a larger single tank as
in a single-stage rocket. Since each tank is discarded when empty, energy is not
expended to accelerate the empty tanks, so a higher total AV is obtained. Alternatively,
a larger payload mass can be accelerated to the same total AV. For convenience, the
separate tanks are usually bundled with their own engines, with each discardable unit
called a stage.

The same rocket equation as single-stage rockets describes multistage rocket per-
formance, but must be determined on a stage-by-stage basis. The velocity increment,
AV,, for each stage is calculated as before:

m .
AV, = 8 Isp i ma (17-21)
t

where m,; represents the total vehicle mass when stage i ignites, and mi is the total
vehicle mass when stage i burns out but is not yet discarded. We must always realize
that the payload mass for any stage consists of the mass of all subsequent stages plus
the payload. Then, the total velocity increment for the vehicle is the sum of those for
the individual stages:

n
AVsorat = AV, + AVy +--+ AV, = DY AV; (17-22)
is]
where 7 is the total number of stages.
We define the payload fraction A as the ratio of payload mass, Mp, tO initial mass,
m,. We do this for the overall vehicle:

A= My / my (17-23)
or for each individual stage:
A= Mil, I Moi (17-24)

where the subscript i indicates the stage number. Recall that the payload for each stage
includes the mass of all subsequent stages. The overall vehicle payload fraction is then
the product of those for the individual stages:

A= Ay dyed, =] YA: (17-25)

i=l

References 717

Another required definition is the structure fraction:

€, =m, /m,, =m, ;/|m,, +m,; + m,y;| (17-26)
where m, = Mp— My = My m, and m, is the propellant mass.
Note that the mass ratio, Re from n Eq, (17- 6) i is related to the payload and structure

fractions as follows:

1
Rr Aj + €si (17-27)

i

Thus we can determine AV, for any stage knowing Isp, A;, and &,;.

We say a multistage vehicle with identical specific impulse, payload fraction and
structure fraction for each stage has similar stages. For such a vehicle, we maximize
the payload fraction by having each stage provide the same velocity increment. We
calculate the payload fraction for each stage by:

Ai = 2 (Mott! ep) -€ (17-28)
and the overall vehicle payload fraction by:
A=(A;)" (17-29)

For a multistage vehicle with dissimilar stages the overall vehicle payload fraction
depends on how we partition the AV requirement among stages. We reduce payload
fractions when we partition the AV suboptimally. Techniques have been developed
which yield an analytical solution for the optimal AV distribution [Hill and Petersen,
1970], or we may determine the optimal distribution by trial and error. In the latter
approach, a AV distribution is postulated and the resulting payload fraction calculated
as previously outlined. We have to vary the AV distribution until the payload fraction
is maximized. Once we select the AV distribution, we size the vehicle by starting with
the uppermost or final stage (whose payload is the payload) and calculating the initial
mass of this assembly. This assembly then forms the payload for the previous stage
and the process repeats until all stages are sized.

Results reveal that to maximize the payload fraction for a given AV requirement:

1. Stages with higher Jsp should be above stages with lower Isp.
2. More AV should be provided by the stages with the higher Jsp.
3. Each succeeding stage should be smaller than its predecessor.
4. Similar stages should provide the same AV.
