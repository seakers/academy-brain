Until about 1990, conventional satellite technology focused on relatively small
numbers of highly capable, complex spacecraft. Recently, spacecraft have become
more diverse, with the largest spacecraft now complimented by new systems using a
larger number of smaller spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. While these are lower cost than
their predecessors, this chapter focuses on the lowest tier of spacecraft cost to examine
the particular methods and attributes characteristic of minimum-cost spacecraft. In
certain applications these lower cost, smaller, simpler spacecraft are more effective.
We will examine the tradeoffs between conventional technology and what is now
referred to as miniature satellite technology or microspace. We will also consider the
most successful applications for minimum cost spacecraft technology, as well as how
engineering of low-cost and miniature spacecraft differs from that of conventional
devices, Because modern, low-cost spacecraft design is a rapidly evolving technology,
there are few references. We have included an annotated bibliography as a guide to
further reading.

Ever since Sputnik in 1957 and Explorer in 1958, spacecraft developers have built
small, simple systems alongside large, conventional satellites. Miniature satellites fill
specific niches, especially for short-term missions with few users. A miniature satel-
lite typically weighs less than 200 kg, has a shorter mission lifetime requirement, and
is put together quickly by a small team. With less money invested, and because a
minimum cost spacecraft has far fewer components and lower complexity, a user can
sanction more liberal engineering designs and be more willing to use newer, less
expensive technology, such as more contemporary electronic components or fabrica-
tion techniques.

The main advantages of miniature satellites are decreased costs and production
times. Military, university, commercial, and institutional space programs sometimes
cannot afford large, conventional spacecraft or take the time needed to build and
Jaunch them.

854 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft

Since they provide fewer, more modest on-orbit abilities, miniature products have
much simpler system architectures. They achieve reliability through simplicity rather
than through expensive, redundant components. They can be much smaller and lighter
than conventional products, thus reducing launch costs, which typically constitute half
the cost of a satellite system on orbit. Very small devices can often fill small spaces
available on large launchers. For ground transportation, one person can often carry a
small satellite in a car or on an airline seat.

Military applications of larger spacecraft are vulnerable to failure during launch or
on orbit, as well as to aggressive acts. We currently address these weaknesses mainly
with redundant subsystems, highly reliable components, and defensive counter-
measures, all of which add cost and size. A miniature technology approach would be
to create many small, relatively vulnerable spacecraft, providing the same ability but
a more difficult target.

Small size is not in itself a new feature. The earliest satellites were very small out
of necessity, weighing 5 to 50 kg. In retrospect, it is remarkable how large satellites
have grown, not how small a few satellites are. Table 22-1 surveys a sample of the
small satellites launched from 1991 to 1995. Since 1957, larger systems, made possi-
ble by advances in the technology of satellites and launch vehicles, have absorbed the
most engineering attention and resources. However, the continuity in their launch
dates shows that small satellites have played a role throughout satellite history, and are
still useful in specific applications.

856 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft

Early Space Systems

The earliest satellites were small because the first launch vehicles’ payloads were
limited. The satellites often had lifetimes limited by on-board battery power because
they had no solar panels. They carried either simple analog transponders or simple
beacons for researching signal propagation. The Echo series were passive reflectors
formed of metallized polymer balloons.

Virtually all of today’s satellite applications appeared in the first 10 years of
satellite development. For example, the Telstar series first demonstrated television and
telephone relay. In size, mass, power, and orbit these satellites resembled today’s
typical small satellites. They proved that satellite-linked TV was effective and
desirable, thus blazing the trail for the large geosynchronous communications
satellites in commercial and government service today. Several small Earth-
surveillance systems had flown by 1967. The first weather satellite, Tiros 1, flew in
1960. VELA was one of the most successful small, Earth-observing satellites. Built by
TRW for the Air Force and Department of Energy and weighing 152 kg, VELA sat-
ellites were the first to provide data from space concerning nuclear weapons testing on
Earth. Though initially flown as an experimental satellite and developed by a small
group in 18 months, VELA provided years of valuable reconnaissance service on
orbit.

Radio amateurs were quick to see how they could apply satellites to communication
and education. In 1961 the 5-kg OSCAR I (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur
Radio) was the first of a series of satellites radio amateurs built and operated world-
wide. Now numbering about 30 and spanning over 35 years, almost all of these
satellites have exceeded their operational design for on-orbit lifetime. The first com-
mercial comsat, Early Bird, which weighed just 39 kg, was flown in 1965.

Continuing Applications of Miniature Satellite Technology

Between 1965 and 1985, space-faring nations deemphasized small satellites in
favor of getting the most sophisticated performance from on-orbit resources. Because
the United States was committed to crewed flight, including the lunar landing, we
developed large boosters. Larger boosters also became available for placing large
payloads into geosynchronous orbit, revolutionizing global communications and
creating the infrastructure in place today.

As space systems rapidly grew in size, vigorous small satellite programs continued
but without much attention from either the public or mainstream aerospace engineer-
ing. For example, several amateur radio satellites were developed using technologies
and design approaches previously untried in spacecraft. They also continued to apply
simpler, less expensive devices which were rapidly vanishing as satellites became
larger and more complex. These small satellites employed photovoltaics to charge
NiCd batteries for on-orbit lifetimes of several years. They carried VHF, UHF, and
microwave transponders and had a range of operating modes controlled by ground
command.

Small satellites often played a role behind the scenes in developing military sys-
tems. Very small devices were routinely flown to provide on-orbit targets and signal
sources for tracking systems. These satellites usually carried active sensors which
sensed their RF and optical environment and relayed the data back to ground stations.

Many nations have entered the space community through launches of small satel-
lites, including Canada, France, Italy, England, Korea, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark,
UK, Israel, Spain, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Malaysia, Denmark, Japan, Germany,
Czechoslovakia, India, and The Netherlands.

Modern Low-Cost Systems

By 1985, amateur satellites such as OSCAR 10 and UoSat 2/OSCAR 11 had
demonstrated the value of reliable digital communications to smal] satellites. As Tel-
star clearly showed, we can use a single small satellite in low-Earth orbit only when
the ground station can see it; its ability to communicate was limited. To overcome this
problem, OSCAR 10 employed digital store and forward communications, using the
small satellite platform as a mailbox or bulletin board. Users anywhere on Earth could
transmit prepared messages to the satellite during its brief overhead pass. The satellite
could then deliver these messages throughout the world. Consequently, a single, small,
inexpensive satellite in low-Earth orbit provided global mail service—something not
even a large geosynchronous satellite can do.

This new operating mode began at the same time that NASA extended its Get Away
Special program to release small payloads into orbit. NASA’s program had provided
inexpensive transportation into space for small (< 68 kg), self-contained payloads.
Replacing ballast used to balance the Space Shuttle’s major payloads, the program had
carried payloads fixed to the payload bay wall on roundtrips to orbit. Goddard Space
Flight Center developed a Get Away Special container with an opening lid and a
spring ejection system. This allowed orbital insertion of a 68-kg satellite for less than
$50K. The European Ariane rocket had independently developed the ASAP (Ariane
Structure for Attached Payloads). Up to 6 small satellites could be carried aboard the
ASAP ring, each with mass up to 50 kg. Several Amsat and university satellites, as
well as spacecraft developed under national R&D programs for a range of applications
have since flown on ASAP. Due to the popularity and success of the ASAP program,
it has been expanded for Ariane V, accommodating physically larger payloads with a
mass of up to 100 kg. (For further details see London [1996]).

Thus, small, inexpensive satellites reentered the aerospace mainstream through the
confluence of three developments:

* Low-cost access to space

* Highly capable digital communications systems whose weight, power, and
volume were compatible with the Get Away Special

* Digital store and forward communications

Radio amateurs exploited the concept of a digital mailbox in a small, low-cost
satellite to communicate with relief workers in remote parts of the world. The same
technology was a fundamental feature of the University of Northern Utah’s NuSat,
which was designed to calibrate FAA air traffic control radars and to be an educational
tool] at the University. A similar application drove the Global Low Orbiting Message
Relay (GLOMR) satellite’s ability to carry data from remotely located sensors to a
central command post.

The success of these low-cost satellites caused designers to reassess the roles of
large and small space systems. Some payload organizations quickly recognized that
the ability to fly a simple, small payload with low cost and fast turnaround was ideally
suited to their needs. These first-generation users included scientific programs and
smaller national programs that could not justify the resources required to fly a con-
ventional technology project. Israel’s Offeq satellite, launched in October, 1988,
represents this facet of miniature technology. Today the small-satellite industry fo-
cuses on special niches, to satisfy missions that conventional satellite technology
cannot cover with large spacecraft and multiple payloads, developed in programs
spanning 5 to 15 years.

858 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.1

The ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-Ray Imaging Sensors) 120 kg satellite, built
in 1989 and launched in 1993, was representative of the increasing utility afforded by
small, low-cost satellites. The payload required anti-Sun orientation with a slow 2-rpm
roll about the Sun axis. This special stabilization requirement, plus the need for obser-
vation times of one month to one year, made this payload incompatible with larger
spacecraft catering to multiple payloads. The ALEXIS spacecraft bus, developed for
Los Alamos National Laboratory, weighs only 45 kg without its payload of scientific
instruments and costs about $3M. Yet it supplies 55 W of continuous power to the
payload, buffers 1 Gbit of science data between downlinks to a single ground station,
provides all spacecraft guidance and position data, and offers telemetry down and
uplinks at 750 and 9.6 kbit/s respectively. Built for a 6-month on-orbit mission
ALEXIS has provided over 6 years of on-orbit science operations and remains in con-
tinuous operation as of mid-1999.

Chemical Release Observation canister (CRO), another advanced miniature satel-
lite program, is a group of three small satellites, each carrying 25 kg of hydrazinic
chemicals. Designed to eject the liquid chemical for optical observation from the
ground and from the Shuttle, the satellites provide simple telemetry of the payload
state (temperature and pressure) and respond to various ground commands. The satel-
lites are aerodynamically stabilized to weathercock and fly oriented along their veloc-
ity vector. Built and flown for under $1M each, CRO was a highly successful
application of a minimum cost spacecraft.

Since the success of the OSCAR 10 satellite in 1983, miniature technology has
become an increasingly important element of hardware programs and systems archi-
tecture studies. OSCAR 10 provided analog and digital communications from a
Molniya orbit to amateur radio operators for about 14 years. Since 1965, OSCAR-
series satellites built by volunteer developers with limited budgets have demonstrated
part of the potential of miniature satellite technology.

Figure 22-1 addresses one reason these small systems have become so important.
The dramatic miniaturization of the electronic components composing most satellite
payloads implies that the spacecraft could do as much or more while becoming
smaller. But conventional satellites have increased their mass by three orders of mag-
nitude despite the mass of some components shrinking by as much as four orders of
magnitude. Miniature satellite devices built with advanced technology can do much
more than the very large, costly devices of only a decade ago.

Computers are another instance where miniaturizing has provided highly capable,
affordable machines. Miniaturizing has also changed the way we use these machines
and greatly expanded their applications. The computer revolution came about because
we thought of how to apply new technology in new ways. The technology is in place
to create a new class of small, inexpensive, and highly capable space systems. Our
challenge is to identify how to apply these new methods and products.

22.1 Designing Low-Cost Space Systems

Although we can design for low cost in different ways, some general rules apply
based on space-system development, launch, and operations costs. Launch costs are
often quoted simply as a linear function of mass on orbit for various orbit classes. This
simple model implies that achieving very low mass automatically minimizes launch
costs. But achieving low mass at low cost requires minimizing payload requirements,
redundancy, and size. By including the mission performance requirements as part of

Sputnik.

the design process, miniature technology tries to lower launch costs not by cost-saving
measures applied to complex satellites, but rather by minimizing the requirements
imposed on the spacecraft.

The single most significant factor driving ultimate mission costs will be the system
performance requirements. Unfortunately, these requirements are often determined
independently by the user organization before the design process begins. This practice
is encouraged by engineers who complain that they can’t design without specs to
design to! The small satellite system attempts to provide a valuable capability within
a severe set of volume, mass, power and complexity constraints. Only by tailoring
requirements to that which can be realistically fit into this limited resource envelope
can the small satellite design exercise come to a successful result. Typical tradeoffs
which should occur in the early phases of the design process include reduced data
storage and downlinking in favor of more onboard processing, reduced pointing and
stability requirements vs. more adaptive sensors and actuators, and reduced power by
careful design of payload instruments or reduction in duty cycle, leaving open the
possibility of a multiple satellite system which in combination can provide a higher
duty cycle and more frequent ground coverage.

Because launch resource is not a standard commodity, pricing in cost per unit mass
is misleading. Very small launch resources, including the Ariane ASAP, Space Shuttle
Hitchhiker and small payload space on most other major launch systems, often have a
single price per payload up to a maximum mass. Hitchhiker and ASAP payloads are
in general not mass but rather volume constrained. Thus, we need not spend payload
development resources on very lightweight structures, as well as the detailed analysis
and testing needed to design and verify them. The standard Hitchhiker carries 68 kg
for as little as $150,000. The resulting cost of $2,200 per kg is about 10% of standard
launch costs on a per unit mass basis. Maybe more significantly, the total cost is 0.1%
to 1% that of larger spacecraft.

We must keep in mind that these systems are secondary payloads—flown “‘stand-
by” and without a guaranteed launch date. If we build the payload to allow minimum

860 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.1

support at the launch site, integration into a range of launch vehicles, and maximum
flexibility in orbit requirements, we can minimize costs and program delays.

Dedicated small launch facilities, such as Pegasus or Shavit, price launch space per
flight rather than per unit mass. Thus, we cannot save money by reducing mass below
our allocation. In fact, because Pegasus and Shavit use solid propellant, they must
carry ballast if the payload mass is too low. As a result, we should avoid radical design
changes to shave mass, for these changes would require us to spend a lot of money
unnecessarily on materials, fabrication and analysis.

Reducing costs is often erroneously associated with increasing mission risk. Con-
ventional systems offer verifiable savings in expected cost of failure by lowering
failure probability for an expensive mission. But if the program budget exceeds our
available resources, we may have to abandon the program. This programmatic risk is
mitigated by choosing missions achievable with a minimum cost approach.

One way to save money in designs using miniature technology is to dispense with
full redundancy, thus risking a single-point failure. But net risk may in fact be lower
for a small nonredundant system. This is because redundancy requires selection and
switching mechanisms to arbitrate between elements. In miniature technology, we
choose to back up only critical systems with known low reliability. In a system of n
components each having a success (lack of failure) probability, R,, the overall reliabil-
ity of the system is

_ ph
R=R, (22-1)

Since the number of components, 7, nominally scales with mass, a minimum cost
small spacecraft may have n 1% as large as a larger spacecraft. Thus, the small system
can use parts with 99.99% reliability and achieve the same reliability as a large system
spending much more money to buy parts with 99.9999% reliability. Or, using the same
part quality the little spacecraft will be more reliable. Thus the reliability gained in a
larger system via redundancy is achieved in the smaller system through reduction in
the number of parts. In fact, parts failure is no longer the major cause of spacecraft fail-
ure. Rather it is human errors in design and operation, which are in part the result of
increased system complexity. Here too, a smaller, simpler system has a significant
reliability advantage.

In practice, miniature satellite systems have an excellent record of success. The
world production leader is AMSAT, the satellite organization for radio amateurs. Every
one of their over 30 satellites has been successful over 35 years of development
programs spanning many different development teams and missions. Their record
stems directly from miniature technology’s simplicity, its development process, and
its organizational elements, as discussed below. Single-string design is riskier as it
becomes more complex. The relatively simple design and subsystems in small satel-
lites make them more reliable.

Low-cost space vehicles must be smal] enough to be assembled by a unified group
with common goals. In a small design team, every member of the group has a direct
link to every other member. They negotiate interactively and communicate efficiently.
The team members take the minimum risk path to achieve the savings they mutually
seek. Large, segmented development organizations have trouble working in this close,
cooperative way.

The team designing a miniature satellite must consist of engineers with breadth and
depth. Each specialist needs to understand the requirements driving the overall design.

22.1 Designing Low-Cost Space Systems 861

A small team can produce unexpected innovations because each member can appreci-
ate the problems of other members. Teams suffer if they lose a key person. This vul-
nerability can be even higher in small teams because every team member is essential.
Managers of small programs need to ensure that each member works with a “buddy”
who, though the buddy may be focused on another aspect of the program, understands
to some extent what the engineer is doing. In the event of loss of that engineer from
the program, the buddy can take on his or her tasks and responsibilities while the team
redistributes work.

A small organization trades resources freely across disciplinary boundaries. No
team member takes any resource for granted or “owns” an allocation. The program
manager communicates concerns about cost throughout the group. The efficiency
possible in a small group is so valuable that the individuals often work much harder
rather than bring more communications and management burdens to the program. The
spacecraft team can carefully explore and negotiate every systems-level requirement
with the users in order to show them how to save money. Flexibility on both sides can
cut costs dramatically. A small program should plan to invest in automated design and
analysis tools. These tools reduce team labor hours, but more importantly they help to
get the job done without team size inflating beyond the size (about 20 people) which
allows close team interactions. Similarly the project should plan to subcontract
specialized functions to keep the team as small, focused and interactive as possible.

A Satellite program expends much of its resources on the ground station which may
operate two or three times longer than the satellite development program and require
expensive full-time staffing. To avoid the capital and maintenance costs for a large
ground station, it is best located at the user’s site—preferably in the user’s office.
Smal] satellites can be simple enough to be built around the user’s personal computer
and operated as a computer-controlled, laboratory apparatus.

Technologies employed in the ground station include computing systems from the
consumer market, such as a PC-based station controller, read-write optical disc
archiving, and commercial input-output cards. Because antenna costs increase rapidly
with gain, we engineer the link based on the best antenna gain achievable at low cost.
Sophisticated ground-station software eliminates most of the need for operator inter-
action and provides a simple, user-friendly interface requiring little special training.
The computer is the only interface to the ground-station equipment, so the user need
not understand any other equipment interfaces.

The program review used to develop conventional satellites is inappropriate for
miniature satellites. For conventional program reviews, one person represents each
department while other members keep working. But for the small satellite team, a
department” may be one person. Thus, for best efficiency, teleconferences and
smaller, less frequent Technical Interchange Meetings replace conventional reviews.
Usually, the members directly involved in a given issue meet; rarely does the whole
group need to attend.

Program costs depend on schedule about equally in large or small efforts. But
because miniature satellite programs are short, delaying a few months can increase
cost significantly with respect to the total development budget. Therefore program
managers must take the schedule seriously, always looking for means to finish and
launch the spacecraft as quickly as possible.

Like program management, quality assurance is a subfunction carried out within
the team developing a miniature satellite. No single individual or discrete organization
handles it. The team works case-by-case in deciding on fabrication standards, compo-

862 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.1

nent qualification, or requirements for derating and previous flight experience. The
same is true for applying specific fabrication standards or for inspections. This method
allows the system engineer to reduce or eliminate quality requirements if their cost
outweighs their contribution to the probability of success.

An example of selectively applying quality assurance standards is in the design of
a spacecraft mass memory, which contains single controller and input-output (I/O)
devices managing a large number of mass storage devices. Failure of one of the control
or I/O devices is catastrophic. Because there are few of these devices, we can justify
specifying highly reliable, highest-grade (and hence high cost) components. On the
other hand, failure of one or even several of the many memory components is not par-
ticularly serious. Further, procuring many of these devices at very high standards is
expensive. Thus, we procure memory for much less money at lower standards of qual-
ity and reliability.

Occasionally, a key component not previously used in spacecraft may improve per-
formance or save money. With lower reliability requirements and the flexibility to
consider parts individually, we can decide whether to apply the component, based on
the following:

¢ Whether its failure brings catastrophe or merely degrades operation
¢ How well we can simulate its space operation
¢ How much not using the component would cost in performance and resources

¢ Whether we can meet system reliability goals with it

Saving money in testing does not necessarily imply higher risk of on-orbit failure.
Here again the simplicity of miniature technology allows a different, more individual
approach. The program manager may opt to eliminate subsystem and component tests
in favor of a full system-level qualification. This decision does not reduce probability
of mission success. In fact, simulating the space environment achieved in testing may
be more accurate for the integrated system test approach because each part will be
qualified while operating with actual flight interfaces. The tradeoff is in program risk
vs. program cost. If many component or subsystem flaws exist, they are more easily
corrected at the subsystem test level. On the other hand, if few failures occur, we
should rely on the integrated system test, which eliminates long testing of subsystems
and components.

Miniature satellite testing should take advantage of the system’s simplicity. Wher-
ever possible, we should use the actual flight and ground hardware for all tests, thus
raising confidence that all system elements will actually work together in flight while
lowering investment in simulations, test fixtures, and facilities.

Every mission develops with overt or subtle political pressure to satisfy the widest
possible constituency. Conventional products typically carry a number of discrete,
often unrelated payloads supporting many users. But programs using miniature tech-
nology cannot bear the complex payloads or engineering and management interfaces
arising from this constituency building. To maintain the tight program staffing and
focus needed for close communication, we must control complexity. Further, unless
we limit spacecraft mass and volume, we may lose a launch niche. Increasing launch
costs pressure us to provide higher reliability through redundancy, formal program
controls, discrete quality assurance, and increased paperwork and subsystem testing.
Instead, we should usually split demanding payloads into separate programs rather
than lose the advantage of miniature satellite technology.

22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications 863

Earlier, we pointed out that trying to lighten structures beyond a practical minimum
mass made designs more complex without reducing launch costs. A conservative, sim-
ple design helps us avoid complexity in the miniature satellite program. The program
cannot support independent specialists analyzing various thermal, mechanical, stabil-
ity, and other properties. Designing conservatively eliminates detailed analysis, thus
maintaining the small development team and keeping the program within cost and
schedule.

We can also justify less analysis because the small spacecraft’s physical dimen-
sions support smaller thermal gradients. Simultaneously, their vibration-resonant
frequencies tend to be high whereas applied moments are low, owing to short unsup-
ported structure lengths. Wall thicknesses typically depend more on screw thread
depth requirements and machining tolerances. Thus, designs often include substantial
structural and heat transfer margins. Finite element modeling can then be eliminated
in favor of analyzing the overall system and a few critical parts. Therefore, we can save
time and resources and need not hire more people to develop, run and maintain com-
plex models and simulations.

22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications

22.2.1 Abilities of Small Space Systems

Smaller space vehicles can support only one or two features of the most capable
systems; larger systems dominate when we need many features. Thus, we will survey
what small spacecraft can do with the caveat that we must normally customize them
to each user’s requirements. Although we can probably increase a parameter’s perfor-
mance if an application depended on it, we usually gauge what is possible against what
has already been done or, at least, is in development.

Table 22-2 lists some of the common guidance and control techniques that have
special merit for small-satellite programs. Chapter 11 discusses satellite stabilization
in more detail. One option—no stabilization hardware at alli—is a simple and therefore
attractive alternative for small-satellite applications. To achieve downlink margin and
adequate power in any attitude, satellite antennas need to have spherical coverage and
solar cells must be distributed over the entire satellite surface. Many conventional sat-
ellites require gain antennas for two reasons. First, the satellite is in a high orbit and
hence distant from the ground station. Second, the telemetry rates required by multiple
on-orbit operations increase the load on the radio link. We do not need antenna gain
or stabilization to operate small satellites only a few hundred kilometers above the
Earth’s surface with a single, low-data-rate mission.

Passive stabilization, either aerodynamic, magnetic or gravity gradient, is often
used to minimize cost and complexity. Aerodynamically stabilized satellites are
simple but must be in very low orbit to be effective. Because orbital decay shortens the
mission life to less than one year, we should use it only in low-cost systems. Gravity
gradient torques can passively stabilize a satellite in an Earth-pointed orientation.
Small satellites have used this configuration for increased radio-link gain and imaging
of the Earth’s surface. Permanent magnets may also stabilize a small satellite by align-
ing it with the Earth’s magnetic field. This technique often combines with spin
maintenance schemes using solar radiation pressure. Completely passive and highly
reliable, the technique can also allow about 3 dB of link gain.

Because most small (and conventional) space vehicles are not oriented to the Sun,
and because articulating solar panels are costly and complex, little electrical power is
typically available in small satellites. But power has not typically constrained the
design of small, low-cost spacecraft because they:

¢ Incorporate power management as described below

¢ Experience only intermittent contact with the ground station during typical
LEO orbits

¢ Depend on the small satellite’s large ratio of surface area to volume—i.e.,
since power consumption scales with volume (mass) but solar power by sur-
face area, power requirements drop more quickly than the power available as
size scales downward.

Typical power management measures include:

¢ Using low-power devices such as complementary metal-oxide semiconductors
(CMOS) wherever possible

¢ Operating digital components at slow clock speeds to minimize power con-
sumption

¢ Duty cycling all components not requiring continuous power

* Considering directional ground station antennas to reduce transmitter power
requirements

Most power systems employ standard spacecraft solar panels and either NiCd or
lead-acid batteries. (UoSat E was the first small satellite to incorporate GaAs solar
panels as a means to increase available power in a miniature satellite.) Often, to control
cost, we fly commercial-grade commercial batteries in several parallel stacks. To reg-
ulate charge, we can use simple current control or more advanced, digitally controlled,
highly efficient circuits, depending on how much performance we must squeeze out of
a system. Much of the risk of employing new, innovative solutions is unexpected
effects elsewhere in a complex system. The simplicity of low-cost spacecraft lowers
the risk associated with innovation. Thus, they often are first to employ new technol-
ogies such as was the case with full-time digital charge control.

22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications 865

Power available in contemporary low-cost satellites ranges from a few watts in
unstabilized, Hitchhiker-sized spheres such as NuSat to over 60 W in Sun-stabilized
vehicles like ALEXIS. While scaling arguments favor small vehicles, the absolute
value of the steady-state power produced in LEO is typically small. Duty cycling
usually satisfies a payload’s need for more power. Where this is not possible, the
power requirements can drive up costs, because the satellite must provide more solar
panel area, and may need articulating solar panels when the spacecraft surface is not
large enough.

Small satellites have provided superior information processing at a very low price.
Small satellites with prices under $5 million are equipped with DSP and Pentium and
Power PC microprocessors. Using static RAM or very low drain DRAM, the satellite
can supply several Gbits of solid-state memory to buffer data between ground station
passes while consuming less than 5 W of power for all systems combined. Satellites
weighing under 20 kg have given us a full range of onboard signal processing: data
compression, error encoding, as well as data checking and decoding or encrypting and
deciphering algorithms.

Small, low-cost systems have flown with various telemetry and communications
systems, including VHF, UHF, and microwave links using FM and digital transmis-
sion ranging from 300 baud to 1 Mbaud. To obtain digital rates up to about 9,600 baud
duplex, we typically use nondirectional antennas on the ground and on the orbiting
platform as well as NBFM (Narrow Band FM). The short slant range to a satellite in
LEO has allowed us to develop ground units as small as a pocket calculator, which can
uplink and downlink digital messages. At the same time, directional dishes operating
at the S or X band can satisfy missions with requirements for very high data rates.
Maintaining low program cost depends in part on the designer’s ability to minimize
data rate and bandwidth, which drive costs on the ground and on the satellite. As the
data rate increases, we need more expensive components and new systems elements,
such as a steerable dish capable of the high angular rates of LEO satellites observed
from Earth.

As discussed in Sec. 22.1, launch costs do not change linearly with payload mass.
In smaller vehicles, the actual cost will depend on negotiations with other payloads
comprising the full launch payload, because even a very small payload is a significant
fraction of the total. On larger vehicles, flying as a secondary, space-available payload
may allow lower-than-standard pricing. Special launch services, such as the Shuttle,
Hitchhiker and Ariane ASAP programs, fix prices up to a maximum allowable carrier
capacity. To spend less money overall, we need to survey existing launch resources
and build to match the largest number of candidate vehicles. In this way, we can geta
quick, cost-efficient ride on the first launcher with available space.

Higher prices per kg are associated with small vehicles such as Pegasus and Shavit
because economies of scale favor larger launch vehicles. However, because a small
payload may occupy all or at least a major part of a small vehicle, the small payload
operator has more control over launch schedule and final orbit than when purchasing
secondary space on a larger rocket. Secondary payload accommodations being offered
by the Hitchhiker and ASAP programs are priced mainly to cover basic administrative
costs. The Space Shuttle programs offer an unusual value if we can live with the safety,
mass, and orbit limitations of that program. Ariane and Delta offer adapters to carry
many small payloads, and Ariane has launched several AMSAT satellites. These
vehicles have well-established launch records and pricing structures well below small,
dedicated launch vehicles. Both Ariane and Delta offer launches for commercial
payloads.

866 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.2

22.2.2 Emerging Miniature and Low-Cost Technologies

Small satellites depend heavily on increased ability to compute and store data using
low power. An 8.5-kg microsat’s capability today was unavailable in the 1/2-ton sat-
ellites of 15 years ago. Digital communications and large data buffers ushered in the
store and forward operating mode, which dovetailed with the communications archi-
tecture natural to LEO satellites. Advances in these same areas may further benefit
small satellites, but our fear of risk slows applications of new technology to space.
Particularly, concerns over the effects of radiation on integrated circuits in the space
environment have retarded the transfer of digital technologies to miniature satellite
devices. This partly explains why, as terrestrial machines transitioned to Pentium and
Power PC microprocessors, the first 8086 derivative was not used in orbit until the
1990s. Thus, we have plenty of room to apply advances in integrated-circuit technol-
ogy to miniature devices.

Whatever progress is made in data manipulation and storage devices, many payload
devices will still have intrinsic power requirements which are hard to reduce. These
include radio transmitters, optical beacons, active coolers, and guidance and control
hardware such as magnetic torque coils and momentum wheels. Better conversion of
solar to electrical power will enable advances in miniature technology devices now
relying mainly on silicon-based photovoltaics and NiCd batteries. GaAs photovoltaics
are becoming common on small spacecraft with even more efficient cells now appear-
ing on the horizon. The major effect of improvements in technologies for photovoltaic
and energy storage will be to increase the scope of orbital functions which miniature
satellite devices can perform.

Often up to 20% of spacecraft mass is batteries. Lithium ion secondary batteries are
now transitioning into microsatellites to reduce mass and improve performance.
Momentum wheels are now scaling down in size, mass, power and cost to accommo-
date smaller satellites.

Advances in focal plane technology already allow very small satellites to carry
digital imaging over a range of detector wavelengths. Sensitive, dense focal planes can
enable high-resolution imaging with reduced objective lens diameter and poorer
pointing stability. Advanced techniques for compressing image data, as well as
increasing density of digital memory, will ease the burden of acquiring and storing
image data for later transmission to Earth. Commercial organizations and countries
now recognize that a low-cost satellite can perform meaningful imaging. This has
spawned the startup of new commercial imaging companies serving specific market
niches, as well as numerous new government-sponsored remote sensing satellite
projects.

As we continue to reduce electronics size, the aperture requirements will increas-
ingly determine satellite size, mass, and, ultimately, cost. Particularly, high gain
antennas, very fast, high resolution optics, and solar power collection, require large
apertures. Thus, a key technology will be development of low mass/low cost deploy-
able optics, solar arrays and antennas.

A satellite on orbit is a type of robot. It is a device which carries out various phys-
ical activities under control of an autonomous, synthetic controller. As terrestrial
robotic devices become more capable, it is logical that satellites will become more
capable and more autonomous. This would enable new applications involving
extended periods of autonomy (perhaps for missions outside of the Earth-Moon sys-
tem), intelligent interactions with other space and terrestrial objects, and coordination
of the behavior of large numbers of small satellites.

22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications 867

While the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Air Force, and NASA
try to develop a new generation of launch vehicles for small payloads, no launch tech-
nology breakthroughs appear to be on the horizon. Organizations are working very
hard to create marginal savings in launch costs, and conventional, large vehicles
remain the most cost-efficient way to inject a satellite into orbit. We expect no major
advances in launch technology in the next decade.

Until a few years ago, advanced designs for spacecraft architecture focused almost
completely on conventional technology devices. The recent attention paid to systems
composed of smaller, less costly components on-orbit is likely to produce new
applications better suited to them, such as missions requiring a network of detectors
distributed in orbit around the Earth or Sun. Previously, such concepts were dismissed
because building and launching many conventional satellites into different, highly
energetic orbits are expensive. Reducing launch mass by an order of magnitude or
more may make these missions economically feasible.

In general, anticipated technological advances in information processing, solid
State detectors, autonomous intelligence and power conversion will all increase appli-
cations of miniature technology. As we discover new systems architectures and
develop new applications for satellite systems, miniature technology will take on
heightened importance in future space programs.

22.2.3 Potential Applications

An array of satellites in random, low-Earth orbits can provide fully connected,
continuous communications, as Fig. 22-2 shows. This fact has spawned numerous
satellite programs which divide into the Big and Little LEOs. Big LEOs offer real-time
connectivity, mainly for telephone but ultimately for very high bandwidth
applications. Little LEOs are one- and two-way digital message carriers, used for asset
tracking, monitoring and paging. All of the systems currently contemplated are con-
stellations, meaning the spacecraft maintain constant position relative to each other.
The number of satellites in the constellation ranges from 5 or 6 in the case of some
Little LEOs servicing limited areas or with long latency—the time between passes
over a user location. Big LEOs with constellations of 24 to over 240 satellites are in
development. In general, larger numbers of satellites can provide higher bandwidth.
Some of the systems use inter-satellite links to forward signals beyond their own foot-
print. Others immediately relay communication from the user to a ground station
which feeds the data via the terrestrial network.

Unlike the constellations, satellite clusters consist of large numbers of satellite
randomly distributed in their orbit planes without propulsion to maintain fixed relative
to positions. These satellites are smaller and simpler than those in the constellations.
They can be fit into available space on virtually any LEO launch. In time, such a net-
work would become fully populated. Computer modeling of clusters shows that 400
satellites in random orbits provide 95% global coverage and 100% coverage from
other orbiting platforms. Thus, the satellite cluster could support both point-to-point
ground communications and satellite-to-ground links. One significant feature of satel-
lite arrays, either constellation or clusters, to worldwide communications from the mil-
itary viewpoint is its intrinsic survivability. Destruction of 1 or even 20 of the cluster’s
members barely affects the network’s overall effectiveness. Presumably the small,
simple, mass-produced satellites of the cluster would be less expensive than the weap-
on required to destroy them. Their small size would make them intrinsically difficult

provide point-to-point global communication.

to track and would also permit fabrication from materials transparent to radar. Their
intrinsic redundancy and graceful degradation justify applying inexpensive, single-
string design and fabrication techniques which will further reduce cost.

Another application of small satellites is for low-cost imaging. These systems use
advanced focal-plane technologies to obtain fine optical resolution with relatively sim-
ple guidance systems. By using multiple satellites in clusters or constellations,
frequent image updates can be combined with good ground resolution. Smaller, low-
cost satellite can be optimized to specific applications such as agriculture, coastal zone
management or land use and taxation. Several businesses and countries are developing
systems that will eventually eliminate the monopoly of a few large government-owned
systems on optical space surveillance of Earth-bound activities.

AMSAT and several commercial and government organizations are developing or
using small satellites in geosynchronous orbits. AMSAT plans to supplement existing
global digital communications from LEO satellites with real-time digital and analog
communications. Indostar is the first of a new generation of geosynchronous satellites
supporting only a few transponders. These small geosynchronous comsats could serve
as on-orbit spares. Moreover, they appeal to smaller corporate and national users
which cannot themselves support a conventional GEO comsat. These users must now
either lease individual channels of a large satellite or become a member of a conglom-
erate such as Intelsat. Using miniature satellite devices with lower capability and price,
smaller users can own and hence control the entire space asset, increasing their auton-
omy and security. Though GEO launch costs traditionally are high, small satellites can
hold down those costs by piggy-backing on a GEO neighbor’s launch, if available.
However, few small satellites can take advantage of the GEO orbit.

Measurements of rapidly varying fields over astronomically significant baselines is
impossible with a single satellite. By the time the satellite flies across the region of
interest, temporal variations in the field distort the map. By flying tens to hundreds of
very small satellites in varying trajectories, we can observe such phenomena as the
charged-particle environments and magnetic-field variations of the Earth and Sun.

22.3 Applying Miniature Satellite Technology to FireSat 869

Particularly for solar observations, the desired trajectory energy is quite high, so we
need low satellite mass. Small satellites are ideally suited for this class of
mission—requiring many spacecraft inserted into energetic trajectories. Due to the
scientific nature and high launch costs of such missions, they are best suited for NASA
and other national science and research organizations.

22.3 Applying Miniature Satellite Technology to FireSat

To show how the small satellite conceptual process works, we will look at the
application of miniature technology to the FireSat problem of detecting and monitor-
ing forest fires either nationally or worldwide. This system is challenged to provide
rapidly updated data on a firefront’s genesis, topology and local progress to the Forest
Service’s central office. A network of low-flying reconnaissance spacecraft could
resolve the firefront to a few meters through multispectral imagers. Then the satellite
could find the spread rate by staring at the front during a pass and applying image
processing techniques to the downlinked data. Direct broadcast to the field through a
geosynchronous comsat would forward the derived data to the firefighting teams. Such
a system would be highly complex and costly. We believe that this system does not
exist because conventional satellite technology cannot meet the user’s recognized
requirements at an affordable price.

Serious forest and brush fires often begin with a simple match or a spark that is hard
to see from an orbiting platform. One potential solution is to fly very low-resolution
imagers filtered to the near IR. Data on nascent fires would be downlinked to a simple
ground station which could reconstruct the low-resolution images and compare them
with ground truth, such as the locations of large cities and other bright areas. The low
resolution and subsequent low bandwidth will allow use of PC-based ground stations
like those already built for earlier small imaging satellites. This solution parallels the
conventional technology approach, but with minimum capability.

A more innovative solution would deploy simple thermocouple sensors from air-
craft, with small nets to catch them in treetops, where forest fires spread. Fitted with a
lithium primary battery and a 1-W uplink transmitter, the sensor could simply turn on
(much like an Emergency Locator Transmitter) when its temperature reaches, say,
80 °C, broadcasting its digitally encoded serial number to a simple small satellite for
digital messaging.

After discovering a forest fire, monitors would dispatch an aircraft to the firefront
to drop a denser network of more sophisticated sensors. These sensors could transmit
the local temperature and their own ID number to the aircraft, which would maintain
a map of the sensor locations by recording them as each sensor is dropped. As the sat-
ellite overflew, it would receive the signals of the upgraded sensors, causing it to
rebroadcast a map of sensor ID numbers and temperatures to the local firefighting
crew. Their ground station would receive a map of sensor ID numbers and locations,
so they could immediately derive a temperature contour map. Figure 22-3 shows the
complete system.

A simple treetop sensor would be inexpensive because it consists of only a beacon,
a battery and a thermocouple. Dispersing the sensors could occur during routine
transportation and patrol flights because the sensors are merely scattered. The satel-
lites serving this application would be very small, simple devices, which any sort of
launch vehicle could launch. All firefighting crews would need small, portable ground
stations, and the aircraft deploying sensors would use GPS to record location when

dropping each high-resolution sensor. A laptop computer would allow an operator to

enter data as the sensors drop. The ground control stations consist of little more than

the field units, a small computer, transmitter, receiver and ornnidirectional antenna.
The system described above would provide the following:

* Global monitoring of new forest fires from a few ground stations located any-
where on Earth

* Ability to locate firefronts to treetop resolution after identifying a fightable
blaze

¢« Communication of the fire progress directly to the field commander

With this approach, we benefit from minimal on-orbit requirements, cheap replace-
ment, and built-in redundancy. With several satellites on orbit, if one fails, the system
degrades only slightly. Any launch to LEO can potentially rebuild the system. Suppli-
ers of miniature satellites can put needed spacecraft on orbit in under a year, and the
system could be operating 18 months after contract go-ahead.

Note that in this example miniature satellite technology is considered a systems
architecture discipline. This designation is accurate and intentional. Miniature tech-
nology is not a special set of technologies used for building conventional capabilities
into small, cheap boxes. It is a new way of looking at an application to develop a
solution which doesn’t require conventional technology and which a closely-knit team
of under 20 satellite engineers can handle. Using miniature technology architecture, a

22.4 Scaling from Large to Small Systems 871

spacecraft needs only modest capabilities to detect and monitor forest fires. The satel-
lites need only listen for beacons and crudely locate them to within a few kilometers
or tens of kilometers. In the second mode of operation, at the firefront, the uplinked
data from even a few thousand beacons is much less than 1 Mbit.

The 13-cm Microsat cube developed and flown successfully by AMSAT North
America and shown in Fig. 22-4 is an example of the type of miniature technology
device which can meet all of the satellite requirements for the FireSat mission. The
microsats weigh only 8.5 kg and are fitted typically with 8 Mbits of RAM. The unsta-
bilized satellites carry omnidirectional antennas providing sufficient link to recognize
a low-bandwidth, 0.5-W beacon at the Earth’s horizon from 800-km orbit.

Fig. 22-4. MicroSat Cube Developed by AMSAT North America. This 13-cm, 8.5-kg satellite
first flown in 1990 could meet the space segment requirements for the FireSat concept
shown in Fig. 22-3.

Even in small quantities these satellites can be produced for less than $400,000,
because they are so simple. By using several satellites, the system itself is redundant,
so each satellite can be simpler, less reliable, and of a single-string design. Lower
reliability requirements allow us to procure commercial-grade components without
special ordering, testing or quality assurance. With this method, we can buy parts
cheaper and design more efficiently by using more modern, capable components. We
can also cut engineering time spent finding qualified parts and working with vendors
to meet program specifications.

Simple mission requirements allow the satellites to be quite small, thus greatly
reducing launch and ground-support costs. In fact, we can transport them to a test or
launch site by commercial airliner as carry-on luggage.

22.4 Scaling from Large to Small Systems

The fact that miniature technology devices tend to be physically small means that
physical scaling laws will account for some fundamental differences between minia-
ture and conventional satellite devices. A conventional device can also be physically

872 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.4

small; this section addresses only the engineering differences which become signifi-
cant when we develop a very small spacecraft.

As illustrated in Fig. 22-5, scaling up a simple cylindrical satellite by factor 5 in
linear dimension increases its projected area by 25 and its volume by 125. If we
assume that mass and power consumption are roughly proportional to the volume of
electronics, this simple geometric scaling has implications for the systems designer.
As satellite size decreases, its power requirement decreases faster than its projected
area. So smaller satellites typically do not need deployable solar panels.

the mass, and /is the moment of inertia.

As we have mentioned, physically short thermal and load paths characteristic of
smaller satellites usually allow less critical thermal and structural design. The small
satellite of linear dimension 1 has to conduct 1 unit of heat flux over a maximum
distance 0.5. The larger satellite must conduct 125 units of heat flux over a maximum
distance of 2.5, requiring roughly 125 times more temperature difference between the
satellite surface and interior. Presumably, thicker structural members in the larger
satellite partly offset this difference, but satellite thermal considerations rarely affect
structural design very much. Similarly, supporting the satellite from its edges (for
example) results in much thicker structure relative to size for a large satellite than for
a small one. This advantage to small size diminishes somewhat because wall thick-
nesses in very small devices often depend on machining and handling limits. Thus, we
cannot build the small satellite to theoretical structural limits, so it tends to be heavier
and a better heat conductor than it would be if designed optimally for strength.

The thermal and structural oversizing typical of small satellites tends to affect
programs positively and negatively. Miniature technology devices tend to be built to
exceed specifications, so they require very little analytical effort to ensure their struc-
tural and thermal integrity compared with conventional technology devices. Also they
rarely require special, costly thermal and structural materials and devices such as high
strength alloys, composites, or heat pipes.

On the other hand, miniature technology devices support the operational payload
on orbit less efficiently because of design expediency and difficulty in manufacturing
very thin, light, small structures. As Fig. 22-6 illustrates, OSCAR 13, a miniature tech-
nology comsat, has much more of its mass devoted to support functions such as

22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems 873

structure, guidance, and propulsion than the geosynchronous comsat, Palapa B, which
uses conventional technology. Only 21.5% of OSCAR 13’s weight carries payload
electronics compared with 34.5% of Palapa B’s. We cannot precisely compare large
and small satellites because their missions and operating conditions are so different.
But Fig. 22-6 shows that the key to miniature systems is not a new technology or trick
which allows its practitioners a special advantage over conventional systems. It is a
systems discipline which allows its engineers to meet a user requirement cheaply and
quickly despite its inherent disabilities.

22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems

To survive as an industry, low-cost space systems must be more cost effective than
space- and ground-based alternatives. To confirm savings, we must verify that we can
complete and fly hardware successfully at low cost. The value to the user must be at
least as large in proportion to cost (including accounting for risk) as competing alter-
natives, such as conventional technology.

Experience in some of the more recent smal] satellites illustrates the range of costs
which can be expected in a smal] satellite program. Table 22-3 lists approximate pro-
gram costs for-some small satellites (in 1990 dollars).

We can easily survey small-satellite programs and demonstrate their low cost
compared with conventional satellites. Understanding the basis for this cost difference
is more complex. The cost pyramid in Fig. 22-7 is one way of explaining the dramatic
difference between miniature and conventional costs for a small, astronomical satellite
proposed as a university research program to NASA. The pyramid tracks cost growth
in translating a hypothetical miniature satellite program to a conventional program
with similar operational specifications. The pyramid topology is apt because each
extra cost adds to the previous cost. Thus the cost growth is more geometric than arith-
metic.

Starting with an initial satellite cost of $2M, we would establish a dialogue with the
scientific user group to try to reduce program cost while maintaining the scientific
value of the mission. This vertically integrated process leads us to modify operations
by relaxing the pointing accuracy, thus saving considerable money at the second stra-
tum of the pyramid.

Fig. 22-7. Conventional Satellites Impose Significant Costs over a Low-Cost, Small Satel-
lite Program. In this example based on design studies of a small astronomical
satellite, the development cost is $2M compared with ~$18M for a conventional
satellite for the same mission. Additional costs for test, ground station, and on-orbit
operations will further widen the cost gap between the two approaches.

In this case, the user group had a fixed budget ceiling. Thus, as is often true in
miniature satellites, the reliability trade off reduces to a choice between controlling
cost (at increased risk) and cancelling the program. The choice to accept industrial-
grade components saved ~$1.5M compared to space grade. Because small satellites
have 10% to 1% as many parts as larger spacecraft, part failure is less significant to
achieving mission reliability. Thus, small satellites routinely employ less expensive,
more modern and more readily available commercial parts saving money via parts
cost, shortened schedule and simplified design. In some cases, contractors cannot eas-
ily purchase individual space-grade parts, so they must buy parts in lots and test them,
or use a more poorly suited component. Both of these options—in-house qualification
or redesign around poorly suited components—cost much more money.

Component traceability strongly drives up costs, because it requires a program
infrastructure, thus driving up direct and overhead costs. Direct costs increase partly
because subcontractors must attend to traceability, thus increasing the cost of supplied
components and assemblies. Traceability, like space-class specification, eliminates
many potential components, because mass-produced devices not already made to
space-class are not traceable. Industrial grade NiCd batteries are typical of this
dilemma. Only MIL grade and above—ten times more expensive—are traceable.

Extensive periodic program reviews are of questionable value at all project scales.
But a small team working on a miniature satellite project can save a lot of money by
substituting regular communications for formal reviews. Of course, we can keep the
team size down if we can avoid those earlier requirements, such as higher pointing
accuracy, S-class parts, and traceability. A program review for any sized program has
direct and hidden costs such as travel, time spent in meetings, preparation time, and
misdirection of the hardware team towards generating paper rather than making hard-
ware. But the penalty is more significant for a small program. Budget is often severely
constrained such that airline tickets and hotel costs are significant. But more impor-
tantly, efficiency of small spacecraft development is in part rooted in the small size of
the team. Additional burdens including numerous reviews and part tracking can
inflate team size beyond that allowing very rapid, informal interactions or that
encourage optimal resource allocations.

876 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5

Although the exact numbers in the cost pyramid are all estimates derived from a
study of system architecture, present experience with miniature and conventional pro-
grams and contractors supports them. The interest in missions using miniature
satellites directly relates to this cost difference.

The above arguments notwithstanding, we still must show that particular missions
can be performed more cost effectively with miniature technology than with conven-
tional technology. Clearly, to achieve cost and schedule benefits, users of miniature
technology must sacrifice some performance but also realize important gains in sched-
ule. We cannot compare conventional and miniature products purely with numbers,
because they differ qualitatively. But the following example illustrates how miniature
technology can save money and increase reliability of an overall system.

A 50-kg satellite can be launched piggyback for between $50,000 and $1M,
depending on the launcher. The Pegasus launcher has enough payload to launch about
10 satellites of 50 kg each for $1.5M each. When we have invested little in the launch,
we can tolerate a less reliable satellite. A 90%-reliable satellite built for $1M plus a
$1M launch investment (on-orbit cost of $2M) has an expected cost to 100% reliability
of

$2M + 0.90 = $2.22M

That is, to get 9 satellites working on orbit, we will need to build and launch 10, so
the effective cost per satellite increases incrementally. As mentioned earlier, engi-
neering to increase reliability in a single satellite costs a lot of money. Numerous
subsystem assemblies and more complex control systems drive up these costs. The
most reliable components can cost many times more than their commercial counter-
parts. A 28V stack of space-qualified NiCd batteries with 40 W-hr total charge costs
about $40,000 and weighs 10 kg. The best commercial technology available from the
same supplier costs $180 and weighs 4 kg. At $20,000/kg launch cost, the total savings
is $159,820. Thus, the cost ratio between high and moderate reliability systems is 3:1.

Of course, we should not use small satellites when we cannot reduce the payload’s
size, mass, or support; the satellite will require a large fixed investment and a costly
launch. For example, if the FireSat needs an imaging system with an optical objective
of 1-m diameter, fitted to a steerable platform with arc-minute accuracy and stability,
present technology would make the system’s mass well over a ton. Launch costs will
be near $40M, and payload costs could be equally large. With $100M invested in the
system, the value of increasing reliability from 90% to 95% is $5.9M. Thus, adding
redundant systems to roughly double reliability can be quantitatively justified if they
increase costs less than this amount. Miniature technology is not appropriate for such
a large mission, regardless of reliability. For one thing, a group of people each charged
with understanding most of the total system could not fabricate such a large system.
The more bureaucratic approaches of conventional technology will work better in this
case.

We also cannot accurately measure the cost of failure simply by quoting orbit-
system cost (satellite plus launch vehicle). Some payloads are worth more than their
dollar price, the prime example being crewed vehicles. The value to society of preserv-
ing life is very high, particularly in a public government activity during peace time.
Also, even if we accurately measure the space component’s cost, we can still under-
estimate the real cost of a failure. Many missions require coordination with other
valuable assets. Deploying and reconfiguring of space and ground assets for a space
test can require more financial commitment than the space vehicle itself. Lost oppor-

22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems 877

tunities are also quite costly. If a single, large surveillance satellite fails on orbit, we
may not secure continuous observation, thus losing politically vital data that is more
valuable than the on-orbit asset.

Ultimately, we must associate a cost with on-orbit failure, assessing several levels
of reliability in terms of program cost, complexity, and schedule. We can then decide
whether to build to reliability requirements. In comparing a spectrum of candidates,
we must remember that cost and reliability may not relate directly. A much smaller,
simpler spacecraft, built by a very small group whose members are familiar with the
whole system can be more reliable than a much more complex solution despite the
latter’s more reliable parts and redundancies.

Other non-economic factors also play a role in selecting conventional over minia-
ture technology. Risks in program management often deter designers from applying
miniature technology. The person who must deploy a one-of-a-kind space vehicle may
know that the final price will be unimportant so long as the mission is a success. Or
conversely, he or she understands that a failure, no matter how cheaply executed, is
still a failure. Wise program managers use miniature satellite methods for small, rela-
tively simple applications, not for highly complex missions relying upon large teams.
Launch of many satellites also better follows probability distributions.

We should not, however, overestimate the importance of single string design to the
cost advantages of small satellites. In fact, many small satellites have incorporated
highly redundant architectures. ALEXIS includes a highly redundant digital system, a
power system which is quadruply redundant and 3 parallel payload systems. DSI’s
MacSats were virtually fully redundant.

Also important is the application of low-cost approaches to subsystems. The exam-
ple mentioned above of substituting commercial NiCd batteries for space-qualified
ones can save up to $1M in the cost of a 200-kg small satellite. ALEXIS carries two
custom Sun sensors built by AeroAstro, each for about 10% of the cost of existing
space qualified units. Because they use less power, and are smaller and lighter than
Sun sensors designed for larger satellites with more demanding performance and qual-
ity specifications, their cost savings ripple through the entire spacecraft bus design.
The net savings in using simpler Sun sensors is estimated in the case of ALEXIS to
have been several hundred thousand dollars.

Because the torques required to stabilize a small satellite are small, use of costly
iron core torque coils is often not necessary. Instead, much simpler and lower cost air
core coils can be used. Typically this can result in $50,000 in savings for a small
satellite. When the design is correctly accomplished, a small satellite is not structure-
limited. In fact, Martin Sweeting of Surrey Satellites has said that the difference
between large and small satellites is whether a distinct structure is required. This is
because small satellite characteristic lengths are short, and structure is usually over-
built due to manufacturing constraints (metal needs to be thick enough to support
fasteners and thereby becomes thicker than necessary for purely structural consider-
ations) or because the mass savings of a weight reduction program aren’t significant.
In any case, there is a savings both in that higher cost materials, including composites,
are generally not used, and little structural analysis is required.

Very significant cost savings are realized by specification of commercial, instead
of military or space, grade components. Savings result from several benefits. Of course
Mil-B and S-class parts are quite costly—sometimes 10 to 100 times more than the
equivalent commercial part lacking the qualification inspections and paperwork. They
are rarely available in small numbers, since they are built and tested in separate

878 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5

production runs. One integrated circuit, available for $50 commercially, may cost
$500 in S-class, but may only be available in lots of 20—increasing the purchase cost
to $10,000. Perhaps more importantly, the most modern technologies are seldom
available in higher grade components, forcing a compromise to inelegant design solu-
tions. The HETE spacecraft, built to commercial specifications, takes advantage of
several modern, radiation-hard, semi-custom, integrated circuit components which
eliminate hundreds of S-class integrated circuits from the parts count. Besides reduc-
ing parts costs by tens of thousands of dollars, the modern technology reduces the
number of circuit boards, greatly reduces design, development and test labor, and
requires much less power. The savings in spacecraft resources of power, space and
mass, combined with the parts and labor cost savings, make the implementation of this
commercial technology worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings to the $4M
spacecraft budget.

Some components cannot be significantly altered for use on small satellites, com-
pared with conventional designs. As an example, spacecraft photovoltaics (solar
panels) have no market except spacecraft. In these cases, we try to work with tradition-
al vendors to find ways to decrease costs. Paralleling the spacecraft design approach,
these may include using flight spares developed for other programs, reducing non-
hardware deliverables (meetings and paper) and interactive design to produce a design
specification which is intrinsically inexpensive to build and test. Israeli Aircraft Indus-
tries’ MLM division has succeeded in producing spacecraft photovoltaics at less than
half the cost per installed watt of conventional spacecraft photovoltaic systems, with-
out any decrease in product quality or performance through application of these steps.

Formal engineering guidelines institutionalize conventional satellite technology.
The manager of a hardware development program that fails will not have to account
for the failure if he or she documents the program thoroughly and builds the system to
military specifications and Department of Defense guidelines. But program managers
using miniature technology employ untried components when it is cost-effective and
they perceive little risk. Yet, if their programs fail, they are accountable.

Thus far we have concentrated on two important motivators for application of small
satellites—cost and unique capabilities. But small satellites, owing to their simpler
architecture, the smaller team required for their development, and the smaller amounts
of money required, can be built on very rapid schedules. AMSAT, motivated by the
availability of a near-term launch slot, produced and flew a small satellite in 9 months.
With typical development time as short as 18 months, the spacecraft development
schedule is usually dominated more by the bureaucratic delays in getting a program
started, than by the time to engineer, build, test, modify, retest and deploy a small
satellite.

Figure 22-8 shows that besides the quantitative shortening of the development
schedule, small satellite development is a highly interactive process. Activity begins
when a particular mission is identified—in the case of Firesat this could be the mission
to detect forest fires. In discussions between the user community and the development
group in the ensuing 30 days, several very low resolution sketches of possible satellite
configurations can be developed, each tailored to different launch vehicles, different
size, mass, cost constraints, and different performance levels. This helps users to
understand the impact of their budget on the ultimate capabilities they can achieve. If
there is no way to get something of value for the user within the user budget, the pro-
gram needs to be reconsidered and certainly there shouldn’t be additional resource
expended on detailed design until at least a tangency between the cost and utility
curves is achieved.

With a rough-order-of-magnitude budget in mind, planners can create a strategy of
spacecraft size, launch vehicle and capability range. This loose set of guidelines then
forms the basis for a conceptual-level, engineering trade study. This activity is gener-
ally carried out over a month or so with a team of 1, or at maximum 2, systems
engineers with help from various subsystems specialists on an as-needed basis. The
systems engineer should communicate frequently, no less often than weekly, with the
user organization representative to review progress—particularly to discuss ways in
which relaxations of requirements can reduce cost and to explore newly uncovered
opportunities to provide additional capability without seriously impacting system
complexity.

Only after the systems engineer and the user representative have explored this
envelope of architectural options and the capabilities envelopes, do we draft a final
requirements document drafted. This is important. We do not achieve the lowest pos-
sible satellite size and mission cost by a priori assignment of requirements to the
satellite design. Just one especially difficult requirement, possibly not vital to the over-
all mission, can result in a costly and unwieldy design. Requirements and capabilities
should be freely traded to reach a more global optimization of cost and complexity
minimization coupled with achieving the best systems performance.

Equipped with an interactively defined set of specifications and detailed sketches
of the spacecraft layout, along with weight and power budget estimates, the pre-
liminary design process gets underway. Even at this very early stage, there will be
components which everyone knows will be needed. These might include an oversup-
ply of NiCd batteries for later selection or the photovoltaic cells necessary to build up
solar panels. Also, bids can be solicited for guidance sensors and actuators based on
estimated requirements. Also put on order any parts needed for building test fixtures

880 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5

or circuits. Even in a small, inexpensive satellite program, the value of beginning the
hardware flow is high and the cost of parts ordered which end up unused is
small—usually it is nearly zero. By ordering that which can be ordered as soon as it is
identified, we spread the parts procurement process more evenly over the program
lifetime. If certain components are unavailable or won’t work in the proposed appli-
cation, it’s important to discover the problem as soon in the design and development
process as possible.

We allocate the entire preliminary and detailed design process about 7 months.
Fabrication formally begins, though by the Critical Design Review there should be a
lot of working hardware already in house. This will give substance to the CDR and
also allows the remaining fabrication of subsystems to be completed in an additional
4 months.

Six full months are allocated for integration and test. To have confidence in a
system built with commercial components and possibly lacking full redundancy, test
is extremely important and there is no substitute for uninterrupted time using the hard-
ware in various modes—thermal vacuum, as well as desktop routine operation.

Launch readiness is the last opportunity to resolve issues which have come up in
the development process. There will always be things which the team wishes would
have happened or not happened. The flight readiness review team must be made aware
of these concerns and must be ready to delay the launch if it determines some deficien-
cies are not acceptable. Ideally the launch will take place immediately after the review
to minimize the temptation to “improve” the spacecraft.

A note on program delays may help. Interruptions in any program are always much
more destructive of cost and schedule than managers appreciate. In a small program
even more than a large one, the documentation is at a minimum and the focus of the
small team creates efficiency. To withstand frequent delays and the start-stop-restart
mode of many government-funded programs, a bureaucratic system is needed to doc-
ument work and communicate progress as new individuals are assigned to roles. This
will ultimately result in the small program taking on some characteristics of conven-
tional, large programs with associated lengthening of the schedule, cost growth and
increased difficulty in meeting requirements, particularly staying within the launch
vehicle constraints.

In summary, how do we know when to procure a miniature technology system? The
following questions will guide our decision:

1. Will miniature satellite technology enable flying a mission which will other-
wise be shelved?

2. Can some give and take be allowed between requirements and capabilities?
3. Is reliability achieved through simplicity?
4. Can the flight hardware fly on a space-available basis?

a: Is the flight hardware buildable at < 400 kg?

b: Is there no special window required for orbit insertion?

5. Can the program management organization deviate from Mil-Specs and other
norms of conventional satellite development?

6. Can hardware and software be built by < 20 people?

7. Is there a significant benefit in a rapid schedule?

22.6 Annotated Bibliography on Low-Cost Space Systems 881

8. Are many small systems preferred over a few large ones?
9. Do you want the user group to operate the ground facility?

10. Is the mission lifetime goal less than 5 years?

We mentioned earlier that ground operations can significantly affect overall
program cost. Often, the satellite’s orbital lifetime is longer than its development
period, and staffing of a major ground station can be larger than that of a development
program for a miniature spacecraft. Miniature technology reduces ground-station costs
through its systems architecture and the ground station’s design.

A low-cost satellite program cannot afford the luxury of ground stations staffed by
a separate operations group. Also, we may not be able to operate costly remote ground
stations. Thus, we need to build large spacecraft memories to buffer satellite data, so
the satellite can store data over long periods (typically 12 to 18 hours) until it passes
over a single ground station at the user’s location. We also need to compress data on
the satellite, because ground stations with limited antennas and RF links may not sup-
port high data rates.

We cannot simply design the satellite to rely upon highly expert ground controllers.
The user organization typically does not know the special techniques of managing a
spacecraft. Thus, we need to use a single small computer to control the ground station,
so the user interface is a single machine. The ground station software should be simple
and well structured, containing on-line and written support. Where possible, we should
graphically represent the system status and the satellite orbit.

Whenever possible, the ground station should channel the user’s activity toward the
right solutions. Further, the ground station should be able to screen operator com-
mands and activities that may adversely affect the satellite operations. When deciding
how much effort to expend on the ground station, we must trade the real costs of the
user group learning, input errors, and more people to manage the satellite against the
cost of creating more capable software for the ground station.

Autonomy is another important factor in the cost of ground operations. Satellites in
LEO pass the ground station a few times per day, every day of the year. While novel
in the first few days and weeks, years of tending the satellite at roughly 6-hour inter-
vals can be a tremendous drain on the user organization. The ground station should at
least be able to buffer activities for a series of satellite passes. Thus, we should consid-
er features allowing longer autonomous periods in the system design. An alternative
to extended autonomy is remote operation. A dial-in system permitting limited control
of the ground station from a remote terminal can be valuable. Security is an issue in a
remote architecture, but we can devise various password and call-back schemes to
protect the system.
