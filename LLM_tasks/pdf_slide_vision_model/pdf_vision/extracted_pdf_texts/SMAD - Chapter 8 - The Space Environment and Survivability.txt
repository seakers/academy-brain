The near-Earth space and atmospheric environments strongly influence the per-
formance and lifetime of operational space systems by affecting their size, weight,
complexity, and cost. Some environmental interactions also limit the technical poten-
tial of these systems. They can lead to costly malfunctions or even the loss of compo-
nents or subsystems [Tribble, 1995; Hastings and Garrett, 1996; DeWitt et al., 1993].

By itself, operating under vacuum-like conditions can pose significant problems for
many spacecraft systems. When under vacuum, most organic materials will outgas
—the generation of spurious molecules which may act as contaminants to other
surfaces. Even before reaching orbit, particles from the atmosphere may fall onto
optical surfaces and degrade the performance of electro-optical instrumentation.
Because there is no practical way to clean spacecraft surfaces once the vehicle reaches
orbit, maintaining effective contamination control during design and development is a
significant issue for most spacecraft [Tribble et al., 1996].

Once orbit is obtained, the spacecraft is subjected to a very tenuous atmosphere
[Tascione, 1994]. At lower orbits a spacecraft will be bombarded by the atmosphere
at orbital velocities on the order of ~8 km/s. Interactions between the satellite and the
neutral atmosphere can erode satellite surfaces, affect the thermal and electrical
properties of the surface, and possibly degrade spacecraft structures.

At shuttle altitudes, ~300 km, about 1% of the atmosphere is ionized. This fraction
increases to essentially 100% ionization in the geosynchronous environment. The
presence of these charged particles, called the plasma environment, can cause differ-
ential charging of satellite components on the surface and interior of the vehicle. If
severe, this charging can exceed breakdown electric fields and the resulting electro-
static discharges may be large enough to disrupt electronic components. More energet-
ic space radiation, such as electrons with energies from about 200 keV to 1.5 MeV,
can become embedded in dielectric components and produce electrostatic discharges
in cable insulation and circuit boards. This bulk charging may disrupt a subsystem’s
signals or the operation of its devices. Even if mild, the charging may alter the electri-
cal potential of the spacecraft relative to space and affect the operation of scientific
instrumentation.

Very energetic (Me V-GeV) charged particles can be found in the trapped radiation
belts, solar flare protons, and galactic cosmic rays. The total dose effects of this high-
energy radiation can degrade microelectronic devices, solar arrays, and sensors. A
single energetic particle can also cause single-event phenomena within micro-
electronic devices which can temporarily disrupt or permanently damage components.

Lastly, orbiting spacecraft are periodically subjected to hypervelocity impacts by
1 pm or larger sized pieces of dust and debris. If the impacting particles originate in
nature they are termed micrometeoroids. If the particles are man-made they are termed
orbital debris. A single collision with a large micrometeoroid or piece of orbital debris
can terminate a mission. The probability of this occurring will increase significantly
with the introduction of large constellations of satellites.

The subject of space environment effects is, by itself, an area of active research.
The more critical of the various effects are discussed below.

8.1.1 The Solar Cycle

This subject is of particular interest because of the fact that the solar activity is seen
to vary with an 11-year cycle as shown in Fig. 8-1 [NOAA, 1991]. The plot shows the
F10.7 index, which is the mean daily flux at 10.7 cm wavelength in units of 10-22
W/m? - Hz. The peaks in the F10.7 index are called solar maxima, while the valleys
are called solar minima. Note that the variations are substantial on a day-to-day basis
and that one solar maximum may have levels that vary dramatically from other solar
maxima. Consequently, predicting the level at any given future time is highly
uncertain. On the other hand, the average over an extended period of time is well
known. As will be seen, many space environment effects are strongly dependent on
the solar cycle.

8.1.2 The Gravitational Field and Microgravity”

Microgravity, also called weightlessness, free fall, or zero-g, is the nearly complete
absence of any of the effects of gravity. In the microgravity environment of a satellite,
objects don’t fall, particles don’t settle out of solution, bubbles don’t rise, and convec-
tion currents don’t occur. Yet in low-Earth orbit, where all of these phenomena occur,
the gravitational force is about 90% of its value at the Earth’s surface. Indeed, it is the
gravitational field that holds the satellite in its orbit.

In Earth orbit microgravity comes about because the satellite is in free fall—i.e., it
is continuously falling through space and all of the parts of the satellite are falling
together. In a circular orbit the forward velocity of the spacecraft (tangential to the
direction to the Earth) is just enough that the continual falling of the spacecraft toward
the Earth keeps the satellite at the same distance from the Earth’s center. Moving ina
circular orbit requires a continuous acceleration toward the center.

The term microgravity is used in the space environment because, in practice, zero
gravity cannot actually be achieved. Two objects traveling very near each other in
orbit will not travel in quite the same path due to differences in the gravitational forces
or external nongravitational forces acting on them. Two objects held side by side and
dropped from a tall building will both accelerate toward the center of the Earth and, as
they fall, will converge slightly toward each other. From the point of view of the
objects, there is a small component of Earth gravity that pulls them toward each other.
An orbiting spacecraft under the influence of atmospheric drag or solar radiation pres-
sure will feel a very small force due to this external pressure. This force can mimic the
effect of gravity, causing heavy particles in solution to settle toward the front end of a
moving spacecraft. Similarly, a rotating spacecraft produces “artificial gravity” due to
centrifugal force. Finally, tidal forces, sometimes called gravity-gradient forces, come
about because of very small differences in the force of gravity over an extended object.
For a spherical bubble drifting in orbit, the force of gravity on the lower edge of the
bubble will be stronger than at the center of mass and weaker at the far edge of the
bubble. This very small difference in forces results in “tides” which will distort the
shape of the bubble and elongate it toward and away from the direction to the Earth.

For most practical applications, microgravity effects in low-Earth orbit can be
reduced to the level of 10-6 g = 1 pg). A level of 10-7 g can be achieved over a very
small region near the center of mass of the spacecraft. Table 8-1 provides formulas for
the most common forces in the microgravity environment. In this table, z is the
direction toward nadir and Z is the acceleration in the nadir direction. wis the angular
velocity of the satellite in its orbit. Note that for a nadir-pointing spacecraft, the space-
craft rotates in inertial space at a rate of one rotation per orbit and thus will add to the
acceleration environment due to the centrifugal force of this rotation. In low-Earth

206 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1

orbit, the lowest microgravity level can be achieved in an inertially-oriented spacecraft
rather than a nadir-oriented spacecraft. The last row in Table 8-1 is the coriolis force
which is an apparent sidewise force that occurs whenever objects move (e.g., fluid
flow in a chemical process) in a rotating reference frame, such as a gravity-gradient
stabilized spacecraft.

Table 8-2 uses the formulas in the previous table to compute the conditions under
which 1 pg is achieved. This gives an idea of the scale over which specific micro-
gravity values can be obtained. Microgravity levels could be substantially lowered by
conducting microgravity experiments well away from the vicinity of the Earth or other
large objects.

Microgravity leads to a wide variety of chemical and manufacturing processes that
cannot occur on the surface of the Earth. Heavier particles in a solution do not settle
out and bubbles do not rise to the surface. This allows uniform, universal mixing and
permits chemical reactions to occur that could not occur on Earth because separation
or weight collapse would hinder completion of the reaction or hardening of the
material. Surface tension and other inter-molecular forces can take over that would

8.1 The Space Environment 207

otherwise be dominated by gravitational settling. Similarly, convection does not occur
in space and heated materials do not churn or boil. This allows differential heating to
take place to provide other chemical reactions. Because settling does not occur, very
large crystals can be formed in space which have a variety of industrial applications.
Containerless processing and working in the vacuum of space can lead to extremely
pure chemicals for use in both pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. Microgravity is a
whole new science which is just beginning to evolve.

8.1.3 The Upper Atmosphere*

The upper atmosphere affects spacecraft by generating aerodynamic drag lift and
heat, and through the chemically corrosive effects of highly reactive elements such as
atomic oxygen. The effects of aerodynamic lift and heating are important during
launch and reentry. Aerodynamic drag is addressed in Sec. 6.2.3.

Drag depends on the ballistic coefficient (which is a function of atmospheric com-
position and temperature), velocity relative to the wind, and atmospheric density. We
can either estimate the ballistic coefficient based on the configuration of the space-
craft, or bound the problem using typical upper and lower limits as shown in Table 8-3.

sectional area and drag coefficients are estimated from the approximate shape,
size, and orientation of the satellite and solar arrays. [XA = cross-sectional]

208 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1

Strong drag occurs in dense atmospheres, and satellites with perigees below
~120 km have such short lifetimes that their orbits have no practical importance.
Above ~600 km, on the other hand, drag is so weak that orbits usually last more than
the satellites’ operational lifetimes. At this altitude, perturbations in orbital period are
so slight that we can easily account for them without accurate knowledge of the atmo-
spheric density. At intermediate altitudes, roughly two variable energy sources cause
large variations in atmospheric density and generate orbital perturbations.‘These vari-
ations can be predicted with two empirical models: the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent
Scatter (MSIS) and the Jacchia models [Hedin, 1986; Jacchia, 1977].

Altitudes between 120 and 600 km are within the Earth’s thermosphere, the region
above 90 km where the absorption of extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun results
in a very rapid increase in temperature with altitude. At ~200—-250 km, this tem-
perature approaches a limiting value, called the exospheric temperature, the average
values of which range between ~600 and 1,200 K over a typical solar cycle. The ther-
mosphere may also be strongly heated from geomagnetic activity, which transfers
energy from the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Heating of the thermosphere
increases atmospheric density because the thermosphere’s expansion causes increased
pressure at fixed altitudes.

Heating due to extreme ultraviolet radiation and its solar cycle variation has the
greatest effect on satellite lifetimes. Geomagnetic disturbances are generally too brief
to significantly affect lifetimes. Extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is com-
pletely absorbed before it reaches the ground and is not measured routinely by
satellite-borne instruments; consequently, its effects are unpredictable. Solar activity
is monitored using such proxy indices as sunspot number and the F10.7 index which
was previously discussed.

Figures 8-1 to 8-4 provide a means of estimating satellite lifetimes based on the
information available to the mission designer. Figure 8-2 provides the atmospheric
density as a function of altitude corresponding to various values of the F10.7 index.
Densities were obtained from the MSIS atmospheric model (Hedin, 1986]. Below
about 150 km, the density is not strongly affected by solar activity. However, at
satellite altitudes in the range of 500 to 800 km, the density variations between solar
maximum and solar minimum are approximately 2 orders of magnitude.

The large variations in density imply that satellites will decay more rapidly during
periods of solar maxima and much more slowly during solar minima. This is clearly
demonstrated in Fig. 8-3 which shows the altitude as a function of date for a set of 9
hypothetical satellites launched over a 6-year period. We assume that all of the satel-
lites were launched in a perfectly circular orbit at 700 km altitude—3 in 1956 at the
beginning of a solar maximum, 3 in 1959 toward the end of the solar maximum, and
3 in 1962 near the time of solar minimum. In each group one satellite had a ballistic
coefficient of 20 kg/m2, one was at 65 kg/m2, and one at 200 kg/m2. The histories of
the 9 satellites are shown in the graph.

Several characteristics of satellite decay are easily seen in Fig. 8-3. Satellites decay
very little during solar minimum, and then rapidly during solar maximum. For one
satellite, each solar maximum period will generally produce larger decay than the
previous maximum because the satellite is lower. It will, of course, depend on the level
of the particular solar maximum. The effect of the solar maxima will also depend on
the satellite ballistic coefficient. Those with a low ballistic coefficient will respond
quickly to the atmosphere and will tend to decay promptly. Those with high ballistic
coefficients will push through a larger number of solar cycles and will decay much

cycles than in years. All 9 satellites reentered during periods of solar maximum. For
the range of ballistic coefficients shown, the lifetimes varied from approximately half
of a solar cycle (5 years) to 17 solar cycles (190 years). Predicting where the satellite
would come down would be remarkably difficult.

8.1 The Space Environment 211

Figure 8-4 summarizes satellite decay in a convenient manner for mission analysis
use. The 3 sets of curves show lifetime as a function of initial circular altitude for
satellites with ballistic coefficients that are low (20 kg/m2), moderate (65 kg/m), and
high (200 kg/m2). The spread in the curves near the middle represents the difference
between solar maximum (F10.7 = 225) and solar minimum (F10.7 = 75). At the left of
the figure, below about 200 km, satellite orbits decay within a few days, the atmo-
spheric density is largely independent of the solar cycle (see Fig. 8-11), and the upper
and lower curves for each coefficient begin to merge. From there to lifetimes of about
half a solar cycle (approximately 5 years) there will be a very strong difference
between satellites launched at the start of solar minimum (upper curve) and those
launched at the start of solar maximum (lower curve). Also note that the difference
between the solar maximum and solar minimum curves is larger for satellites with a
lower ballistic coefficient as we would expect. (Balloons respond to drag more than
bowling balls do.) After about half a solar cycle, satellites on the upper curve of each
pair will hit solar maximum and the curve will become much flatter. In contrast, those
on the lower curve will hit solar minimum and will nearly stop decaying such that the
curve becomes nearly vertical. This oscillatory pattern continues with a frequency of
the 11-year solar cycle as can be seen in the upper portion of the curves. Finally at high
altitudes and long lifetimes the curves come together because the satellite will see a
large number of solar cycles and it will make very little difference when the satellite
starts. of course the actual lifetime for any particular satellite will depend on both the
actual F10.7 index variations and the design and attitude history of the satellite. None-
theless, Fig. 8-13 provides an estimate of the extrema for use in mission design and
can be used to estimate the lifetime for a specific satellite if the ballistic coefficient and
launch date relative to the solar cycle are know.

Atomic oxygen—the predominant atmospheric constituent from ~200 km to
~600 km—is another important part of the upper atmosphere’s effect on space
systems. This form of oxygen can react with thin organic films, advanced composites,
and metallized surfaces [Visentine, 1988], resulting in degraded sensor performance.
For example, Kapton, a material commonly used for insulation and seals, erodes at a
rate of approximately 2.8 um for every 1024 atoms/m?2 of atomic oxygen fluence
[Leger et al., 1984]. The fluence, A, over a time interval T, is given by

Fy = pyVT (8-1)

where (,, is the number density of atomic oxygen (see Fig. 8-5), and Vis the satellite
velocity. (See tables on inside rear cover.) In addition, chemical reactions involving
atomic oxygen may produce radiatively active, excited constituents which, in turn,
emit significant amounts of background radiation, create effects such as “Shuttle
glow,” and interfere with optical sensors.

Atomic oxygen forms when solar ultraviolet radiation dissociates molecular
oxygen. Above 110 km, atmospheric constituents diffuse, and each constituent’s
density varies with altitude according to its scale height. The scale height of a
constituent is the height change over which the density drops to 1/e of its value. In
diffusive equilibrium, the scale height is inversely proportional to its molecular
weight. Thus, the density of light constituents decreases less rapidly with altitude than
the density of heavy constituents, and eventually the light constituents dominate the
mixture of gases. Atomic oxygen is lighter than the molecular nitrogen and oxy-
gen; therefore, near ~170 km altitude, atomic oxygen becomes the most abundant
constituent.

Fig. 8-5. Altitude Profiles of Number Density of Atomic Oxygen at Solar Minimum (Solid
Line) and Solar Maximum (Dashed Line).

Figure 8-5 shows altitude profiles of atomic oxygen number density over the
equator for F10.7 values of 50 and 250. These values represent the extremes for solar
minimum and maximum, respectively. The profiles are based on predictions from the
MSIS model {Hedin, 1986] for 3 p.m. local time at northern hemisphere equinox and
for geomagnetically quiet conditions [Walterscheid, 1989]. Up to 150 km, the solar-
cycle variation is small, but it increases steadily with increasing altitude. By 300 km,
the number density of atomic oxygen at solar maximum becomes an order of magni-
tude greater than at solar minimum.

The large solar-cycle variation in atomic oxygen means spacecraft materials can be
selected based on phasing the mission to the solar cycle. Since there are large differ-
ences between solar cycles, material choices made on the basis of average solar max-
imum conditions may be inappropriate because of the possibility of more extreme
solar maximum conditions.

8.1.4 Plasmas, The Magnetic Field, and Spacecraft Charging”
The Earth’s magnetic field is roughly dipolar; that is,
B(R,A) = (1 + sin? A)!/2 By/R3 (8-2)

where B is the local magnetic field intensity, A is the magnetic latitude, R is the radial
distance measured in Earth radii (Rg), and Bg is the magnetic field at the equator at the
Earth’s surface [By = B(R = Rp, A= 0) = 0.30 gauss].

As shown in Fig. 8-6, the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth’s
magnetic field causes magnetic field on the night side of the Earth to stretch into a very
elongated structure known as the magnetotail (see Tsyganenko [1987] for a more
complete model of the Earth’s magnetic field). A thin plasma sheet bifurcates the
magnetotail, which extends over 1,000 Earth radii parallel to the flow velocity of the
solar wind.

Fig. 8-6. A Cross Section of the Earth’s Magnetosphere. It shows the key plasma and
energetic particle populations which respond to variations in solar wind parameters.

Through the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field,
some of the solar wind’s kinetic energy is converted to magnetic energy stored in the
magnetotail. Because this energy cannot build up indefinitely, magnetic substorms
dissipate it from time to time. These substorms produce an energized plasma (5 to
50 keV) that is injected toward the Earth. This hot plasma can extend into geosynchro-
nous orbits, charging the surface of any spacecraft within it to high negative voltages.

The electrical potential of a spacecraft or component is measured with respect to
the plasma in which it is immersed where the net current flow is zero. That is, the
following currents must cancel each other: (1) the electron current from the plasma to
the vehicle, (2) the ion current from the plasma to the vehicle, (3) the secondary elec-
tron current, (4) the backscattered electron current, and (5) the photoelectron current.
The voltage at the component’s surface also depends on the material’s capacitance
with respect to the surrounding materials, especially the vehicle ground.

Because materials have varying secondary emission coefficients and photoelectron
currents, their equilibrium potentials also differ. An electrostatic arc occurs if the elec-
tric field exceeds the breakdown field along the surface of the material, through the
material, or between adjacent materials. Electromagnetic interference, EMI, from
such arcs can cause spacecraft to operate erratically [Robinson, 1989].

Surface charging detrimental to vehicle operation occurs mainly in orbits where
electrons with energies of 10 to 20 keV dominate the electron current from the plasma
to the vehicle. At low altitudes this charging occurs only at high latitudes where
auroral electrons collide with the vehicle which is passing through an otherwise cold,
low-density plasma [Gussenhoven et al., 1985]. For other low-altitude locations, low-
energy electrons usually develop enough current to keep electric fields below
breakdown levels.

In higher orbits, such as geosynchronous, surface charging occurs during mag-
netospheric substorms between the longitudes corresponding to midnight and dawn
[Fennell et al., 1983]. We can approximate the electron-flux distribution during a
substorm by summing a cold and a hot Maxwellian distribution. The cold component
has a density of 0.2 cm-3 and a temperature of 0.4 keV; the hot component has a

214 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1

density of about 2.3 cm-3 and a temperature of 25 keV [Mullen et al., 1981]. We must
design spacecraft which either keep the differential charging caused by this plasma
well below breakdown potentials, or can tolerate the resulting electrostatic discharges.

Design guidelines are available to help reduce differential potentials on vehicle
surfaces [Purvis et al., 1984; Vampola et al., 1985]. For example, we can select candi-
date materials and conductive coatings, apply numerical or analytical models using
their quantifiable characteristics, and determine their differential potentials in space.
If we cannot prevent discharges by selecting alternative materials, we might consider
alternatives such as special filtering, cabling, or grounding. We can employ coupling
models for electromagnetic interference simulation, and test the vehicle for electro-
static discharges in its flight configuration.

It is important to note that while differential charging as discussed in the preceding
paragraphs is not seen in lower equatorial orbits, the spacecraft potential may be as
much as 90% of the solar array voltage more negative than that of the surrounding
plasma depending on the configuration of the spacecraft electrical power supply. This
may be aconcern on scientific missions, where nonbiased measurements of the plasma
environment are desired, and may also give rise to arcing or other undesirable effects
if high voltage power supplies are used [Tribble, 1995].

8.1.5 Radiation and Associated Degradation

Trapped Radiation*

The Van Allen radiation belts are a permanent hazard to orbiting spacecraft. They
consist of electrons and ions (mostly protons) having energies greater than 30 keV and
are distributed nonuniformly within the magnetosphere. As illustrated in Fig. 8-7, the
energetic electrons preferentially populate a pair of toroidal regions centered on the
magnetic shells L ~ 1.3 (inner zone) and L ~ 5 (outer zone).

8.1 The Space Environment 215

A magnetic L-shell is the surface generated by rotating a magnetic field line around
the dipole axis. It approximately satisfies the equation

R = Lcos2 A (8-3)

where R is the distance in Earth radii from the idealized point dipole near the Earth’s
center, and A is the magnetic latitude. Thus, the L value of a dipolar magnetic shell is
its equatorial radius measured in Earth radii. A generalized concept of L, introduced
by McIlwain [1961], takes account of the way higher harmonics of the main
geomagnetic field perturb the motion of charged particles from their dipolar trajec-
tories. Normally, we use this concept instead of the dipole L value for mapping the
trapped radiation environment. Standard models of the Van Allen belts are available
from the National Space Science Data Center. The model which provides inner zone
(L = 1.2 - 2.4) electron data is AE8, which has an average energy range of 40 keV to
5 MeV [Bilitza et al., 1988]. AE8 has two forms, AE8MIN and AE8MAX, which
represent the time-averaged environments during solar minimum and maximum.

Outer-zone electron fluxes vary much more over time than inner-zone fluxes.
Indeed, during a major magnetic storm, the equatorial intensity at a given energy and
L value may grow by several orders of magnitude (factors of 10) in less than a day.
Between storms, such flux enhancements usually decay exponentially with an energy-
dependent lifetime t ~ 10 E(MeV) days at L > 3.

Available proton models are AP8MIN and AP8MAX, which also represent the
solar minimum and maximum periods, At solar maximum, the increased atmospheric
densities decrease the proton fluxes because the trapped protons collide with the
atmosphere at low altitudes. The AP8 models cover the energy range from 100 keV to
> 400 MeV. Figure 8-8 shows some of AP8MIN’s typical contours for proton fluxes
in (R, A) space. Since the MIN model predicts slightly more flux than the MAX model,
it can be used during solar maximum or as a conservative model for long-term
missions.

(Note a somewhat different scale.) Data is the omnidirectional flux from the AP8MIN

Using the energetic proton models (e.g., AP8) is difficult because they are
organized in terms of B (local magnetic field intensity) and L. Secular variations in the
Earth’s magnetic field drive the normally stable energetic protons toward lower
altitudes and the models do not take this into account. Thus, if we project the magnetic

field more than 10-15 years into the future, our calculations will be invalid for low-
altitude orbits [Konradi and Hardy, 1987]. The present and future configurations of the
inner-zone proton belt probably will not differ much, provided both are described in
terms of L and A.

We can determine the appropriate amount of shielding for future spacecraft by
computing the dose rate for the desired orbit as a function of shield thickness. To do
so, we must apply a radiation transport computation to the time-averaged space
environment. Figure 8-9 shows how various shielding depths affect radiation doses in
low-altitude polar orbits. Figure 8-10 shows results for geosynchronous satellites. A
rad is that amount of radiation which deposits 100 ergs (= 6.25 x 107 MeV) per gram
of target material (100 mils of aluminum is equivalent to 0.686 g/cm2). The total
radiation dose consists of three components: proton dose, electron dose, and
bremsstrahlung X-ray dose produced by the interaction of electrons with the shielding
material. In low-Earth orbits, energetic protons in the inner radiation belt contribute
most to the total radiation dose. Radiation dose strongly depends on altitude; below
1,000 km the dose increases at approximately the 5th power of the altitude. At
synchronous altitude the greater than 5 MeV proton dose is negligible and the
bremsstrahlung dose dominates the electron dose for shield thicknesses greater than
1 cm.

Figure 8-10 illustrates that protons trapped near a geosynchronous orbit do not have
enough energy to penetrate 10 mils of aluminum. Nevertheless, many trapped protons
and heavier ions in this region of space have energies around 10-200 keV. These
lower-energy ions can harm space systems differently than penetrating radiation. By
depositing their energy in the spacecraft skin, the lower-energy ions can cause a tem-
perature rise sufficient to significantly enhance the infrared background. Heat loads of
up to 0.5 W/m? are possible. These same low-energy ions can degrade the effective-
ness of paints and protective glass by breaking chemical bonds in their surface layers.
We cannot shield against these effects.

Solar Particle Events*

Solar particle events (SPEs) occur in association with solar flares. SPEs are rapid
increases in the flux of energetic particles (~ 1 MeV to above 1 GeV) lasting from
several hours to several days. On the average, only a few SPEs occur per year;
however, they have important consequences for man-made systems and for man in
space. For example, they degrade solar array elements, increase background noise in
many types of electro-optical sensors, and cause illnesses in astronauts.

Figure 8-11 shows the typical evolution over time of a solar particle event observed
near Earth. The profile depends on the time evolution of the originating solar flare,
how long the energetic particles take to diffuse within the solar corona and how the
particles propagate within the interplanetary medium. Protons of relativistic energies
arrive at Earth within minutes after the flare’s occurrence. Lower energy (~10’s of
MeV) protons are slowed by diffusion within the solar corona and by interactions with
the interplanetary medium. After a solar particle event occurs, proton fluxes decay to
background noise values over several days. The practical importance of an individual
event depends on its maximum intensity, its duration, and the relative abundance of
the highest-energy components and heavy nuclei.

The frequency of proton events peaks within a year or two of sunspot maximum and
diminishes greatly during the few years surrounding sunspot minimum. Nevertheless,
intense events can occur virtually any time within the 11-year sunspot cycle except at
sunspot minimum. Table 8-4 shows when the most and fewest sunspots will occur for
solar cycles 21-25.

The intensities of typical solar proton events closely follow a log-normal distribu-
tion [Jursa, 1985; King, 1974; Feynman et al., 1988]; thus, a few individual events can
dominate the total proton fluence observed over a complete solar cycle. Table 8-5
shows the parameters of this distribution. For example, using the values in Table 8-5,
a typical solar proton event has a fluence above 10 MeV of 108-27 cm-2, whereas an
extreme (30) event would contribute 10(8-27 + 3 x 0.59) om-2 = 1.1 x 10!9 cm-2.

satellite missions). Solar array outputs typically degrade by a few percent following
exposure to fluences above ~109 cm-? at energies over ~| MeV, but actual degradation
rates depend on cell type, cover glass thickness, and cell age.

Galactic Cosmic Rays*

Galactic cosmic rays, or GCR, are particles which reach the vicinity of the Earth
from outside the solar system. The number and type of nuclei in these particles are
proportional to those in solar system material. Figure 8-13 shows the energy spectrum
for several elements. The sum of the curves in the lower energy portion of the figure
suggests that cosmic rays undergo solar-cycle modulation.

Cosmic rays pose a serious hazard because a single particle can cause a malfunction
in common electronic components such as random access memory, microprocessors,
and hexfet power transistors. When a single passing particle causes this malfunction,
we call radiation effects single-event phenomena, or SEP.

A galactic cosmic ray loses energy mainly by ionization. This energy loss depends
chiefly on the square of the particle’s charge, Z, and can be increased if the particle

220 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1

undergoes nuclear interactions within an electronic part. Thus, lower-Z (and more
abundant) ions deposit as much energy in a device as less abundant, higher-Z ions.
When the galactic cosmic ray leaves electron-hole pairs in a depletion region of an
electronic device, the electric field in that region sweeps up the pairs. Figure 8-14
shows this process schematically.

tronic Device.

Single-event phenomena include three different effects in electronic components.
The first is the so-called bitflip, or single-event upset (SEU), which neither damages
the part nor interferes with its subsequent operation. The second is single-event latch-
up (SEL). In this case, the part hangs up, draws excessive current, and will no longer
operate until the power to the device is turned off and then back on. The excessive
current drawn in the latched condition can destroy the device if the power supply
cannot handle the current. When latchup demands too much current for the power
supply, it may drag down the bus voltage, or even damage supply. The third effect is
single-event burnout (SEB). This causes the device to fail permanently.

To evaluate the frequency of single-event phenomena for a given part, we must
know three things: the external environment; how the incident energy spectrum and
particle intensity change as a particle passes through the spacecraft to the sensitive
device; and how the electronic device responds to ionizing radiation. We find these
phenomena difficult to evaluate because of the complex interactions between the radi-
ation environment and the device’s circuit elements. On-orbit failure rates can be
predicted primarily for single-event upsets in memory devices, with well defined
sensitive volumes, in which the galactic cosmic rays produce electron-hole pairs. A
useful equation developed by Petersen [1995] expresses the upset rate R as follows:

R = 200 0;/1905 (8-4)

where R is the number of upsets or errors per bit day, 07, is the limiting cross section
(sensitive area) of the device in cm2, and Lp 5 is the linear energy transfer (LET) at
25% of the limiting cross section in units of MeV/mg/cm2. If experimental cross
section data is not available, but device modeling data is, then geometric data can be
used in conjunction with the predicted critical charge, and now

R= 2x 10-10 abe2/Q,? (8-5)

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 221

where R is the number of errors per bit day, a and b are device surface dimensions in
um, c is the device depth in um, and Q, is the critical charge in pC. These two equa-
tions have been shown to predict upset rates in the geosynchronous orbit for solar
minimum conditions with reasonable accuracy. Scale factors for estimating error rates
for other orbits and other calculational methods may be found in Petersen [1995].

Single-event upset rates in complex devices such as microprocessors, or single-
event latchups or burnouts in any devices, cannot be reliably predicted. We must resort
to predictions based on simulated accelerator test observations and flight performance
of similar devices.

Galactic cosmic rays can also generate background noise in various satellite
subsystems such as star sensors, infrared detectors, and components employing
charge-coupled devices. In addition to increased noise signals, these rays create
spurious events which can masquerade as real signals. The spurious signals can affect
satellite subsystems depending on the genuine signals’ frequency of occurrence, time
duration, and repetition, as well as the sophistication of the sensor system. Galactic
cosmic rays are a potential source of background noise which must be taken into
account when designing a satellite system. It should also be noted that, while this sec-
tion addresses effects of galactic cosmic rays, similar effects are caused by high energy
protons and must be considered for orbits in the range of 1,000-10,000 km altitude.

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements

Paul Nordin, The Boeing Company
Malcolm K. Kong, TRW Systems & Information Technology Group

Survivability is the ability of a space system to perform its intended function after
being exposed to a stressing natural environment or one created by an enemy or hostile
agent. Hardness is an attribute defining the environmental stress level which a space
system can survive. As an example, a satellite or spacecraft which can withstand an
X-ray fluence of 1.0 cal/cm? or absorption of 107 rads (Si) of total dose (a rad of
absorbed dose is approximately 100 ergs/g) has a hardness of that amount. (Fluence is
the time integral of flux. Flux is the flow of energy per unit time and per unit cross-
sectional area.)

In the aerospace industry we now consider both natural and hostile environments
in the definition of hardness and survivability. Well-developed technologies, evolved
over the last 35 years, make it possible to design satellites to withstand natural and
modest levels of hostile environments. Although technologies for hardening against
hostile military threats and for natural survival of satellites overlap, they are distinct
and are usually treated separately except in the areas of survivability to total dose due
to the Van Allen belts, single-event effects (SEE) caused by galactic cosmic rays and
high energy protons, and space/bulk charging due to naturally occurring space plas-
mas. The latter phenomena must be treated synergistically in the design of satellites.

A military space system or commercial satellite must be survivable if we will need
its services in times of high stress, such as a nuclear war. To do this, we must under-
stand what may cause the system to malfunction and then design it to protect against
failures. Survivability requirements include identifying the environments and their
intensities and, in most cases, designing the space system so it will continue to perform
its intended function for a specified time after exposure.

222 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

Commercial or scientific satellites usually do not need to be survivable to military
threats, but planners must be aware that an unhardened satellite may prematurely stop
operating after even very distant nuclear explosions. A slight hardening of satellites
can make them much more survivable. (See Sec. 8.2.3.) The Starfish high-altitude
nuclear test of July 9, 1962, illustrates the vulnerability of unhardened satellites. That
test, a 1.4 megaton device at 400 km altitude above Johnston Island in the Pacific
Ocean, caused the failure of several satellites when electrons became trapped in the
Earth’s geomagnetic field. As a result of those failures, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
established hardening guidelines for all military satellites, including operational and
experimental ones. Ritter [1979] discusses these guidelines.

Studies were conducted by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (formerly the
Defense Special Weapons Agency) [Webb, et al., 1995] on the possible effects of a
small Third World nuclear burst (for example, 50 kT at 120 km altitude over the East
Asian Peninsula) on known commercial (unhardened) satellites. Satellites considered
included Hubble Space Telescope, Iridium, ORBCOMM, Globalstar, NOAA, and
Nimbus. These satellites showed lifetime reductions of 67% to as large as 99%.

It is important to consider survivability from the outset of mission design. For
example, if the satellite can function within a range of orbit altitudes, the highest of
these is both the hardest to attack and the most expensive to reach. We should consider
the system’s survival in each of its life-cycle phases, including concept definition,
engineering design and development, and operations in orbit. Note, however, that
historically we have not hardened launch systems because of cost and weight, as well
as undefined need. The main military threats against space systems are nuclear
weapons, including directed energy designs such as X-ray lasers; ground- and space-
based laser weapons; high-velocity-pellet (fragmentation) weapons; high-power
radio frequency (microwave) weapons; homing kinetic energy weapons; and beam
weapons using neutral atomic particles. We may use several approaches to make a
system survivable, with hardening of the satellite as a key element. Section 8.2.4
describes these possible approaches and discusses their approximate cost and relative
effectiveness.

8.2.1 The Nuclear Weapons Environment and Its Effect on Space Systems

Nuclear weapons pose the most severe threat to spacecraft or space systems. The
yield, or explosive power, and accuracy of delivery are such that if a nuclear weapon
directly attacks a spacecraft, ground station, or any other node of a space system, the
node will be destroyed. Nuclear weapon yields can range from a few tons to many
megatons of TNT equivalent (one kiloton of TNT is defined to be 10!” calories). Future
nuclear exchanges could use yields of a few hundred kilotons to a few megatons,
depending on the purpose of the specific attack and the weapon’s delivery accuracy.
Accurate delivery of low yields will achieve the desired kill probability, whereas less
accurate delivery requires higher yields.

Approximately 80% of the energy from a nuclear weapon detonated in space
appears in the form of X-rays. Other important effects include small amounts of
gamma rays and neutrons, as well as small fractions in residual radioactivity and
kinetic energy of bomb debris. For additional technical detail on nuclear weapons
effects, see Glasstone and Dolan [1977].

X-Radiation. The X-radiation occurs because just after detonation, nuclear bomb
material is at 10-100 million K. As a first approximation, the hot bomb material will

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 223

very quickly radiate the energy as though it were a black body, according to the Stefan-
Boltzmann’s law:

E =oT*4 (8-6)
where E is the energy in W/m2, Tis the absolute temperature in K, and ois the Stefan-
Boltzmann’s constant (5.67 x 10-8 W- m-2- K-4). At higher black-body temperatures,
more X-ray photons are emitted at higher energies. (This is Wien’s law, which states
that A, qx T= constant, where A,,,., is the wavelength at maximum intensity and T is
the absolute temperature of the blackbody.)

The X-ray fluence, F,, at a distance R from a nuclear detonation of yield Y is given
by

F, =f, Y/(4 0R2) (8-7a)
= 6.4Y/R2 (8-8a)

where f, is the fraction of the energy emitted as X-rays (= 0.8) and in the numerical
form F, is in cal/cm2, Y is in kilotons, and R is in km.

Neutron Radiation. One kiloton of equivalent nuclear energy arises from the
fission of approximately 1.45 x 1023 nuclei. Each fission produces 2 or 3 neutrons.
Approximately half of these neutrons escape during the few tens of nanoseconds of
energy generation. Accordingly, the neutron fluence at a distance R cm from a nuclear
detonation is given by

F,, = 0.5 x 2.5 x 1.45 x 1023Y/(42R2)
F,=1.4x 1012 Y/R2 n/cm? (8-9)

where FY is in kilotons, R is in km, and F, is in n/cm2. This equation is only approxi-
mate. The actual neutron output will depend upon the design of the nuclear weapon.

Prompt Radiation. Gamma radiation emitted during the actual nuclear burn time
is prompt radiation, whereas gamma rays emitted after the nuclear burn time are
delayed radiation. Prompt gammas result from fission reactions, neutron capture, and
inelastic neutron scattering events occurring during intense generation of nuclear
energy. The total energy and energy distribution of the prompt gamma rays depend on
the nuclear weapon’s specific design. To calculate preliminary survivability at range
R from a nuclear burst in space, we can express the dose, Dy, (energy deposited per
unit mass) in silicon semiconductor material from prompt gamma radiation as

Dy =4 x 1052/3 /R2 rads (Si) (8-10)

where R is in km, Y is in megatons, and Dy is in rads (Si).

Delayed Radiation. Delayed gammas, neutrons, positrons, and electrons—or
residual radiation—occur when radioactive fission products decay. For about the first
second after a nuclear explosion, the decay rate from residual nuclear radiation is
nearly constant. Thereafter, the dose rate follows the approximate law:

R = Ro (t/to)-12 (8-11)

where R is the dose rate (usually in rads/hr) at any elapsed time after the reference
time, fg, when the dose rate was Ro. The fission products causing this dose rate contain
more than 300 different isotopes of 36 elements from the periodic table, so the inverse
1.2 power of time is an approximation. It is accurate to within 25% for the first
6 months after the nuclear explosion [Glasstone and Dolan, 1977].

224 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

The explosion energy rapidly disperses residual radiation. In the absence of an
atmosphere and geomagnetic fields, the radioactive fission products would expand
geometrically and decrease in intensity by the inverse square of the distance from the
burst. However, the geomagnetic field causes the mostly ionized, radioactive weapon
debris to spiral along geomagnetic field lines, in a manner similar to the charged-
particle motion described in Sec. 8.1. Thus expansion of the radioactive debris will
depend on the magnetic field at the nuclear event and on the magnetic field’s config-
uration between the nuclear event and the satellite being considered. As a first
approximation, we can assume a geometric expansion. A more conservative approach,
however, would be to assume that the nuclear event and the satellite are on the same
geomagnetic field lines. The largest possible amount of radioactive debris would then
funnel from the nuclear event to the satellite.

An upper bound estimate of the delayed gamma flux due to radioactive debris, in
gammas or photons per square centimeter per second, from a single nuclear burst, is
given by

¥=9x10°¥/4nR2(1+1)'? photons /cm?/s (8-12)

where Y is yield in megatons (one-third of total yield assumed to be fission), R is
distance from the burst point in kilometers, and fis time after burst in seconds [Gold-
flam, 1990}. This estimate applies to cases where the debris strikes and plates outer
surfaces of a satellite, as well as cases where the debris is far away. Similarly, an esti-
mate of delayed beta debris can be made by applying a one-third factor to the equation.

Both delayed gammas and betas will manifest themselves as noise spikes in electro-
optical and visible sensor elements used on satellite systems (such as infrared
surveillance sensors, optical/visible sensors, Earth sensors, and star trackers). The
delayed gammas are a significant threat to satellites, since they can be reduced only by
very thick shielding with high Z materials.

Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). EMP is a secondary effect of nuclear weapon
detonations. X-rays and gamma rays impinging upon the upper atmosphere create an
electron flux which radiates in the RF region of the spectrum. EMP’s spectral energy
is mostly in the 1 MHz to 100 MHz range. As the RF energy arrives at a satellite, it
will induce currents and voltages that may damage or kill the satellite if we do not
design to protect it. Nominal electric field strengths, which satellites would experi-
ence, can vary from 3 to 100 V/m, depending on satellite altitude and burst location,
relative geometry, and other parameters.

System-Generated EMP, SGEMP, is a phenomenon caused when X-rays and
gamma rays hit a satellite or other system element, thereby creating an internal flux of
electrons whose electromagnetic interactions create large currents and voltages. These
large internal currents and voltages can damage sensitive components inside the satel-
lite. Section 8.2.3 discusses how we can mitigate these effects.

Geomagnetically Trapped Radiation. Following a nuclear burst at high altitude,
electrons caused by the weapon join the naturally occurring Van Allen radiation belts
(Sec. 8.1). The electron flux may increase by many orders of magnitude, thus increas-
ing the absorbed dose in unshielded materials as the satellite repeatedly traverses the
Van Allen belts. To protect solid-state (silicon) electronic circuits, we normally
enclose them in aluminum, with wall thickness ranging from 0.0254 cm (0.01 inch) to
a centimeter or more. Aluminum shielding with a thickness of 0.1 cm and a density of
2.71 g/cm corresponds to 0.27 g/cm2. Figure 8-9 of Sec. 8.1 gives the natural dose
rate in silicon, in rads per year, for polar orbits as a function of orbital altitude and for

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 225

several values of aluminum shielding. The dose scales linearly with time so the curves
can be used for longer or shorter durations. A polar orbit satellite will accumulate less
dose than an equatorial one because the trapped radiation is essentially nonexistent at
and near the geomagnetic poles of the Earth; this dose difference can be as large as a
factor of 5.

Figure 8-15B gives the dose resulting from a 30-day exposure to a nuclear weapon-
enhanced electron flux for one value of aluminum shielding and as a function of
orbital altitude. The dose for shorter periods can be estimated by linear scaling;
however, longer periods cannot be estimated by linear scaling since the saturated
environment decays rapidly. As with the natural trapped electrons, the nuclear

226 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

weapon-enhanced electron flux is practically nonexistent near the north and south
poles. For satellites with higher inclination orbits, i.e., greater than 60 to 70 deg, the
accumulated dose is greatly reduced, compared to satellites with inclinations of zero
to 60 or 70 deg.

An example will show how these calculations work in practice. Consider a satellite
which must operate for | year in the natural environment and then operate (survive)
for 1 day following a high altitude nuclear explosion which creates an electron-
enhanced Van Allen belt. We assume a circular orbit, 30 deg inclination and an
altitude of 6,000 km. For a wall thickness of 0.254 cm (corresponding to a shielding
value of 0.69 g/cm2), Fig. 8-15A gives a dose of about 130 krads in 1 year. Figure
8-15B gives a dose of 21 Mrads for 30 days and 700 krads for 1 day. Adding the two,
we get 830 krads. The electronics must be able to function properly after accumulating
a total dose of this amount. Solid-state electronics can be hardened to tolerate from a
few krads to about | Mrad so our satellite, if hardened to 830 krads or more, would
satisfy the survivability requirement of | year natural plus 1 day weapon enhanced.

Nuclear Weapon Effects on Materials. The X-radiation pulse lasts tens of nano-
seconds, and its energy is absorbed almost instantaneously in solid material through
the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. In the photoelectric effect, bound
electrons of the material are ejected from their atomic orbits and take on a kinetic
energy equal to the difference between the energy of the incident photon and the
atom’s ionization energy. The incident photon disappears in the photoelectric effect,
with its absorption per atom proportional to the 5th power of Z, the atomic number of
the absorbing material, and inversely proportional to the 7/3 power of the incident
photon’s energy [Heitler, 1954]. Therefore, high-Z materials shield against X-rays
more effectively, and the absorption cross section decreases dramatically for incident-
photon energy from | to 20 keV (1 keV = 1.6 x 10-16 J),

Compton scattering is an elastic scattering event in which an electron receives
some of the energy of the incident photon, and the incident photon changes direction.
As a result, the photon’s energy decreases and its wavelength increases [Heitler,
1954]. The cross section per atom for Compton scattering is proportional to Z and, for
the range of photon energies we are interested in, is inversely proportional to the inci-
dent photon’s energy. Therefore, for Compton scattering, increasing Z only slightly
increases the absorption coefficient, whereas the cross section decreases moderately
as the photon energy increases.

The energetic, free electrons described above can cause electronic circuits to
malfunction, and their energy ultimately appears as heat in the material. In fact, the
material heats rapidly enough to create shock waves which develop tensile stresses
that may cause spall at its unconstrained boundaries. If the deposited energy is high
enough (usually not the case at typical satellite fluence levels), the material may
vaporize or melt, creating direct damage in addition to the shock waves. For space-
craft, where flux or fluence levels are low, malfunction of electronic circuits is the
most likely occurrence.

Gamma rays resulting from nuclear explosions range from a few hundred keV to
several MeV. In preliminary designs, we can assume that gamma rays have a mean
energy of approximately ! MeV and interact with matter primarily through Compton
scattering. Because gamma radiation is very penetrating, we cannot effectively shield
against it. Thus, when we wish to protect against the less penetrating, but more highly
ionizing, X-radiation, we need only provide enough shielding to reduce the prompt
dose to levels approximately equal to that of gamma radiation. Figure 8-18 of

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 227

Sec. 8.2.3 gives the prompt dose induced by a unit fluence of X-radiation as a function
of additional shielding (the abscissa of the figure can be converted to linear dimensions
by dividing by the density of the shielding material). For higher or lower fluences,
linear scaling is appropriate.

Neutrons interact with material by colliding with atomic nuclei. The collisions
impart energy to the atoms of the material and displace the atoms from their normal
positions in the lattice. Changing the lattice structure can seriously harm solid-state
electronic devices because they depend on the characteristics of the lattice for their
function. At fluences greater than about 10!2 n/cm2, neutrons can cause solid-state
devices to stop working, thus “electronically killing” a satellite.

Effects on Communications. A nuclear weapon detonated in space near the Earth
interacts strongly with the atmosphere and the Earth’s magnetic field. The electromag-
netic energy radiated from the detonation creates large-scale ionization in the bomb
material and in the atmosphere. Radioactive debris contributes beta particles
(positrons and electrons) from radioactive decay. The ionized bomb debris and beta
particles move along the lines of force of the geomagnetic field, as described in
Sec. 8.1. As the magnetic field lines enter the atmosphere, the energetic particles
interact with it, creating more ions and electrons. The free electrons thus created
absorb and reradiate RF energy and refract the electromagnetic waves of the radio
communications links between ground and satellite, creating phase and amplitude
changes. These in turn reduce the signal strength in radio receivers, thus interrupting
communications.

Based on the theory of electromagnetic propagation, the attenuation, a, in dB per
km, is given by

a=44x 104N,v/((2 nf? + v2) dB/km (8-13)

where N, is the number of electrons per cm}, v is the frequency of collision of electrons
with ions, atoms or molecules in Hz, and f is the frequency of the electromagnetic
radiation in Hz. The values of these parameters are difficult, if not impossible, to
obtain. However, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (formerly the Defense
Special Weapons Agency) can provide computer programs for propagation analyses
in nuclear environments, assuming appropriate clearances and need to know can be
established.

For space-to-ground links, we can use the form of Eq. (8-13) and the fact that the
density distribution of the atmosphere is approximately exponential to infer the
absorptive behavior of RF signals as a function of frequency. The form of Eq. (8-13)
indicates that the absorption passes through a maximum as a function of collision
frequency, v, which is proportional to the density of air. Above approximately 80 km,
the density is so low that v is essentially zero and absorption does not occur. Below
about 60 km, electrons rapidly reattach to atoms and molecules, so the low electron
density again leads to small absorption. Therefore, the attenuation is at a maximum for
any given radiation frequency between 60 and 80 km. In this region the attenuation
varies with the inverse square of the radiation frequency. Thus, we should choose the
highest communication frequency we can to minimize attenuation due to nuclear
weapons environments. For a more complete treatment of nuclear effects on commu-
nications, see Mohanty [1991].

High data rate requirements for military satellites with surveillance sensor payloads
and future commercial communications satellites have resulted in the use of optical/
laser links in modern systems. While having many advantages over RF links, such as

228 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

weight and power, optical link components are also affected by nuclear environments.
Table 8-6 contains general guidelines for the effects of nuclear radiation on optical link
components.

8.2.2 Other Hostile Environments

Laser Weapons. High-power lasers are being developed as potential ground-based
or space-based antisatellite weapons. The flux in power per cross-sectional area from
these weapons is given by

PF a=
mR? [(1.224Q)° + (JD) ] (8-14)

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 229

where P is the average output power, D is the laser objective diameter, Q is the quality
of the laser beam (dimensionless), A is the wavelength of the laser, J is the angular
jitter of the beam (in rad), and R is the range from the laser to the target. Q = 1 indicates
a diffraction-limited weapon; laser weapons being developed will have a beam quality
of 1.5 to 3.0. Both pulsed and continuous-wave lasers are in development. Equation
(8-14) is for a continuous-wave laser, but is approximately correct for the average flux
from a pulsed laser. The peak flux for a pulsed laser will be much higher.

For engagement ranges of several hundred km, the laser spot sizes will be several
meters in diameter and will, in general, completely engulf the target satellite in laser
radiation. To damage or kill a satellite at any range, the laser beam must hold steady
long enough to achieve a damaging or killing level. Depending on the incident flux
level and sensitivity, this dwell time could be several seconds or minutes.

Fragmentation or Pellet Weapons. The former Soviet Union operated an
antisatellite weapon using fragmentation pellets that could attack satellites in low-
Earth orbit [U.S. Congress, OTA, 1985]. This weapon, launched from ground
locations, achieved an orbit with nearly the same elements as those of the target satel-
lite. Hence we call it a co-orbital antisatellite system. Radar or optical guidance brings
the weapon close to the target satellite. A high explosive then creates many small
fragments which move rapidly toward the target satellite and damage or kill it by
impact.

High-Power Microwave Weapons. These weapons generate a beam of RF energy
intense enough to damage or interfere with a satellite’s electronic systems. Their fre-
quencies of operations range from 1 to 90 GHz, thereby covering the commonly used
frequencies for command, communication, telemetry, and control of most modern
satellites. A satellite’s antenna tuned to receive a frequency the weapons radiate will
amplify the received radiation. Thus, it could damage RF amplifiers, downconverters,
or other devices in the front end of a receiver.

Neutral-Particle-Beam Weapons. Particle accelerators have been used for high-
energy nuclear physics research since the early 1930s, so the technology is well
developed. Weapons using this technology must be based in space because the
particles cannot penetrate the atmosphere. The particles would be accelerated as neg-
ative hydrogen or deuterium ions, then neutralized by stripping an electron as they
emerge from the accelerator. (The particles must be electrically neutral to avoid being
deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field).

8.2.3 Spacecraft Hardening

Hardening of a space system’s elements is the single most effective action we can
take to make it more survivable. Presently, we use hardening to prevent electronics
upset or damage from nuclear-weapon effects. In the 2000s, we will see laser harden-
ing in military satellites which must survive hostile attacks. If projected antisatellite
weapons are developed and deployed, hardening will help reduce the effects of High-
Power Microwave and Neutral-Particle-Beam weapons on satellites.

Figure 8-16 gives approximate upper and lower bounds on the weight required to
harden a satellite to nuclear weapons effects. The technology for hardening satellites
against nuclear weapons is well developed up to a few tenths of cal/cm?. Above these
levels, the hardening weight increases sharply, as Fig. 8-16 illustrates. Figure 8-17
gives rough upper and lower bounds on hardening costs. Comparable cost data may be
found in Webb and Kweder [1998].

For X-rays with photon energy below 3 keV, shielding is very effective with almost
any convenient material, such as aluminum. At higher photon energies, materials with
higher atomic numbers, Z, are more effective than the low-Z materials. A commonly
used shielding material is tantalum because of its availability and ease of manufacture.
A satellite’s external surfaces are particularly vulnerable to crazing, cracking, delam-
ination, or micro-melting. Therefore, we must carefully select materials for these
surfaces to protect functions such as thermal control, optical transmission, or reflec-
tion. In this category are covers for solar cells, optical coatings on lenses and thermal
contro] mirrors, thermal control paints, metal platings, and optical elements made of
quartz or glass. The data for typical satellite materials exposed in underground nuclear
tests is, in general, classified.

Prompt dose results from penetrating X-radiation and, to a lesser extent, from
prompt gamma. Typically, the X-ray prompt dose is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude larger
than the dose from prompt gamma. At typical spacecraft levels, prompt dose can break
the bonds of the leads on susceptible integrated circuits and can cause electronic
circuits to experience burnout, latchup, and temporary upset.

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 231

In most cases, shielding of the X-radiation can reduce the internal dose to manage-
able levels. Figure 8-18 gives the prompt dose in silicon shielded by the basic
0.040-inch aluminum enclosure plus a range of additional tantalum shielding in g/cm2.
We can use this figure to estimate the extra tantalum weight required to shield against
the prompt dose. The procedure is as follows:

Fig. 8-18. Prompt Dose as a Function of Additional Tantalum Shielding (Worst Case
1-15 keV Spectrum).

¢ Using Fig. 8-18, scale the maximum allowable prompt dose by the fluence
appropriate to the system under consideration and determine the surface mass
density (g/cm?) required;

* Multiply the surface mass density required by the total area to be shielded on
the satellite.

The total dose is the sum of the ionizing dose from all sources of radiation and is
usually expressed in rads (Si). In almost all cases, the total dose is dominated by
trapped electrons in the geomagnetic field. Figure 8-19 gives the dose in silicon as a
function of thickness of shielding material in g/cm, normalized to an incident 1 MeV
electron fluence of 10!4 electrons/cm2. The asymptotic nature of the dose curve for
large mass densities results from the bremsstrahlung electrons produce as they stop in
the shielding material. Thus, we would shield interactively for total dose and prompt
dose. The prompt dose shielding also attenuates the radiation from the Van Allen belts,
and the extra aluminum needed to attenuate the Van Allen belt radiation also
attenuates the prompt X-radiation. For example, as Fig. 8-18 shows, an aluminum box
0.102 cm thick can reduce an external prompt dose of 3 x 108 rads (Si): cal“! - cm? to
an internal dose of 4 x 105 rads (Si)- cal-!- cm2, We can reduce the prompt dose even
further by adding more high-Z material, such as tantalum or tungsten as shown in
Fig. 8-18. This high-Z material also reduces the dose caused by trapped electrons, as
mentioned above.

Metals are relatively unaffected by total dose. However, total dose degrades certain
properties of organic materials, beginning between 0.1 and 1 Mrad, and makes them
unusable above 10 to 30 Mrad. For example, organic materials may soften, become
brittle, or lose tensile strength. NASA [1980] and Bolt and Carroll [1963] give data on
how the total dose affects organic materials. Figure 8-20 shows the “sure-safe” total
dose capabilities for commonly used satellite materials.

Silicon electronic devices suffer decreases in operating parameters such as gain,
gate voltage, or lifetime of the minority carrier. We can measure these operating
parameter changes as a function of dose and develop curves of radiation deratings.
Thus, during circuit design, these radiation deratings are used to ensure that the
devices will continue to operate satisfactorily at the design exposure level.

Total dose also includes the ionization from prompt and delayed weapon radiation,
as well as neutron-generated radiation. To the total dose from man-made sources of
hostile radiation, we must add radiation from the natural environments. The total dose
depends on the amount of shielding, orbital parameters, and satellite life. In the
absence of nuclear-weapon detonations, the total dose will normally increase linearly
with time on orbit. To harden a satellite against these effects, we would use silicon-
based electronic devices which tolerate the effects and shield them to the appropriate
level, depending on how long we want the satellite to last. In the future, we will
increase the use of electronic devices based on gallium arsenide, because gallium
arsenide appears to be unusually immune to total dose effects.

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 233

Radiation hardened parts are required for all designs that must operate in nuclear
weapon environments, but some commercial communications satellites can consider
using radiation tolerant parts (<50 krads capability) or even commercial off the shelf
(COTS) Class B type parts (10-15 krads capability), particularly if they will only
operate in low-Earth orbits (less than about 1,000 km) and have orbital design
lifetimes of 2 to 3 years maximum. Table 8-7 shows a comparison of typical unhard-
ened COTS parts and hardened parts capabilities.

TABLE 8-7. COTS and Rad Hard Parts Comparison. Rad hardening increases radiation
protection significantly, thus increasing spacecraft survivability.

¢ Higher margins and more testing (screening) are required with COTS usage, which will offset lower piece part costs.
¢ LET is Linear Energy Transfer threshold.

Whether designing satellite electronics with RAD Hard or COTS parts, a Radiation
Hardness Assurance Control Plan (RHACP) is necessary to specify radiation design
requirements, parts derating methods, required design margins, parts testing require-
ments and the process for controlling all activities related to radiation hardness. Imple-
mentation of the RHACP will help ensure the success of the hardness design and
hardness verification process. The hardware is normally hardness qualified at an
appropriate level, either piece part, unit, subsystem or system, whichever is economi-
cally and technically correct.

Displacement fluence is any electromagnetic or particulate radiation which dis-
places atoms from their normal lattice positions. For nuclear weapons, neutron fluence
is the primary cause of displacement. In the natural environment, electrons and protons
are the principal contributors. The displaced atoms and their vacancies will react with
the bulk material and form stable defects in the lattice structure. These defects
significantly change the equilibrium-carrier concentration and minority-carrier life-
time. In silicon solar cells, these changes degrade power output. In other solid-state
electronic devices, they reduce gain and increase forward voltage drop and reverse
leakage currents.

We cannot harden to the neutron displacement fluence from a nuclear burst by
shielding because the uncharged neutron is very penetrating and large amounts of
shielding would be needed. In general, we harden to the neutron fluence by selecting
devices that resist degradation by neutrons.

To protect against displacement by electrons or protons, we must shield the solid-
state devices. Solar cells are shielded by a layer of fused silica, varying in thickness
with the amount of shielding required. At very high ionization dose, the cover glass
material darkens, reducing the solar array’s power output. For solid-state devices

234 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

contained inside aluminum boxes, we choose the thickness of the aluminum to stop the
electrons and ignore the protons, which penetrate much less in most commonly used
orbits.

Delayed beta radiation flux can also be shielded effectively in the same manner as
total dose, since it is composed of electrons. In contrast, delayed gamma flux cannot
be shielded easily due to its high energy content (up to about 12 MeV). As an example,
a factor of 10 reduction requires about 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) of high Z material like tung-
sten or tantalum. Mitigation of gamma debris noise spikes in sensor systems will
require heavy shielding and/or pulse suppression signal processing (such as time delay
integration), or even complementary satellite tasking. Even then, the gamma noise can
still be high enough to cause sensor outages lasting from seconds to minutes, depend-
ing on specific sensor performance characteristics and design. For example, a fairly
robust sensor with an operational capability (noise threshold plus signal to noise ratio)
of 10° photons/cm?2 /s will be “blind” for about 34 sec, given a 1 megaton burst at
100 km away from the satellite, using Eq. (8-12).

EMP is typically in the MHz range. At satellite altitudes, EMP intensities of a few
V/m can easily cause damage and upset in unhardened satellites. To prevent this, Fara-
day shields can keep the radiation from entering the satellite cavities. We can also use
good external grounding, interconnect all conducting parts and surfaces, employ surge
arrestors, and eliminate sensitive components. In addition, designing for electromag-
netic compatibility, such as shielding of cables and harnesses, will reduce or eliminate
much of the potential for EMP damage. Computers are particularly sensitive to EMP,
as are the following components (in order of decreasing sensitivity): semiconductor
diodes in microwave applications, field-effect transistors, RF transistors, silicon-
controlled rectifiers, audio transistors and semiconductor diodes in power rectifier
applications.

SGEMP occurs when the incident flux of photons, both X-ray and gamma ray,
creates a flux of electrons inside the satellite. Some of the energetic electrons are not
stopped in solid material but emerge into satellite cavities, causing currents and fields
within these cavities. At representative satellite fluence levels, these electrons can gen-
erate cable injection currents of 10-100 amperes/meter of cable length and peak cavity
electric fields of several hundred kilovolts/meter. The fields then couple electromag-
netic energy into cables and other conductive elements in the cavity, and the sharp
pulse of energy transmitted to sensitive components can make them fail.

SGEMP hardening uses the same methods as EMP hardening except for external
shielding, because SGEMP generates inside the satellite. We can also treat internal
surfaces with low-Z (atomic number) paints to reduce electron emission into cavities.
Using specially designed low-response cables will also reduce SGEMP effects.
Finally, we can protect input/output circuits and terminals with various devices—
zener diodes, low-pass filters, and bandpass filters—to limit current or to clamp
voltage.

The natural space phenomena causing single event upsets (SEUs) and other single-
event effects (SEEs), as well as methods for predicting upset rates, were addressed in
Sec. 8.1.5. Because shielding is ineffective in reducing SEEs, satellite systems must
be designed to mitigate these effects, given that they will occur. Table 8-8 lists some
classical approaches used in modern space system design. The extent to which these
approaches are applied depends on the mission criticality, system upset specifications
(allowable rates and outage times), and orbital environment expected. However, as
indicated in the table, selection of acceptable parts is perhaps the single most important

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 235

of all approaches for SEE mitigation, albeit not sufficient by itself. Not indicated in
Table 8-8 is the effect of orbital altitude. While geosynchronous altitude is the worst
case for SEEs (due to galactic cosmic rays), orbits that traverse the proton belt (ellip-
tical orbits and those between about 1,200 km and 8,000 km altitude) will have SEEs
from high energy protons, in addition to galactic cosmic rays, and the proton SEUs can
be 10 times worse.

better parts, improved shielding, and process redundancy.

Surface charging and resultant electrostatic discharge (ESD) due to space plasmas
were addressed briefly in Sec 8.1.4, including basic design guidelines for satellite
survivability. Satellites that are highly exposed to electrons (those at high altitudes,
geosynchronous and highly elliptical orbits) must also be designed to survive bulk
charging, in which electrons embedded in bulk dielectrics (cable dielectrics and circuit
boards) and isolated conductors (such as ungrounded circuit board metallizations and
spot shields on parts) build up potentials sufficient to cause discharges. Such dis-
charges can result in anomalous upset and/or damage to electronics, much like SEUs,
discussed in the preceding paragraph.

Much of the work on bulk charging is summarized by Vampola [1996], based on
CRRES flight data. Mitigation approaches are indicated in Table 8-9. Designers can
eliminate most bulk charging concerns simply by providing sufficient shielding to
reduce both maximum current on circuit boards to less than 0.1 x 10-!? amps/cm? and
maximum total integrated fluence to less than 3 x 10° electrons/em? on ungrounded
localized spot shields [Frederickson et al., 1992]. For geosynchronous satellites, this
shielding is about 0.305 cm of total equivalent aluminum (which is typically provided
for total dose protection).

8.2.4 Strategies for Achieving Survivability

As described in Sec. 8.2.3 and summarized in Table 8-10, hardening is the single
most effective survivability option. Table 8-11 presents other strategies for enhancing
survivability. We use redundant nodes, also called proliferation or multiple satellites,
to overlap satellite coverages. Thus, if one satellite fails, others will perform at least a
part of the total mission. An attacker must use multiple attacks to defeat the space sys-
tem-—a costly and therefore more difficult approach for the enemy. The development
of the so-called lightsat technology—tight, inexpensive satellites performing limited
functions—will support this strategy. To be effective, each node (ground station or
satellite) must be separated from another node by a large enough distance to prevent a
single attack from killing more than one node.

ment is harsh, survivability can be designed into spacecraft subsystems.

8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 237

Prior to the end of the Cold War, fixed ground control stations were high priority
targets of ICBM-launched nuclear weapons. Therefore, satellites needed to be auton-
omous or capable of being controlled by multiple mobile ground control stations, or
utilize a combination of the two survivability features. In the Post-Cold War era, these
survivability features are less important. Nevertheless, the following principles of
survivability are still relevant. Mobile ground stations are survivable because ICBMs
cannot find targets whose Earth coordinates are unknown and continually changing.
By deploying mobile ground stations so they are separate from one another, we allow
a single nuclear weapon to kill, at most, one ground station.

238 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2

Onboard systems for attack reporting tell ground-control stations that a satellite is
being attacked and what the attack parameters are. Without such information, ground
operators may assume a spacecraft fault or natural accident has occurred, rather than
an attack. Thus, controllers could act incorrectly or fail to act when necessary. More
importantly, national command authorities need timely information telling of any
attack on our space assets.

Decoys are an inexpensive way to blunt an antisatellite attack. They simulate the
satellite’s optical or RF signature and deploy at the appropriate moment, thus diverting
the attack toward the decoys. Decoys must be credible (provide a believable radar or
optical simulation of the satellite) and must properly sense an attack to know the
precise moment for the most effective deployment. We can also defeat a homing anti-
satellite by including optical or RF jammers to nullify or confuse its homing system.
Such jammers weigh little and, depending on how well we know the parameters of the
homing system, can be very effective.

A satellite can maneuver, or dodge, an antisatellite attack if it has thrusters for that
purpose. Of course, almost every satellite has thrusters for attitude control and orbit
changes. Thrusters for maneuvers are more powerful, generating higher accelerations
and causing the need for stiffer, stronger solar arrays or other appendages. These extra
requirements lead to weight penalties. In addition, we must supply more propellant,
trading off the increased propellant weight against the increased survivability.

A satellite can defend itself against an antisatellite attack if that capability is
included in the design. One possible approach is to include a suite of optical or radar
sensors and small, lightweight missiles. The sensors would detect the onset of an
attack, determine approximate location and velocity of the attacker, and launch the
self-guided, homing missiles to kill the attacker. Of course, we would have to consider
weight, power, inertial properties, and other design factors, but a self-defense system
is a reasonable way to help a high-value spacecraft survive. Alternatively, we could
deploy an escort satellite carrying many more missiles and being much more able to
detect, track, and intercept the antisatellite attack. An escort satellite would cost more
than active defense on the primary satellite, but the latter’s weight and space limita-
tions may demand it.
