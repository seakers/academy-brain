ine 1unuamentai pnysicai constants and conversions factors based on them are
those determined by the National Bureau of Standards using a least squares fit to the
best available experimental data [Cohen, 1986]. Their intent is to create a set of
constants which are mutually consistent to within the experimental accuracy. Other
constants and conversion factors, such as the speed of light in vacuum or the conver-
sion between feet and meters, are adopted as exact definitions of the units involved.
For astronomical and astronautical constants, such as the values of GM for various
objects in the solar system, values adopted by the International Astronomical Union
are used. Many of these are quoted from Astrophysical Quantities [Cox, 1999], which
kindly permitted use of proof copies for obtaining the most current data. We highly
recommend this volume for those who need additional quantitative detail about the
solar system or other astronomical topics.

Mass Distribution for Selected Satellites

Table A-1 lists representative satellite masses with and without propellant for
various types of spacecraft. Table A—2 further breaks down the dry mass by the
percentage devoted to each subsystem. See Table 18-2 for definitions of the mass cat-
egories and Table 10-2 for definitions of the various subsystems. Statistical data for
the various classes of missions are also provided. Table A—-2 also includes subsystem
masses as a percentage of the payload mass, since this may be the only mass known
during early mission design.

The data here can be used as either a preliminary estimate or check on the reason-
ableness of more detailed methods (see Chaps. 10 and 11 for other methods). How-
ever, such historical data should always be used with caution and substantial margin
should be applied. The first three categories are more traditional, older DoD space-
craft. The LightSats are newer, typically much less expensive systems from many
developers, both US and international. As the satellite microminiaturization process
continues, individual components will get smaller and percentages will shift, depend-
ing on both the component mix and the mission needs.

The average values and the associated standard deviation for each of the spacecraft
subsystems are also listed in Table A-2. The final row lists the percentage of the pay-

useful in the beginning of a program when we only know the mass of the payload.
When using these estimates, be sure to apply an appropriate margin for error (See
Chap. 10).

Geocentric and Geodetic Coordinates on the Earth

As shown in Fig. B-1, geocentric coordinates are defined with respect to the center
of the Earth. However, latitude and longitude are frequently given in geodetic coordi-
nates which are defined with respect to an oblate reference ellipsoid (i.e., a figure
created by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis), with the height, 4, measured per-
pendicular to a plane tangent to the ellipsoid. A triaxial ellipsoid is not generally used
since the gain in representation is smal]. Although not normally used for space mission
work, astronomical latitude and longitude are defined relative to the local vertical, or
the normal to the equipotential surface of the Earth. Thus, astronomical latitude is
defined as the angle between the local vertical and the Earth’s equatorial plane. Max-
imum values of the deviation of the vertical, or the angle between the local vertical and
the normal to a reference ellipsoid, are about 1 minute of arc. Maximum variations in
the height between the ellipsoid and mean sea level (also called the equipotential
surface) are about 100 m. Seidelmann [1992] provides an extended discussion of
coordinate systems and transformations.

900 Appendix B

The geocentric latitude, 0’, of a point, p, on the surface of the Earth is the angle at
the Earth’s center between p and the equatorial plane. The geodetic or geographic lat-
itude, @, is the angle between the normal to the reference ellipsoid (at point p’) and the
equatorial plane. The ellipsoid is typically defined by the flattening, f, or the inverse
flattening, \/f, given by

a-b
a

f=

where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipsoid.

The geocentric longitude, A, is defined by the angle between the reference (or zero)
meridian and the meridian of point p (and p’), measured eastward around the Earth
from 0° to 360°. The geodetic longitude will be identical to the geocentric longitude
assuming that the reference ellipsoid has the same axes and reference meridian as the
geocentric system.

The ellipsoidal height, h, of point p is measured along the normal to the ellipse, and
with respect to the point of intersection of that normal with the ellipsoidal surface, that
is, from point p’. Other ‘heights’ are possible—for example, the geocentric radius, r,
and the height above mean sea level or geoidal height, H.

We often express the position of a point, p, on or near the Earth in a right-handed
geocentric cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z). Here the direction of the Z-axis is
that of the rotational reference ellipsoid, the X-axis is perpendicular to Z through the
reference meridian. The Y-axis completes the triplet in a right-handed sense.

Conversion from geocentric to geocentric cartesian coordinates is given by

Note that # = sin“! (Z/r) may also be used to determine ¢", and that these functions
are evaluated such that -90° <# <+90°, and 0° <A <360°.

To convert from geocentric cartesian to geodetic coordinates is not as simple a pro-
cedure. An exact solution has been given by Borkowski [1989] based on using an
expression for the reduced latitude in a solvable fourth-degree polynomial.

We first calculate intermediate variables as follows:

R=VX?+Y? Q =2(E? - F’)
F =[bZ + (a? -b*)|/aR v=(D-0)" -(p+9)"

P=4(EF +1)/3 o=4[ Jey +e]

|”

t=[G? +(F-vG)/(2G-E)] -G

Finally, the latitude and ellipsoidal height are computed from:

o=tan™(a(1-17)/ (201)}
h =(R-at)cos@+(Z— b)sing (B-8)

To obtain the correct sign, set the sign of b to that of Z before beginning. This
solution is singular for points at the Z-axis (r = 0) or in the XY-plane. For which:

ry ee g=9'=0

h=Z~-b Fag [AY plane

(B-9)
Additionally, for points close to these conditions, some round-off error may be
avoided and the accuracy improved slightly be replacing the value of v with

v=v?+2Q/3P (near Z axis or XY plane) (B-10)

Finally,

A= tan '(Y /X) (B-11)

Appendix D

Spherical Geometry

D.1 General Formulas

This appendix provides a summary of basic rules. More detailed discussions are
provided by Green [1985], Smart [1977], and Newcomb [1960]. Wertz [2001] pro-
vides a detailed discussion of global geometry and its application to problems of space
mission analysis, including a discussion of “full-sky” techniques that eliminate the
quadrant ambiguities which make automated spherical geometry solutions complex
and inconvenient.

A right spherical triangle is one with at least one right angle. (Unlike plane trian-
gles, spherical triangles can have 1, 2, or 3 right angles.) Any two of the remaining
components, including the two remaining angles, serve to completely define the trian-
gle. Napier’s Rules, given in any of the above books, provide a concise formulation
for all possible right spherical triangles. However, experience has shown that it is
substantially more convenient to write out explicitly the rules for the relatively small
number of possible combinations of known and unknown sides and angles. These are
listed in Table D-1.

A quadrantal spherical triangle is one with at least one side which is 90 deg in
length. As with right spherical triangles, any two of the remaining five components
completely define the triangle. These are given by a corresponding set of Napier’s
Rules. Again, it is more practical to write out explicitly all possible relationships.
These are given in Table D-2.

An oblique spherical triangle has arbitrary sides and angles. Sides and angles are
generally defined over the range of 0 to 180 deg, although most of the spherical geom-
etry relations continue to hold in the angular range up to 360 deg. A set of basic rules
which can be applied to any spherical triangle are given in Table D-3. Finally, these
general rules can be used to write explicit expressions for any of the unknown compo-
nents in any oblique spherical triangle with any three components known. These are
given in full by Wertz [2001].

D.2 Thermal Geometry*

As discussed in Sec. 11.5, thermal calculations are made more complex by both the
IR and albedo radiation from the Earth or other nearby planet. Because the planet fills
a large area of the sky from low orbit, the calculation of geometrical factors is complex
and not amenable to simple approximations. Consequently, the thermal IR and albedo

inputs are both adjusted by thermal geometry factors, Fp and F yypedg, which are listed
for a common range of spacecraft altitudes and attitudes in the tables below. Compu-
tation of the values needed for the table look-up are described here and the application
of the geometry factors is described in Sec. 11.5.

The tables are applicable to a flat plate, with normal vector, N, in the vicinity of a
planetary body. The whole spacecraft can then be approximated as a series of flat
plates, with the geometry for each surface computed independently. (See Examples 1,
2, and 3 in Sec. 5.1 for computation of eclipses, Sun angle geometry, and orbit average
solar thermal input on a flat plate.) The thermal IR radiation from the Earth is modeled
only as a function of 7, the nadir angle between N and the center of the Earth and H,
the altitude of the spacecraft above the surface of the Earth. The albedo geometry
factor is a function of 7, H, 82, and @. As shown in Fig. D-1, @ is the rotation angle
about the nadir vector from the Sun to N. (Because it is a rotation angle, it is the same
angle whether measured on the spacecraft or on the Earth’s surface.) 0 is the Earth
central angle from the Sun to the spacecraft which, to the accuracy of the thermal
computations, is equal to 180 deg minus the angle at the spacecraft from the Sun to
nadir.

See text for discussion.

For an Earth-oriented spacecraft, the nadir angle, 7, is known or can be computed by
any of the methods in Secs. 5.1 and 5.2. The Earth central angle from the Sun to the
spacecraft, 0, is given by:

cos (180 deg — &) = -cos 0 = cos Azg,,, cos Bs (D-1)
where AzZg,,, is the azimuth of the Sun relative to nadir and Bs, often called the “B
angle,” is the angle of the Sun out of the orbit plane. The rotation angle Q is then given
by:
cos By +cos@cosn
sin@sinn (D-2)

cos Q =

where fy is the angle from the Sun to the normal, N, to the plate in question. (See
Sec. 5.1.)

Spherical Geometry 909

For planets other than the Earth, the same geometry factors can be used with the
planetary albedo and thermal IR characteristics from Table 11-46. The altitudes listed
in Table D-1 should be interpreted as the altitudes proportional to the planetary radius.
Thus, in Table D-1, the data for 500 km altitude corresponds to 0.0784 Rg, where Rg
is the Earth’s equatorial radius of 6,378.14 km. For Mars with an equatorial radius of
3,397 km, the data for 500 km in Table D-1 corresponds to an altitude above Mars of
3397 x 0.0784 = 266 km.

Appendix E
Universal Time and Julian Dates

James R. Wertz, Microcosm, Inc.

Calendar time in the usual form of date and time is used only for input and output
because arithmetic is cumbersome in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Nonetheless, this is used for most human interaction with space systems because it’s
the system with which we are most familiar. Even with date and time systems,
problems can arise, because time zones are different throughout the world and
spacecraft operations typically involve a worldwide network. The uniformly adopted
solution to this problem is to use the local standard time corresponding to 0 deg
longitude (i.e., the Greenwich meridian) as the assigned time for events anywhere in
the world or in space. This is referred to as Universal Time (UT), Greenwich Mean
Time (GMT), or Zulu (Z), all of which are equivalent for most practical spacecraft
operations. The name Greenwich Mean Time is used because 0 deg longitude is
defined by the site of the former Royal Greenwich Observatory in metropolitan
London.

Civil time, T,;,;, as measured by a standard wall clock or time signals, differs from
Universal Time by an integral number of hours, corresponding approximately to the
longitude of the observer. The approximate relation is:

Teivil = UT+(L+ 7.515 (E-1)

where T,.;,;; and UT are in hours, and L is the longitude in degrees with the plus sign
corresponding to East longitude and the minus sign corresponding to West longitude.
The conversion between civil time and Universal Time for most North American and
European time zones is given in Table E-1. Substantial variations in time zones are
created for political convenience. In addition, most of the United States and Canada
observe Daylight Savings Time from the first Sunday in April until the last Sunday in
October. Most European countries observe daylight savings time (called “summer
time’) from the last Sunday in March to the first Sunday in October. Many countries
in the southern hemisphere also maintain daylight savings time, typically from
October to March. Countries near the equator typically do not deviate from standard
time.

Calendar time is remarkably inconvenient for computation, particularly over long
time intervals of months or years. We need an absolute time that is a continuous count
of time units from some arbitrary reference. The time interval between any two events
may then be found by simply subtracting the absolute time of the second event from
that of the first. The universally adopted solution for astronomical problems is the
Julian Day, JD, a continuous count of the number of days since Greenwich noon
(12:00 UT) on January 1, 4713 BC", or, as astronomers now say, -4712. Because
Julian Days start at noon UT, they will be a half day off with respect to civil dates.
While this is inconvenient for transforming from civil dates to Julian dates, it was
useful for astronomers because the date didn't change in the middle of the night (for
European observers).

As described below, there are four general approaches for converting between cal-
endar dates and Julian dates.

Table Look-Up

Tabulations of the current Julian Date are in most astronomical ephemerides and
almanacs. Table E-2 lists the Julian Dates at the beginning of each year from 1990
through 2031. To find the Julian Date for any given calendar date, simply add the day
number within the year (and fractional day number, if appropriate) to the Julian Date
for Jan 0.0 of that year from Table E-2. Day numbers for each day of the year are on
many calendars or can be found by adding the date to the day number for day 0 of the
month from Table E-3. Thus 18:00 UT on April 15, 2002 = day number 15.75 +90 =
105.75 in 2002 = JD 105.75 + 2,452,274.5 = JD 2,452,380.25.

To convert from Julian Days to dates, determine the year in which the Julian Date
falls from Table E-2. Subtract the Julian Date from the JD for January 0.0 of that year
to determine the day number within the year. This can be converted to a date (and time,
if appropriate) by using day numbers on a calendar or subtracting from the day number
for the beginning of the appropriate month from Table E-3. Thus, from Table E-2,
JD 2,451,608.25 is in the year 2000. The day number is 2,451,608.25 — 2,451,543.5 =
64.75. From Table E-3, this is 18:00 UT, March 4, 2000.

Software Routines Using Integer Arithmetic
A particularly clever procedure for finding the Julian Date, JD, associated with any
current year, Y, month, M, and day of the month, D, is given by Fliegel and Van

* This strange starting point was suggested by an Italian scholar of Greek and Hebrew, Joseph
Scaliger, in 1582 as the beginning of the current Julian period of 7,980 years. This period is
the product of three numbers: the solar cycle, or the interval at which all dates recur on the
same days of the week (28 years); the lunar cycle, containing an integral number of lunar
months (19 years); and the indiction or the tax period introduced by the Emperor Constantine
in 313 AD (1S years). The last time that these started together was 4713 BC and the next time
will be 3267 AD. Scaliger was interested in reducing the astronomical dating problems asso-
ciated with calendar reforms of his time and his proposal had the convenient selling point that
it pre-dated the ecclesiastically approved date of creation, October 4, 4004 BC.

Universal Time and Julian Dates 915

TABLE E-2. Julian Date at the Beginning of Each Year from 1990 to 2031. See text for
explanation of use. The day number for the beginning of the year is called “Jan.
0.0” (actually Dec. 31st of the preceding year) so that day numbers can be found
by simply using dates. Thus, Jan. 1 is day number 1 and has a JD 1 greater than
that for Jan.0. * =leap year.

Flandern [1968] as a computer statement using integer arithmetic. Note that all of the
variables must be defined as integers (i.e., any remainder after a division must be
truncated) and that both the order of the computations and the parentheses are critical.
This procedure works in FORTRAN, C, C++, and Ada for any date on the Gregorian
calendar that yields JD > 0. (Add 10 days to the JD for dates on the Julian calendar
prior to 1582.)

JD = D — 32,075 + 1461 x (Y + 4800 + (M — 14)/12)/4
+ 367 x (M—2—(M - 14)/12 x 12)/12
-3 x ((Y + 4900 + (M — 14) / 12) / 100) /4 (E-2a)

Here JDg is the Julian Day beginning at noon UT on the given date and must be an
integer. For a fractional day, F, in UT (i.e., day number D.F), the floating point Julian
Day is given by:

JD =JDg+F-0.5 (E-2b)
For example, the Julian Day beginning at 12:00 UT on December 25, 2007 (Y = 2007,
M = 12, D=25) is JD 2,454,460 and 6:00 UT on that date (F = 0.25) is JD

2,454,459.75.
The inverse routine for computing the date from the Julian Day is given by:

L = JDp + 68,569 (E-3a)
N = (4xL)/ 146,097 (E-3b)
L=L-(146097 x N+3)/4 (E-3c)
I = (4000 x (L + 1))/ 1,461,001 (E-3d)
L=L-(1461x1)/4+31 (E-3e)
J=(80xL)/ 2,447 (E-3f)
D=L- (2447 x J)/80 (E-3g)
L=J/1 (E-3h)
M=J+2-12xL (E-3i)
Y = 100x(N-49)+1+L (E-3))

where integer arithmetic is used throughout. Y, M, and D are the year, month, and day,
and I, J, L, and N are intermediate variables. Finally, again using integer arithmetic,
the day of the week, W, corresponding to the Julian Date beginning at 12:00 on that
day is given by:

W=JD9-7X (JD+ 1)/7)+2 (E-4)
where W = | corresponds to Sunday. Thus, December 25, 2007 falls on Tuesday.

Software Routines Without Integer Arithmetic

While most computer languages provide integer arithmetic, spreadsheets such as
Excel or MatLab typically do not. (See below for use of Excel and MatLab DATE
functions.) Similar capabilities are available using integer (INT) or truncation
(TRUNC in Excel, FIX in MatLab) functions. INT and TRUNC are identical for
positive numbers, but differ for negative numbers: INT(-3.1) = -4, whereas
TRUNC(-3.1) = -3. It is the TRUNC or FIX function which is equivalent to integer

Universal Time and Julian Dates 917

arithmetic. Thus, using the same variables as above, we can rewrite Eqs. (E-2) for
computation of JD from the date as:

C = TRUNC((M — 14)/12) (E-5a)

JDp = D — 32,075 + TRUNC(1,461 x (Y + 4,800 + C)/4)
+ TRUNC(367 x (M —2 —C x 12/12)
~TRUNC(3 x (TRUNC(Y + 4,900 + C) / 100) /4) (E-5b)

JD =JD9+F-05 (E-5c)

where again JDo, Y, M, D, and C are integers and F and JD are real numbers. Applying
the same rules to Eq. (E-3) gives the inverse formula for the date in terms of JD as:

L=JD + 68,569 (E-6a)
N = TRUNC((4 x L) / 146,097) (E-6b)
L=L-—TRUNC((146097 x N + 3) / 4) (E-6c)
I = TRUNC((4000 x (L + 1)) / 1,461,001) (E-6d)
L=L-TRUNC((1,461 x I) / 4) +31 (E-6e)
J = TRUNC((80 x L) / 2,447) (E-6f)
D = L—TRUNC((2,447 x J) / 80) (E-6g)
L=TRUNC(J/ 11) (E-6h)
M=J+2-12xL (E-6i)
Y = 100x(N~49)+1+L (E-6j)

where the variables are the same as Eq. (E-3), except that D is now a real number cor-
responding to the date and fraction of a day. Finally, Eq. (E-4) for the day of the week
becomes:

W=JD-—7x TRUNC ((JD + 1.5)/7) +25
=JD-—7xINT((JD + 1.5)/7) +25 (E-7)

where 1 < W < 2 corresponds to Sunday. The examples given above can also serve as
test cases for Eqs. (E-5), (E-6), and (E-7).

Modified Julian Date

The Julian Date presents minor problems for space applications. Because it was
introduced principally for astronomical use, Julian Dates begin at 12:00 UT rather than
0 hours UT, as the civil calendar does (thus the 0.5 day differences in Table E-2). In
addition, the 7 digits required for the Julian Date did not permit the use of single
precision arithmetic in older computer programs. This is no longer a problem with
modern computer storage and number formats. Nonetheless, various forms of trun-
cated Julian dates have gained at least some use.

The most common of the truncated Julian dates for astronomical and astronautics
use is the Modified Julian Date, MJD, given by:

MJD = JD — 2,400,000.5 (E-8)

MJD begins at midnight, to correspond with the civil calendar. Thus, in using
Table E-2, the MJD is given by adding the day of the year (plus fractions of a day, if

918 Appendix E

appropriate) to the number in the table, with the “5” at the end of the table-listing
dropped. For example, the MJD for 18:00 UT on Jan. 3, 2002 = MJD 52,277.75. The
definition of the MJD given here is that adopted by the International Astronomical
Union in 1997. Note, however, that other definitions of the MJD have been used. Thus,
the most unambiguous approach remains the use of the full Julian Date.

Spreadsheets such as Excel or MatLab

Spreadsheets, such as Excel or MatLab, typically store dates internally as some
form of day count and allow arithmetic operations, such as subtraction. Thus, we can
either subtract two dates directly to determine a time interval or convert them to Julian
Dates by simply finding the additive constant, K, given by:

K=JD-I (E-9)

where I is the internal number representing a known date, JD. Once this is determined,
then the JD for any date is:

ID=K+I (E-10)

Many versions of Excel use Jan. 1, 1904, as “day 0,” such that Kp,., = 2,416,480.5.
However, this should be checked for individual programs because other starting points
are sometimes used and the starting point is a variable parameter in some versions of
Excel. While this can be a very convenient function, Excel date routines run only from
1904 to 2078.

MatLab typically uses Jan. 1, 0000, 0:0:0 as ‘“‘day 0.” Thus, in the formula above,

Any of the day counting approaches will work successfully over its allowed range.
However, systems intended for general mathematics or business use may not account
correctly for leap years and calendar changes when historical times or times far in the
future are being evaluated. Thus, the use of the full Julian Date remains the most
unambiguous solution, particularly if a program or result is to be used by more than
one person or program. For a more extended discussion of time systems, see for exam-
ple, Seidelmann [1992] or Wertz [2001].

Units and Conversion Factors

Robert Bell, Microcosm, Inc.

The metric system of units, officially known as the International System of Units,
or SI, is used throughout this book, with the exception that angular measurements are
usually expressed in degrees rather than the SI unit of radians. By international agree-
ment, the fundamental SI units of length, mass, and time are defined as follows (see
National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Special Publication 330 [1991)}):

The meter is the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a
time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second.

The kilogram is the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram.

The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation
corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the
ground state of the cesium-133 atom.

Additional base units in the SI system are the ampere for electric current, the kelvin
for thermodynamic temperature, the mole for amount of substance, and the candela for

scientific and technical use.

(1) Care should be taken in transforming magnetic units, because the dimensionality of mag-
netic quantities (B, H, etc.) depends on the system of units. Most of the conversions given
here are between SI and EMU (electromagnetic). The following equations hold in both
sets of units:

ag e 4

mxB= dxH

pH

JA for a current loop in a plane
ym

with the following definitions:

r-™~ 3B me

d=
=

torque

magnetic induction (commonly called “magnetic field”)
magnetic field strength or magnetic intensity

magnetic moment

current loop

vector normal to the plane of the current loop (in the direction of the angular
velocity vector of the current loop about the center of the loop) with magnitude
equal to the area of the loop.

magnetic dipole moment
magnetic permeability

The permeability of vacuum, Ho, has the following values, by definition:
Uo = 1 (dimensionless) EMU
Hg = 4 x 10-7 N/A? SI

Therefore, in electromagnetic units in vacuum, magnetic induction and magnetic field strength
are equivalent and the magnetic moment and magnetic dipole moment are equivalent. For prac-
tical purposes of magnetostatics, space is a vacuum but the spacecraft itself may have 1 # Up.
