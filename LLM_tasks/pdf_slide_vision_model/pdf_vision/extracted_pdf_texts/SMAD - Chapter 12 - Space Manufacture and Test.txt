This chapter presents an overview of the spacecraft manufacturing, assembly, and
test process and the underlying test theory. A system designer must understand this
process because hardware manufacture and test heavily influence the program’s cost
and schedule. In addition, testing technology and special facility requirements may
affect program feasibility. This chapter is oriented principally toward the construction
of a single satellite or the first satellite of a production run. See Sec. 19.1 for a dis-
cussion of the “production line” approach applicable to building satellites in large
numbers such as those which are a part of a large constellation.

Table 12-1 lists the names we use in this chapter to describe the parts of a space-
craft. For example, piece parts are individual parts, including transistors, integrated
circuits, or mechanical parts such as housings, panels, bearings, and gears. A com-
ponent is a complete unit or black box such as a transmitter, receiver, computer, or
electromechanical actuator. Sometimes a functional group of parts, or assembly, is
manufactured or tested together. An assembly as used here may be part of a component
or may be integrated directly into the spacecraft. Subsystems consist of groups of
components. They may be assembled and tested as subsystems or integrated into the
spacecraft as components.

composed of components.

520 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test

Methods for the manufacture and test of spacecraft and spacecraft components
derive from the aircraft and electronics industries. But spacecraft hardware is less
plentiful and less accessible for maintenance. In spacecraft production, a run of 10 is
high volume and spacecraft recalls are extremely rare. Furthermore, environmental
forces severely stress the hardware during launch.

The theory of type test (see Table 12-2) is a basic principle affecting the manu-
facture and test of spacecraft hardware. Type test theory depends on preparing and
controlling complete and exact engineering data (drawings, specifications, and proce-
dures). If the engineering data controls the hardware construction completely, all items
built to the same data are equivalent and the results of any single-item test are valid for
all like items. In particular, if a representative article (type test article) passes a
sequence of qualification tests, all other articles built to the same engineering data
should also pass. In other words, the design is qualified. We simply have to make sure
articles are identical by controlling the engineering data and manufacturing processes.
Less severe acceptance tests then certify proper workmanship.

TABLE 12-2. Theory of Type Testing. The type test theory is the basis for qualification testing.

Engineering data is complete and exact.
Engineering data completely controls manufacture.
All items manufactured to the same engineering data are identical.

Therefore Results of qualification test for one article are valid for all articles.

Table 12-3 lists the steps in manufacturing, integrating, and testing a spacecraft. As
system designers, we must determine how long each step will take and identify any
test or facility requirement that is risky or peculiar to the program. Above all, we
should schedule qualification tests to qualify the spacecraft completely before launch.
The following sections address these steps and describe important aspects of system
design.

12.1 Engineering Data 521

12.1 Engineering Data

Engineering data (see Table 12-4) is drawings, specifications, and procedures.
Standard formats and contents for military contracts are in MIL-STD 100 (drawings)*
and MIL-STD 490 (specifications). Most aerospace companies use similar standards.
Various documents combine to control the hardware manufacture. Each piece part,
assembly, or component is described by its own individual drawing, and drawing call
outs describe materials and processes. Drawing numbers identify parts. In the same
way, drawings control assembly of parts into higher-level assemblies and identify
integration hardware. Drawings also control interfaces, size, shape, and mounting
provisions.

TABLE 12-4. Defining and Controlling Engineering Data.

Engineering Data Drawings, specifications, and procedures
Role of Engineering Produce engineering data

Role of Manufacturing Build hardware to meet engineering data

Role of Quality Control Ensure that the hardware is built and tested to meet
engineering data

Configuration Management Systems and procedures that identify, account for, and
control engineering data

Configuration management is the process of controlling engineering data. It
includes identifying the engineering data required for manufacture (configuration
identification), controlling changes, maintaining the engineering database (configura-
tion control), reviewing and auditing the engineering data (configuration audit), and
verifying that the hardware is built as designed (configuration verification). Changes
to the engineering data (engineering change orders and procedure change orders) are
also tracked. For military contracts, MIL-STD 483, MIL-STD 1521, and DOD-STD
480 itemize configuration-management requirements. Most aerospace contractors
have systems that conform to these standards.

12.2 Manufacture of High-Reliability Hardware

The first step in manufacturing spacecraft hardware is to translate the engineering
data into manufacturing plans, flows, instructions, manufacturing aids, and tooling.
This occurs as the design matures and manufacturing personnel may influence the
design for ease of manufacture. Engineering data is formally released at a Critical
Design Review. Typically, we review manufacturing plans at this time or in a
Manufacturing Readiness Review shortly afterward.

The manufacturing planning starts with subassemblies by generating parts kits,
preparing detailed procedures for assembly, and identifying inspection and test
requirements. We must also identify special facilities (such as clean rooms); manufac-
turing methods, precautions, and controls; and training and certification levels of
personnel. Based on these plans, we then call out the manufacturing steps in detailed
procedures. A copy of the procedures travels with the hardware and is checked off as

* Military specifications and standards are no longer being maintained and are due to be super-
seded by industry standards which are not yet in place.

522 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.2

the steps are completed. This paper becomes part of the permanent record of the
assembly. Inspection and test results are also part of the record, and some installations
include photographs of each assembly.

Manufacturers buy most raw materials from certified vendors, who certify the
material quality. They buy electronic piece parts to meet individual specifications
which call out performance and quality requirements. Under current practices, high-
reliability electronic parts are constructed for a particular program. Such procurement
takes a long time, and most parts undergo extensive testing before combining into
components. Flight hardware usually requires the highest level of reliability, which in
the past has been called S-level. Lower reliability parts may work for prototype and
qualification units not intended for flight. In addition to vendor lead times, each part
order must be bid and negotiated, which adds weeks to the procurement time. The cur-
rent practice is to have the part supplier test each part for performance (group A tests)
and a sample from each lot to extremes (group B and C tests). The manufacturer burns
the parts in while monitoring their performance and does a destructive physical anal-
ysis (DPA test) on a sample.

The industry is currently undergoing a major revision in the way that parts are spec-
ified and procured. In the Department of Defense this is called “Acquisition Reform”
and is characterized by elimination of government specifications and standards for
parts and processes. Industry is expected to replace these specifications and standards
with their own controls or use Professional Society Standards. A consistent set of such
standards is not yet in place although efforts are under way to produce them (see for
instance AIAA Recommended Practice for Parts Management AIAA R-100-1996).
Extensive parts information is also available on the Internet at Air Force and NASA
sites.

To contend with the lead times for parts and materials, manufacturers must order
them before they see component engineering data. Thus, we establish a Project
Approved Parts List (PAPL) and Project Approved Materials List (PAML) early in
the program. Because designers must use the preferred part or identify and justify
new parts, these approved lists reduce the number of part types and allow early
procurement.

Manufacturing facilities cover mechanical manufacturing, electronic manufactur-
ing, spacecraft assembly and test, and special functions. Mechanical manufacturing
includes standard machine shops, plus locations for mechanical assembly, plating and
chemical treatment, composite manufacture, adhesive bonding, and elevated temper-
ature treatment. Although most aerospace facilities are quite clean, mechanical
manufacturing does not normally need controlled cleanliness. But electromechanical
and optical manufacturing, as well as the tailoring of thermal blankets, do need
controlled clean rooms—normally separate from conventional mechanical manufac-
turing. Table 12-5 shows cleanliness requirements for various operations.

Electronic manufacturing facilities include areas for building printed circuits and
clean rooms for building and testing electronic assemblies. Test facilities may include
anechoic chambers and screen rooms containing various types of general-purpose test
equipment as well as special purpose testers for circuit boards and components.
Component tests may also require environmental test facilities.

Spacecraft assembly and test operations are normally conducted in controlled-
cleanliness facilities, which are often high-bay hangars. Spacecraft functional tests are
conducted with special purpose test sets. Spacecraft environmental testing requires
large vibration and thermal-vacuum equipment. ©

12.3 Inspection and Quality Assurance 523

than 10,000 particles per cubic foot.

Many times a spacecraft will need a special facility to protect sensitive equipment
or prevent outside interference. Because optical equipment is especially sensitive to
contamination, it must be ultra-clean. Payload instruments that require cryogenic
temperatures, absence of magnetic fields, or RF isolation call for special facilities
which may increase program cost and schedule.

12.3 Inspection and Quality Assurance

Quality assurance verifies that the manufacture and testing of the spacecraft and its
components conform to engineering data. MIL Q 9858A describes quality assurance
for military programs. Table 12-6 lists its elements: quality program management,
facilities and standards, control of purchases, and manufacturing control.

A key element in the quality program is establishing points in the production flow
where we can make sure the hardware construction complies with its engineering data
before the next step keeps us from inspecting it. In some cases, controlling the process
on the production line will ensure the hardware quality. Process inspection and control
thus substitutes for direct test.

We must also verify that vendors supplying spacecraft hardware have satisfactory
quality assurance programs by certifying their programs and periodically auditing
their performance.

Test surveillance involves certifying test equipment and procedures, witnessing
tests, approving test records, and reviewing results. Test equipment normally con-
forms to a reduced set of controlled engineering data such as mechanical assembly
drawings, parts lists, wire lists, panel photographs, and calibration test procedures.
Test surveillance personnel certify the construction and calibration of the test set. They
approve hardware tests, and they prepare and control the test data package. They also
formally review test results before the next operation proceeds. Generally, the test
conductor chairs the test review board, but test surveillance provides the records and
documents the results for the archives.

Quality assurance must maintain data records for formal tests and failures. Often
quality-assurance people keep all failed parts and record failure and anomaly results,
so they can identify repetitive failures and correct the design weaknesses. Although
formal procedures govern tests, troubleshooting may deviate from them. For such
operations, quality assurance approves and maintains records of the exact steps
involved.

12.4 The Qualification Program

Qualification tests of all flight-type hardware and software show that a spacecraft
design is suitable. These tests certify that the hardware and software work properly and
that the hardware can survive and operate in the prescribed environment. The qualifi-
cation program must test each component and the complete spacecraft. It may also
include functional or environmental testing of selected assemblies or subsystems.
Table 12-7 lists ways to qualify a spacecraft design.

We qualification test a component by checking how it performs (functional test)
and testing its ability to survive the anticipated environment. Each component is
powered and exercised by its own special-purpose test set during test. Component
environmental tests include vibration, shock and thermal vacuum. If the component
must survive nuclear weapons effects, it may also undergo a flash X-ray test, which
simulates the prompt radiation dose. Sometimes, it may need a test of electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC). Figure 12-1 shows a typical qualification sequence.

Fig. 12-1. Flow of Qualification Testing for Components. A component is qualified by a
series of functional tests and exposure to environmental conditions.

A component must withstand vibration caused when launch vehicle acoustics and
engine rumble couple to it through its structural mount. Vibration is a random-signal
spectrum of frequencies from 20 Hz to 2,000 Hz. Chapter 18 gives vibration data for
current launch vehicles. Figure 12-2 shows the vibration level for the Atlas-Centaur,
as well as acceptance and qualification spectra [General Dynamics Space Systems
Division, 1988]. The acceptance spectrum envelops the expected environment and is
higher than the conducted level specified by the launch-vehicle contractor to account
for structural resonances and acoustic input. The qualification spectrum is uniformly
6 dB higher than the acceptance spectrum. To vibrate a component, an electromechan-
ical shaker drives its base at a specified level of acceleration.

Components experience shocks from explosive release devices such as aero-
dynamic fairing separation or spacecraft separation bolts. The shock pulse is a
complex wave which induces mechanical response over a wide band of frequencies.
The pulse is specified by the peak acceleration response it excites in a mechanical sys-
tem with 5% damping—as a function of the mechanical system’s resonant frequency.
Chapter 18 shows shock-response spectra for various launch phenomena. Figure 12-3
shows the response spectra for acceptance and qualification of an Atlas-Centaur
device. We can use an electromechanical shaker to produce a shock pulse for compo-
nent testing, or we can mount the component on a test structure and hit the structure
with a calibrated hammer blow.

Component temperature requirements derive from the spacecraft’s thermal design.
To test a component under thermal vacuum, we mount it to a temperature-controlled
base plate inside a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber’s walls have thermal
shrouds for cooling or heating. Using conductive coupling to the base plate and radia-

12.4 The Qualification Program 527

tive coupling to the chamber walls, we can cycle the component through its specified
temperature range. The component must work at temperature extremes and during
transitions. The temperature extremes equal or slightly exceed expected temperatures
for the acceptance test and exceed expected temperatures by a margin (typically 11°C)
for the qualification test. Sometimes, the thermal-vacuum qualification test may
include a cold soak to demonstrate survival at low temperatures. Figure 12-4 shows a
typical temperature cycle.

We do not always know what a spacecraft “component” is. For example, we may
define the solar array and individual antennas as components and qualify them sepa-
rately, or we may test them environmentally as a part of the complete spacecraft. The
structure is tested by static loading but receives its environmental exposure as a part
of the spacecraft. Mechanical assemblies, such as deployment joints or hinges, may be
tested at qualification environmental levels separately as components or as part of the
spacecraft.

The qualification program should evaluate each spacecraft function and all
environmental effects the spacecraft may encounter. Table 12-8 lists the steps for
designing a qualification program. First, we must prepare a list of all spacecraft and
payload functions, as well as equipment (including redundancy), all modes of op-
eration (including failure modes and backups), and software code. The system and
subsystem specifications should provide this information. Second, we identify envi-
ronmental effects, including those on the launch vehicle (acoustics, vibration, and
shock) and in orbit (temperature, vacuum, and radiation). Third, we check to see which
spacecraft functions must be tested with each environment. Fourth, we identify the
major spacecraft configurations that require qualification, typically including a boost

528 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.4

configuration and one or more on-orbit configurations. Fifth, we devise functional
tests for each of these major configurations which completely evaluate the spacecraft.
Sixth, we lay out the sequence of tests and environmental exposures. Finally, we must
identify program span time and test equipment requirements.

TABLE 12-8. Steps in the Design of a Spacecraft Qualification Program. This is a typical
approach for a high reliability program.

1. Identify Spacecraft Test each spacecraft and paylcad function for proper
and Payload Functions operation. Identify the top functional requirements of the
spacecraft in the top system specification, and glean
subsystem functions from the subsystem specifications.

2. Identify Environments Environments for transportation and storage, launch, and
orbit include vibration, shock, temperature, vacuum, and
radiation.

3. Correlate Functions During transportation the spacecraft is off, although
and Environments sensitive components may be powered. During launch,
some equipment will be in standby and some will be
operating. Test the operating equipment during spacecraft
vibration and check all modes of on-orbit operation.

4. Identify Main Include boost configuration and one or more orbital
Configurations configurations.

5. Devise Functional Tests for Test each function appropriate to a particular configuration,
each Major Configuration including ali equipment and software.

7. Identify Span Times and
Special Facility Requirements

Some spacecraft functions are best demonstrated by testing a group of components
or assemblies under special conditions or with special test equipment or facilities.
These design verification tests (see Table 12-9) can even be run on nonflight (bread-
board or engineering model) equipment. They demonstrate proper equipment function
and allow simplified functional testing at the spacecraft level. For instance, a closed-
loop tracking test helps us evaluate performance of an antenna pointing control sys-
tem. During spacecraft test, the antenna feed can be stimulated by RF signals simulat-
ing those encountered during the closed-loop test, thus simplifying the test setup and
conduct.

components, subsystems, and systems.

12.5 Spacecraft Qualification Test Flow 529

12.5 Spacecraft Qualification Test Flow

The qualification test of a spacecraft is a lengthy and demanding process. Besides
proving the design, it may also be the first chance to evaluate the entire spacecraft in
operation. Some parts of the qualification test may provide data to validate the engi-
neering design and verify proper interaction of the equipment. Assembling the first
unit is particularly difficult because components are seldom available in the best se-
quence and unexpected interference and test peculiarities always occur. All operations
must be planned and executed under control and quality surveillance. Records must be
maintained and the results of each integration and test step reviewed before proceeding
to the next operation. Typically, tests to qualify a spacecraft last more than a year.

Spacecraft integration normally starts with delivery of an assembled structure or
structural frame. Liquid propulsion parts are assembled to the structure first because
the fields used to braze them together are not compatible with electronic components.
The spacecraft wiring harness can go on before or after the propulsion components.

Electronic assembly of the spacecraft commonly starts with electric power and
command and data handling subsystem components. Integration of the remaining sub-
systems depends more on the particular design. Although the subsystems may have
been preassembled and functionally tested, it is more common to integrate compo-
nents one at a time and test the subsystems after they are integrated on the spacecraft.

To test a spacecraft, a crew normally uses central control and display equipment,
with a computer for command generation, telemetry decoding, logging, display, and
automated test sequences. They operate the equipment by keyboard and monitor status
by video displays. These displays typically consist of an event screen that shows all
signal activity and page displays devoted to particular subsystem parameters. The test
set also provides stimuli and data-measurement equipment for end-to-end testing of
the spacecraft and payload subsystems. A complete spacecraft test may take several
days to run and involve subroutines for each subsystem or functional group. Such a
test is called an integrated system test (IST) or a comprehensive system test (CST). It
uses subroutines that test each subsystem, so we need to rerun only the subroutine for
a subsystem anomaly. We may also use a short version of this functional‘test at se-
lected points in the integration flow.

The qualification test sequence normally matches the expected flight sequence:
vibration, shock, and thermal vacuum. We also configure the spacecraft to match the
operational sequence by folding the solar array and deployables during vibration test
and deploying or removing them during thermal vacuum. Often the test facilities will
limit the test article’s size or the ability to perform particular tests. Figure 12-5 shows
a typical sequence along with the special test facilities used [Reeves, 1979]. First, the
mechanically integrated spacecraft goes through temperature cycling to verify proper
assembly. A comprehensive system test and performance testing of the payload then
take place in a special test facility. (For a communications satellite, this might be an
anechoic chamber or screen room.) Separate performance testing of the solar arrays
precedes their integration with the spacecraft. Vibration tests consist of acoustic
testing and vibration by low-frequency sine waves. The system must also pass a pyro-
shock test—firing of the deployment ordnance—and a check of the mechanical
deployments, Once the deployables are restowed, a thermal vacuum test of the folded
configuration follows. After demonstrating the deployments again, the test crew then
removes the deployables so the spacecraft will fit into the thermal vacuum (TV)
chamber. The spacecraft is then thermal vacuum tested in its orbital configuration. The

530 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.6

deployable units are tested in parallel with the spacecraft. An ambient comprehensive
system test and mechanical verification series complete the qualification. Integrated
system tests (shorter functional tests) supplement this sequence between each environ-
mental exposure and during TV test.

major activity.

During the qualification sequence, the test crew records all anomalies or out-of-
tolerance measurements and formally resolves each discrepancy. Anomalies which
result from operator error or malfunctioning test equipment and which do not damage
the spacecraft are easy to resolve. But spacecraft malfunctions demand thorough
investigation. If design errors have caused the problems, the design must be corrected
and retested. Test rules normally require rerun of an integrated system test (or all
affected subroutines) if any electrical, pneumatic, or hydraulic lines are disconnected.

12.6 Launch Site Operations

Spacecraft travel either by air or on air-cushioned trailers. Crews record vibration
during transport, and spacecraft packaging conforms to the specified environment.
Launch-site operations include installing and validating the test equipment (EAGE),
testing the spacecraft’s performance, installing propulsion (AKM), loading propellant,
mating the spacecraft to its launch vehicle, installing ordnance, and monitoring. Crews
may also install flight batteries at the launch site. Figure 12-6 shows a typical flow of
launch-site activities.

Fig. 12-6. Typical Launch-Site Activities. The time required for launch site activity may vary
from several months to several days.

Normally, one of the launch-site test hangars houses the spacecraft test set for
performance testing nearby. Crews install propulsion in an explosive ordnance area.
They mate the launch vehicle and spacecraft, load propellant, and install ordnance on
stand. Trained people conduct these hazardous tasks, using appropriate equipment and
safeguards. Some spacecraft components can be replaced at the launch site and even
on stand, but restricted access. to the spacecraft usually makes replacement difficult.
Much time at the launch site goes simply to monitoring the spacecraft’s state of health
through hard-line connections or, during some integrated tests, through RF links.
Spacecraft commanding is strictly controlled. Launch procedures include configuring
the spacecraft for launch and removing hard lines.
