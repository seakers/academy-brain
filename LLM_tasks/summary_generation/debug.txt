Slide 23:
 	Tasking, scheduling, control

	Includes 
	payload scheduling and control
	Spacecraft attitude and orbit control, others
	Same trade: Ground vs autonomous?
	Typically, attitude control is autonomous but orbit control is from the ground
	Payload scheduling is from the ground
Slide 27:
 	Space Observation
	Similar to Earth observation but used for on-orbit servicing, surveillance, monitoring orbital debris, etc.
	Agile satellites capable of proximity operations, with cooperative or uncooperative targets
	Payloads are adapted for smaller distances and challenging illumination conditions
Slide 16:
 	Which of the of following is likely to be the best prediction of spacecraft cost?
	Answer Choices:
	A)Satellite Dry Mass
	B)Satellite power at the beginning of life
	C)Propellant mass
	D)A complexity index accounting for several factors including all of the above

	The correct choice is D. Multiple factors have better predictability than one factor alone.

 	Elements of a space mission architecture

	Space Mission
	    Space Segment
	        Spacecraft Bus
	        Payload
	        Orbit
	    Launch Segment
	        Launch Vehicle
	    Ground Segment
	        Ground Stations
	        Mission Control

	Cost distribution between space/launch/ground segment is highly mission-dependent
Slide 21:
 	Timeline of an Earth observation mission
	Launch (~min to hours): Lift off, first stage separation, upper stage(s), fairing jettisoning, injection. May launch multiple satellites in different orbits.
	Orbit insertion (hours to weeks): Detumbling, Deploy antennas and solar panels, perform health tests, transfer to operational orbit
	Commissioning (weeks to months): Payload testing and calibration
	Nominal operations (~3-10 years): Acquire images, send down to Earth, perform station-keeping maneuvers, software updates. May include nominal orbital changes.
	Extended operations (0-10 years): If there is extra funding for ops, extend operations for current or new goals, in same or different orbit.
	End of life (deorbiting, hours to weeks): Reentry and burn through Earth‚Äôs atmosphere or move intro ‚Äúgraveyard‚Äù orbit
Slide 17:
 	Launch Segment

	The launch segment is in charge of putting the spacecraft(s) in their desired orbit(s)
	Requires a huge amount of propellant ü°∫ large rocket ü°∫ so more efficient to separate this from the spacecraft itself
	The launch segment consists of one or more launches from the same or different launch vehicles.
	Different launch vehicles have different sizes and can carry different amounts of weigh to various orbits
Slide 2:
 	In this module, you will get introduced to space missions and the space mission design process. 
	The module consists of 4 short lectures:
	    Introduction to Space. Why go to space? Why is space expensive? 
	    Overview of a Space Mission. Typical elements and concept of operations for a space mission.
	    Types of Space Missions and Payloads. Functions of space missions, architectures, payload types
	    Space Mission Design Process. Phases of the mission development process.
Slide 14:
 	Space Segment

	The space segment consists of one or more spacecraft
	Each spacecraft consists of
	A payload: the instrument(s) that collect(s) the mission data (e.g., cameras, radars)
	A spacecraft bus: the platform that provides power, communications, propulsion, attitude control, and other support to the payload. 

	Each spacecraft is put into an orbit, which is the trajectory they follow around a planetary body (e.g., Earth) 

	Choice of payload and orbit drive the design of the spacecraft bus and therefore drive space segment cost.

 	2. Overview of a Space Mission. 
	Typical elements and concept of operations for a space mission.
Slide 10:
 	Cost of access to space
	The average launch of a satellite on the order of a few hundreds to a few thousands of kg costs on the order of tens to hundreds of $M
	Cost of access to space is about $5k-$20k/kg
	Higher end for smaller expendable rockets
	Lower end for larger reusable rockets
	SpaceX in particular has disrupted this market and is bringing costs down closer to $1k/kg

Slide 15:
 	Spacecraft cost drivers

	Spacecraft mass is a commonly cited driver for space mission cost
	Many cost estimation relationships for space are based on mass
	More sophisticated cost models are based on complexity indexes
	Combine dozens of complexity factors such as payload and bus mass, power, data rate, lifetime, flight heritage, orbit‚Ä¶

Slide 31:
 	Summary
	The space missions and their design process can be summarized into the following topics:
	Introduction to Space
	 There are many motivations for space missions in the realms of exploration and science. There lies a challenge in reaching space with the large amount of kinetic energy required and in consequence the cost of launch.
	 Overview of space missions
	Space mission are divided into 3 segments: launch, ground, and space. Each segment consists of physical parameters or parts help the segment perform its function.
	Space missions and Payloads
	The type of spacecraft mission can depend on the intent/goal, customer context, or mission context. From this, an appropriate payload can be chosen. The types of satellites focused on in this module is Earth observation, space observation, communications, and navigation.
Slide 7:
 	Why is getting to space so hard?
	You need a lot of kinetic energy!
	Go up at least a few hundreds of km (overcome gravity, atmospheric drag, etc.)
	But that is not enough. You also need to accelerate tangentially up to ‚Äúorbital velocity‚Äù, or you would fall back down
	Orbital velocity is the velocity at which the centrifugal force pulling the satellite outwards exactly compensates for the gravitational force pulling the satellite inwards 
	About 7.5km/s (~16,700mph) + 1-2 km/s more for losses.
	Rockets are an inefficient way of getting that energy
	A lot of propellant is needed to reach that velocity
	Remember Newton‚Äôs action-reaction law? the center of mass of the system (rocket + propellant) doesn‚Äôt move, so if we want a heavy rocket to go up, a lot of propellant needs to go down
	Rockets are about 90% of propellant in weight
	Spend most of the energy (propellant) accelerating‚Ä¶ the propellant
Slide 3:
 	1. Introduction to Space
	Why go to space? Why is space expensive?
Slide 9:
 	Example Question
	Why is getting into space so difficult?
	Answer Choices:
	A)Strict regulation of propulsion technology
	B)Necessity of a large amount of Kinetic Energy
	C)Radiation present in the ozone layer interferes with rockets
	D)Companies disrupting the market and raising costs

	The correct choice is B. Overcoming the force of Gravity is difficult as well as the need to reach the point of Orbital Velocity.
Slide 8:
 	Space is expensive. Why?
	Getting to space (without falling right back) is hard!
	Rockets are inefficient
	Surviving in space is also hard!
	Small markets ‚Äì unique parts
	Labor-intensive
	Need for high reliability and ‚ÄúSpace Spiral‚Äù
	Some of this is changing with the recent push for distributed space architectures but still.

	Negative Feedback Cycle
	    Fewer missions
	    Higher reliability
	    Longer schedule
	    Higher cost

What are the challenges of getting to space?

Assistant:
The challenges of getting to space include the need for a large amount of kinetic energy to overcome gravity and atmospheric drag, and to reach orbital velocity, which is about 7.5 km/s plus additional speed for losses (Slide 7). Rockets, which are the means to achieve this, are inefficient as they are about 90% propellant by weight and spend most of their energy accelerating the propellant itself (Slide 7). Additionally, surviving in space is difficult due to the need for high reliability and unique parts for the harsh space environment, which leads to a negative feedback cycle of fewer missions, higher reliability requirements, longer schedules, and higher costs (Slide 6, Slide 8).
