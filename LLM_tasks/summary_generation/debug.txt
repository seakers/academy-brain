Slide 11:
 	Earth’s magnetosphere
	Magnetosphere is the region around Earth in which ions are controlled by the Earth’s magnetic field
	It protects us from solar and other radiation up to certain levels of energy
Slide 1:
 	Intro to Space Commodities
	Module 2: Space Environment and Orbits
	Dr. Daniel Selva (Texas A&M University)
	Dr. Alejandro Salado (University of Arizona)
Slide 14:
 	Solar Radiation – Geomagnetic storms
	Geomagnetic storms are temporary disturbances in the Earth magnetosphere due to interaction with solar radiation
	They create: Solar energetic particle events, Geomagnetically induced currents, Ionospheric disturbances, Auroras
	This creates multiple problems for spacecraft and astronauts
	 - Drag
	 - Spacecraft charging
	 - Radiation poisoning
	And even affect Earth’s infrastructure such as power grids!
Slide 21:
 	Orbital debris and meteoroids
	Can cause collisions that destroy [parts of] spacecraft
	All objects above 10cm are visible from Earth and are currently being monitored and carefully catalogued
Slide 33:
 	Orbit perturbations
	Another major orbit perturbation for very low Earth orbits is atmospheric drag which creates orbital decay below 600km
	There are several other sources of orbit perturbations:
	 - 3rd body effects (Moon and Sun) Solar radiation pressure
	 - Other harmonics (J4, J6), other planets, albedo, tidal effects, ...
	Magnitude of each depends strongly on altitude, but J2 is often strongest
	Example: 
	 - For a satellite at 300km, drag is as strong as J2 (really dominates)
	 - At 800km, J2 dominates
	 - At 36,000km, the Sun/Moon effects are as strong as J2
	Because of all these perturbations, spacecraft use propellant to keep their orbit parameters constant 
	 - This is called station-keeping
Slide 32:
 	Orbit perturbations – Effect of J2
	In the absence of any peturbations, the orbital parameters a, e, i, w, omega would stay constant over time
	 - The orientation of the orbital plane would stay fixed, independent of the motion of earth
	In reality, the plane rotates over time primarily because the earth is not a perfect sphere.
	 - This is nodal precession, a change in RAAN over time
	 - The earth's shape is modeled using spherical harmonics with many coefficients terms
	 - The largest coefficient is the ablateness of the earth, which is captured by the so-called J_2 parameter
	Rate of nodal precession is different for different orbits:
	 - precission_rate = -3/(2(1-e^2)^2) * n * J_2 * (R_e/a)^2 * cos(i), where n= 2pi / T
	J2 also causes the argument of the perigee to rotate within the orbital plane, which is called apsidal precession
Slide 7:
 	Atmospheric drag – Orbit/attitude disturbance
	We care about atmospheric density mostly because it affects the drag (D) seen by the satellite, which may lead to orbital decay and disturbance torques:
	D = (1/2)*p*V^2*C_d*A
	p  is the atmospheric density (varies exponentially but very small in orbit)
	C_d is the drag coefficient (2-4 are typical values for spacecraft)
	V is the orbital velocity
	Atmospheric drag is strong up to 500km, negligible after that
	    A CubeSat at 400km has 1-9 month lifespan, and 600km one has over 25 years lifespan
Slide 26:
 	Conic sections, open vs closed orbits
	More generally, orbital trajectories can follow the shape of any conic section (circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola)
	Circular and elliptical orbits (0 <= eccentricity < 1) are "closed orbits" around earth
	A satellite with sufficient energy (eccentricity >= 1) will escape earth and follow an interplanetary trajectory that never comes back (i.e. open orbits)
	 - when eccentricity = 1, it follows a parabolic trajectory
	 - when eccentricity > 1 it follows a hyperbolic trajectory
	Hyperbola:
Slide 17:
 	Van Allen Radiation Belts
	The Van Allen Belts are 2 regions of trapped fast charged particles (electrons and protons)
	 - Inner belt: 1,000-6,000km altitude
	 - Outer belt: 13,000-60,000km
	Most LEO satellites are below the 1st ring (inner belt) so they have a more benign radiation environment
	MEO satellites are in the middle of the 2nd ring (outer belt) so they see more radiation (e.g., GPS satellites)
	GEO satellites are in the edge of the outer belt (radiation also a problem)
	The South Atlantic Anomaly is a range of longitudes where the Earth’s magnetic field is weaker and thus radiation is worse. Leads to more radiation-related spacecraft failures.
Slide 20:
 	Orbital debris and meteoroids
	Any non-operational object in orbit is considered debris
	Includes mission-related debris, such as
	 - Pieces of dead satellites
	 - Pieces of launch vehicles (fairings, inter-stage adapters)
	 - Others (e.g., Ed White’s glove from Gemini 4 mission)
	And naturally occurring debris
	 - Micrometeoroids
	 - Asteroid particles
	Mostly concentrated around most populated orbits (e.g., GPS and GEO orbits)
Slide 27:
 	Position of a satellite within its orbit
	The true anomaly 'theta' is an angle that defines where within the orbit the satellite is at a given point in time.
	There are two special points:
	 - the perigee is the point where it is closest to the earth
	 - the apogee is the point where it is farthest from earth
	Given semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), and theta, we can compute the satellite position r, i.e. the distance betwseen the satellite and earth
	 - r(theta) = (a*(1-e^2))/(1+e*cos(theta))
Slide 29:
 	Orbital parameters, period
	Together, the 6 orbital parameters semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination (i), argument of perigee (w), right ascension of the ascending node (omega), and true anomaly (theta) fully define the trajectory of the satellite
	 - from these 6 parameters, we can calculate anything: the satellite position, velocity, etc.
	For example, from kepler's laws, we can calculate the orbital period (T), aka the time it takes the satellite to go around its orbit once:
	 - T = (1/2*pi) * sqrt(a^3 / G*M)
	Where G = 6.67*10^(-11) (Newton * meter^2 / kilogram^2) is the gravitational constant and M = 5.97*10^24 kg is the mass of earth
	Note that it only depends on the semi-major axis!
Slide 5:
 	“Microgravity”
	Objects are in “free fall”, not absence of gravity!
	    Gravity compensated by centrifugal force due to orbital speed 
	Near absence of gravity (~10-6 g) means that:
	    Objects don’t fall
	    Bubbles don’t rise
	    Particles don’t settle in a solution
	    No convection (eliminates an important heat transfer mechanism!)
	This presents challenges, mostly for astronauts…
	    Bone loss
	    Muscle loss
	    Cardiovascular problems
	    Immune system
	…but also opportunities
	    Formation of large crystals
	The effects on traditional Earth satellites are relatively benign (e.g., lower structural stresses when in orbit)
Slide 25:
 	Shape of orbits
	Satellite orbits are generally ellipses
	The earth (or central body) sits in one of the focus points
	An ellipse is usually defined by 2 parameters:
	 - the semimajor-axis a is half the length of the longer axis (increasing 'a' makes the orbit "bigger", further from earth)
	 - Eccentricity e tells us how elongated the ellipse is (when e = 0 the orbit is circular)
	Together, a and e define the shape of the orbit
Slide 23:
 	2. Introduction to orbits
Slide 30:
 	Orbital velocity
	Similarly, using the vis-viva equation (conservation of energy), we can compute the velocity of the satellite:
	 - V = sqrt(G*M*(2/r - 1/a)) where r is distance from earth and a is semi-major axis
	For a general elliptical orbit, we see that as predicted by Kepler's laws, the satellite will move faster the closer it gets to Earth, and will slow down as it gets farther from Earth
	For a circular orbit, r = a = R_e + h, where R_e = 6370km is the radius of earth and h is the orbit altitude. In this case, the velocity is constant:
	 - V = sqrt(G*M*(1/(R_e + h)))
Slide 34:
 	Ground tracks
	The ground track is the projection of the position of satellite on the Earth’s surface (lat,lon) over time
	 - They are a useful visualization of an orbit since they show which regions are “seen”
	Can infer orbital parameters from ground tracks
	 - Inclination from max latitude
	 - Period (and thus semimajor axis) from equatorial orbit shift between consecutive tracks
Slide 28:
 	Orientation of the orbit and orbital plane
	The orbit lies on a plane called the orbital plane that intersects the Earth's equatorial plane (i.e. at 0 degrees latitude) at two points called the nodes:
	 - Ascending node: where the satellite is going north
	 - Descending node: where it is going south
	The orientation of the orbit (the ellipse) within the orbital plane is defined by an angle called the argument of perigee
	 - Angle from the ascending node to the perigee from the earth center, 'w'
	The orientation of the orbital plane with respect to the Earth is defined by two angles:
	 - the inclination 'i' is the tilt angle between the orbital plane and the equatorial plane
	 - the right ascension of the ascending node (called RAAN) 'omega' is the twist angle of the orbital plane, from the vernal equinox (a fixed direction in space) to the ascending node.
Slide 31:
 	Example: What is the orbital period and velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit around Earth at 600km altitude?
	The orbital period is:
	 - T = (1/2pi) * sqrt(a^3/(G*M)) = 96.7min
	The orbital velocity is:
	 - V = sqrt((G*M)/(R_e + h)) = 7.56km/s
	In general, satellites in low Earth orbits (400-800km altitudes) have periods of ~92-100 minutes and velocities of ~7.4-7.7 km/s
	Period increases with altitude whereas velocity decreases with it
	The special altitude that leads to a period of 24h is about 36,000km, this is called a geosynchronous orbit
Slide 24:
 	What are orbits?
	Orbits are the trajectories that spacecraft “naturally” follow around the Earth due to gravitational forces
	Any two objects under each other’s gravitational force will “orbit each other”
	 - This is called the 2-body problem
	When one is much larger than the other (e.g., a satellite vs Earth, or the Earth vs the Sun) the motion of the large object is largely unaffected and it all happens as if the small object rotates around the large object
"""

What does geosynchronous orbit mean?

Assistant:
Geosynchronous orbit is a special altitude that leads to a period of 24 hours, about 36,000km, where satellites match Earth's rotation period (Slide 31).
